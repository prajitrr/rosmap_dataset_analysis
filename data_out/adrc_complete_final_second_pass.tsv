0	Quetiapine	WIKIPEDIA	"Quetiapine, sold under the brand name Seroquel among others, is an atypical antipsychotic medication used for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Despite being widely used as a sleep aid due to its tranquillizing effects, the benefits of such use may not outweigh the risk of undesirable side effects. It is taken orally. Common side effects include sedation, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and dry mouth. Other side effects include low blood pressure with standing, seizures, a prolonged erection, high blood sugar, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In older people with dementia, its use increases the risk of death. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result in a movement disorder in the baby for some time after birth. Quetiapine is believed to work by blocking a number of receptors, including those for serotonin and dopamine. Quetiapine was developed in 1985 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 82nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Quetiapine is primarily used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Quetiapine targets both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. === Schizophrenia === A 2013 Cochrane review compared quetiapine to typical antipsychotics: In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in effectiveness in treating schizophrenia, quetiapine demonstrated standard effectiveness. It was 13–16% more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine and approximately as effective as haloperidol and aripiprazole. There is tentative evidence of the benefit of quetiapine versus placebo in schizophrenia; however, definitive conclusions are not possible due to the high rate of attrition in trials (greater than 50%) and the lack of data on economic outcomes, social functioning, or quality of life. It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are more effective. Both have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates when typicals are used at low to moderate dosages. While quetiapine has lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects, there is greater sleepiness and rates of dry mouth. A Cochrane review comparing quetiapine to other atypical antipsychotic agents tentatively concluded that it may be less efficacious than olanzapine and risperidone; produce fewer movement related side effects than paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, risperidone and olanzapine; and produce weight gain similar to risperidone, clozapine and aripiprazole. They concluded that it produces suicide attempt, suicide; death; QTc prolongation, low blood pressure; tachycardia; sedation; gynaecomastia; galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularity and white blood cell count at a rate similar to first generation antipsychotics. === Bipolar disorder === In those with bipolar disorder, quetiapine is used to treat depressive episodes; acute manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (as either monotherapy or adjunct therapy to lithium; valproate or lamotrigine); acute mixed episodes; and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (as adjunct therapy to lithium or divalproex). === Major depressive disorder === Quetiapine is effective when used by itself and when used along with other medications in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, sedation is often an undesirable side effect. In the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia (while not subsidised by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for treatment of MDD), quetiapine is licensed for use as an add-on treatment in MDD. === Alzheimer's disease === Quetiapine does not decrease agitation among people with Alzheimer's disease. Quetiapine worsens intellectual functioning in the elderly with dementia and therefore is not recommended. === Insomnia === The use of low doses of quetiapine for insomnia, while common, is not recommended; there is little evidence of benefit and concerns regarding adverse effects. A 2022 network meta-analysis of 154 double-blind, randomized controlled trials of drug therapies vs. placebo for insomnia in adults found that quetiapine did not demonstrate any short-term benefits in sleep quality. Quetiapine, specifically, had an effect size (standardized mean difference) against placebo for treatment of insomnia of 0.05 (95% CITooltip confidence interval –1.21 to 1.11) at 4 weeks of treatment, with the certainty of evidence rated as very low. Doses of quetiapine used for insomnia have ranged from 12.5 to 800 mg, with low doses of 25 to 200 mg being the most typical. Regardless of the dose used, some of the more serious adverse effects may still possibly occur at the lower dosing ranges, such as dyslipidemia and neutropenia. These safety concerns at low doses are corroborated by Danish observational studies that showed use of specifically low-dose quetiapine (prescriptions filled for tablet strengths >50 mg were excluded) was associated with an increased risk of major cardiovascular events as compared to use of Z-drugs, with most of the risk being driven by cardiovascular death. Laboratory data from an unpublished analysis of the same cohort also support the lack of dose-dependency of metabolic side effects, as new use of low-dose quetiapine was associated with a risk of increased fasting triglycerides at 1-year follow-up. === Others === It is sometimes used off-label, often as an augmentation agent, to treat conditions such as Tourette syndrome, musical hallucinations and anxiety disorders. Quetiapine and clozapine are the most widely used medications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis due to their relatively low extrapyramidal side-effect liability. Owing to the risks associated with clozapine (e.g. agranulocytosis, diabetes mellitus, etc.), clinicians often attempt treatment with quetiapine first, although the evidence to support quetiapine's use for this indication is significantly weaker than that of clozapine. == Adverse effects == Sources for incidence lists: Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects Dry mouth Dizziness Headache Somnolence (drowsiness; of 15 antipsychotics quetiapine causes the 5th most sedation. Extended release (XR) formulations tend to produce less sedation, dose-by-dose, than the immediate release formulations.) Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects Extrapyramidal disease: Quetiapine and clozapine are noted for their relative lack of extrapyramidal side effects. Weight gain: SMD 0.43 kg when compared to placebo. Produces roughly as much weight gain as risperidone, less weight gain than clozapine, olanzapine and zotepine and more weight gain than ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole and asenapine. As with many other atypical antipsychotics, this action is likely due to its actions at the H1 histamine receptor and 5-HT2C receptor. Rare (<1% incidence) adverse effects Neuroleptic malignant syndrome a rare and potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic drug treatment. It is characterised by the following symptoms: tremor, rigidity, hyperthermia, tachycardia, mental status changes (e.g. confusion), etc. Tardive dyskinesia. A rare and often irreversible neurological condition characterised by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, lips and rest of the body. Most commonly occurs after prolonged treatment with antipsychotics. It is believed to be particularly uncommon with atypical antipsychotics, especially quetiapine and clozapine Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia. According to one study, rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% as opposed to the typicals at 5.5%. Although quetiapine and clozapine are atypical antipsychotics, switching to these atypicals is an option to minimize symptoms of tardive dyskinesia caused by other atypicals. Weight gain can be a problem for some, with quetiapine causing more weight gain than fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, molindone, olanzapine, pimozide, risperidone, thioridazine, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, and ziprasidone, but less than chlorpromazine, clozapine, perphenazine, and sertindole. As with some other anti-psychotics, quetiapine may lower the seizure threshold, and should be taken with caution in combination with drugs such as bupropion. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. === Pregnancy and lactation === Placental exposure is least for quetiapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics. The evidence is insufficient to rule out any risk to the foetus but available data suggests it is unlikely to result in any major foetal malformations. It is secreted in breast milk and hence quetiapine-treated mothers are advised not to breastfeed. === Abuse potential === In contrast to most other antipsychotic drugs, which tend to be somewhat aversive and often show problems with patient compliance with prescribed medication regimes, quetiapine is sometimes associated with drug misuse and abuse potential, for its hypnotic and sedative effects. It has a limited potential for misuse, usually only in individuals with a history of polysubstance abuse and/or mental illness, and especially in those incarcerated in prisons or secure psychiatric facilities where access to alternative intoxicants is more limited. To a significantly greater extent than other atypical antipsychotic drugs, quetiapine was found to be associated with drug-seeking behaviors, and to have standardised street prices and slang terms associated with it, either by itself or in combination with other drugs (such as ""Q-ball"" for the intravenous injection of quetiapine mixed with cocaine). The pharmacological basis for this distinction from other second generation antipsychotic drugs is unclear, though it has been suggested that quetiapine's comparatively lower dopamine receptor affinity and strong antihistamine activity might mean it could be regarded as more similar to sedating antihistamines in this context. While these issues have not been regarded as sufficient cause for placing quetiapine under increased legal controls, prescribers have been urged to show caution when prescribing quetiapine to individuals with characteristics that might place them at increased risk for drug misuse. == Overdose == Most instances of acute overdosage result in only sedation, hypotension and tachycardia, but cardiac arrhythmia, coma and death have occurred in adults. Serum or plasma quetiapine concentrations are usually in the 1–10 mg/L range in overdose survivors, while postmortem blood levels of 10–25 mg/L are generally observed in fatal cases. Non-toxic levels in postmortem blood extend to around 0.8 mg/kg, but toxic levels in postmortem blood can begin at 0.35 mg/kg. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Quetiapine has the following pharmacological actions: Dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 receptor antagonist Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT1F receptor ligand α1- and α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist Histamine H1 receptor antagonist Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist This means quetiapine is a dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic antagonist, and a potent antihistamine with some anticholinergic properties. Quetiapine binds strongly to serotonin receptors; the drug acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors and as an antagonist to all other serotonin receptors it has affinity for. Serial PET scans evaluating the D2 receptor occupancy of quetiapine have demonstrated that quetiapine very rapidly disassociates from the D2 receptor. Theoretically, this allows for normal physiological surges of dopamine to elicit normal effects in areas such as the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways, thus minimizing the risk of side-effects such as pseudo-parkinsonism as well as elevations in prolactin. Some of the antagonized receptors (serotonin, norepinephrine) are actually autoreceptors whose blockade tends to increase the release of neurotransmitters. At very low doses, quetiapine acts primarily as a histamine receptor blocker (antihistamine) and α1-adrenergic blocker. When the dose is increased, quetiapine activates the adrenergic system and binds strongly to serotonin receptors and autoreceptors. At high doses, quetiapine starts blocking significant amounts of dopamine receptors. Due to the drug's sedating H1 activity, it is often prescribed at low doses for insomnia. While some feel that low doses of drugs with antihistamine effects like quetiapine and mirtazapine are safer than drugs associated with physical dependency or other risk factors, concern has been raised by some professionals that off-label prescribing has become too widespread due to underappreciated hazards. When treating schizophrenia, antagonism of D2 receptor by quetiapine in the mesolimbic pathway relieves positive symptoms and antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptor in the frontal cortex of the brain may relieve negative symptoms and reduce severity of psychotic episodes. Quetiapine has fewer extrapyramidal side effects and is less likely to cause hyperprolactinemia when compared to other drugs used to treat schizophrenia, so is used as a first line treatment. === Pharmacokinetics === Peak levels of quetiapine occur 1.5 hours after a dose. The plasma protein binding of quetiapine is 83%. The major active metabolite of quetiapine is norquetiapine (N-desalkylquetiapine). Quetiapine has an elimination half-life of 6 or 7 hours. Its metabolite, norquetiapine, has a half-life of 9 to 12 hours. Quetiapine is excreted primarily via the kidneys (73%) and in feces (20%) after hepatic metabolism, the remainder (1%) is excreted as the drug in its unmetabolized form. == Chemistry == Quetiapine is a tetracyclic compound and is closely related structurally to clozapine, olanzapine, loxapine, and other tetracyclic antipsychotics. === Synthesis === The synthesis of quetiapine begins with a dibenzothiazepinone. The lactam is first treated with phosphoryl chloride to produce a dibenzothiazepine. A nucleophilic substitution is used to introduce the sidechain. == History == === Sustained-release === AstraZeneca submitted a new drug application for a sustained-release version of quetiapine in the United States, Canada, and the European Union in the second half of 2006 for treatment of schizophrenia. In May 2007, the US FDA approved Seroquel XR for acute treatment of schizophrenia. During its 2007 Q2 earnings conference, AstraZeneca announced plans to launch Seroquel XR in the U.S. during August 2007. However, Seroquel XR has become available in U.S. pharmacies only after the FDA approved Seroquel XR for use as maintenance treatment for schizophrenia, in addition to acute treatment of the illness, on 16 November 2007. The company has not provided a reason for the delay of Seroquel XR's launch. Health Canada approved sale of Seroquel XR on 27 September 2007. In October 2008, the FDA approved Seroquel XR for the treatment of bipolar depression and bipolar mania. In December 2008, Biovail announced that the FDA had accepted the company's ANDA to market its own version of sustained-release quetiapine. Biovail's sustained-release tablets will compete with AstraZeneca's Seroquel XR. In December 2008, AstraZeneca notified shareholders that the FDA had asked for additional information on the company's application to expand the use of sustained-release quetiapine for treatment of depression. == Society and culture == === Regulatory status === In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar mania) and for treatment of bipolar depression. In 2009, quetiapine XR was approved as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. Quetiapine received its initial approval from the US FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in 1997. In 2004, it received its second indication for the treatment of mania-associated bipolar disorder. In 2007 and 2008, studies were conducted on quetiapine's efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and major depression. Patent protection for the product ended in 2012; however, in a number of regions, the long-acting version remained under patent until 2017. === Lawsuits === In April 2010, the U. S. Department of Justice fined AstraZeneca $520 million for the company's aggressive marketing of Seroquel for off-label uses. According to the Department of Justice, ""the company recruited doctors to serve as authors of articles that were ghostwritten by medical literature companies and about studies the doctors in question did not conduct. AstraZeneca then used those studies and articles as the basis for promotional messages about unapproved uses of Seroquel."" Multiple lawsuits have been filed in relation to quetiapine's side-effects, in particular, diabetes. Approximately 10,000 lawsuits have been filed against AstraZeneca, alleging that quetiapine caused problems ranging from slurred speech and chronic insomnia to deaths. === Controversy === In 2004, a young man named Dan Markingson committed suicide in a controversial Seroquel clinical trial at the University of Minnesota while under an involuntary commitment order. A group of University of Minnesota bioethicists charged that the trial involved an alarming number of ethical violations. === Nurofen Plus tampering case === In August 2011, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a class-4 drug alert following reports that some batches of Nurofen plus contained Seroquel XL tablets instead. Following the issue of the Class-4 Drug Alert, Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd received further reports of rogue blister strips in cartons of two additional batches of Nurofen Plus tablets. One of the new batches contained Seroquel XL 50 mg tablets and one contained the Pfizer product Neurontin 100 mg capsules. Following discussions with the MHRA's Defective Medicines Report Centre (DMRC), Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd decided to recall all remaining unexpired stock of Nurofen Plus tablets in any pack size, leading to a Class-1 Drug Alert. The contamination was later traced to in-store tampering by a customer. == References == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
2	Raloxifene	WIKIPEDIA	Raloxifene, sold under the brand name Evista among others, is a medication used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and those on glucocorticoids. For osteoporosis it is less preferred than bisphosphonates. It is also used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include hot flashes, leg cramps, swelling, and joint pain. Severe side effects may include blood clots and stroke. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. The medication may worsen menstrual symptoms. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and therefore a mixed agonist–antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER). It has estrogenic effects in bone and antiestrogenic effects in the breasts and uterus. Raloxifene was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 292nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Raloxifene is used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for both the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. In the case of either osteoporosis prevention or treatment, supplemental calcium and vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate. Raloxifene is used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for this indication. In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) clinical trial, raloxifene decreased the risk of all types of breast cancer by 62%, of invasive breast cancer by 72%, and of invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 84%. Conversely, it does not reduce the risk of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. There were no obvious differences in effectiveness of raloxifene in the MORE trial for prevention of breast cancer at a dosage of 60 mg/m2/day relative to 120 mg/m2/day. In the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial, 60 mg/day raloxifene was 78% as effective as 20 mg/day tamoxifen in preventing non-invasive breast cancer. Women with undetectable levels of estradiol (<2.7 pg/mL) have a naturally low risk of breast cancer and, in contrast to women with detectable levels of estradiol, do not experience significant benefit from raloxifene in terms of reduction of breast cancer risk. == Contraindications == Raloxifene is contraindicated in lactating women or women who are or who may become pregnant. It also may be of concern to women with active or past history of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis. == Side effects == Common side effects of raloxifene include hot flashes (25–28% vs. 18–21% for placebo), vaginal dryness, and leg cramps (generally mild; 5.5% vs. 1.9% for placebo). Raloxifene does not cause breast tenderness, endometrial hyperplasia, menstrual bleeding, or endometrial cancer. It does not appear to affect cognition or memory. Raloxifene is a teratogen; i.e., it can cause developmental abnormalities such as birth defects. Raloxifene may infrequently cause serious blood clots to form in the legs, lungs, or eyes. Other reactions experienced include leg swelling/pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, and vision changes. Black box warnings were added to the label of raloxifene in 2007 warning of increased risk of death due to stroke for postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for major coronary events, as well as increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The risk of venous thromboembolism with raloxifene is increased by several-fold in postmenopausal women (RRTooltip relative risk = 3.1). Raloxifene has a lower risk of thromboembolism than tamoxifen. In the MORE trial, raloxifene caused a 40% decrease in risk of cardiovascular events in women who were at increased risk for coronary artery disease, although there was no decrease in cardiovascular events for the group as a whole. A report in September 2009, from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen and raloxifene used to treat breast cancer, significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. A human case report in July 2016, suggests that raloxifene may in fact, at some point, also stimulate breast cancer growth leading to a reduction of advanced breast cancer disease upon the withdrawal of the drug. Unlike other SERMs, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene has no risk of uterine hyperplasia or endometrial cancer (RRTooltip relative risk = 0.8). Raloxifene does not increase the incidence of breast pain or tenderness in postmenopausal women. == Overdose == Raloxifene has been studied in clinical trials across a dosage range of 30 to 600 mg/day, and was well-tolerated at all dosages. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Mechanism of action ==== Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and hence is a mixed agonist and antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) in different tissues. It has estrogenic activity in some tissues, such as bone and the liver, and antiestrogenic activity in other tissues, such as the breasts and uterus. Its affinity (Kd) for the ERα is approximately 50 pM, which is similar to that of estradiol. Relative to estradiol, raloxifene has been reported to possess about 8 to 34% of the affinity for the ERα and 0.5 to 76% of the affinity for the ERβ. Raloxifene acts as a partial agonist of the ERα and as a pure antagonist of the ERβ. In contrast to the classical ERs, raloxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 10–100 nM), a membrane estrogen receptor. ==== Clinical effects ==== Raloxifene has antiestrogenic effects in the mammary glands in preclinical studies. In accordance, raloxifene reduces breast density in postmenopausal women, a known risk factor for breast cancer. It does not stimulate the uterus in postmenopausal women, and results in no increase in risk of endometrial thickening, vaginal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer. At the same time, raloxifene has minimal antiestrogenic effect in the uterus in premenopausal women. This may possibly be due to inadequate tissue exposure of the uterus to raloxifene in these estrogen-rich individuals. In premenopausal women, raloxifene increases levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol. Conversely, in postmenopausal women, raloxifene has been found to reduce levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, while not affecting levels of estradiol. Raloxifene also decreases prolactin levels in postmenopausal women. In men, raloxifene has been found to disinhibit the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) and thereby increase total testosterone levels. Due to the simultaneous increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels however, free testosterone levels often remain unchanged in men during therapy with raloxifene. Raloxifene has estrogenic effects on liver protein synthesis. It increases SHBG levels in both pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men. The medication decreases levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B, and homocysteine. Conversely, it has little effect on levels of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Raloxifene has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of LDL cholesterol in vitro. The medication has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men. It has also been found to increase insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women. Due to activation of estrogen receptors in the liver, raloxifene has procoagulatory effects, such as decreasing levels of fibrinogen and influencing levels of other coagulation factors. For these reasons, raloxifene increases the risk of thrombosis. Raloxifene increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women but decreases it in premenopausal women. In the MORE trial, the risk of vertebral fractures was decreased by 30%, and bone mineral density was increased in the spine (by 2.1% at 60 mg, 2.4% at 120 mg) and femoral neck (2.6% at 60 mg, 2.7% at 120 mg). It has been found to possess estrogenic effects in adipose tissue in postmenopausal women, promoting a shift from an android fat distribution to a gynoid fat distribution. The medication has been found to increase levels of leptin, an adipokine. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The absorption of raloxifene is approximately 60%. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, the absolute bioavailability of raloxifene is only 2.0%. Raloxifene is rapidly absorbed from the intestines upon oral administration. Peak plasma levels of raloxifene occur 0.5 to 6 hours after an oral dose. In healthy postmenopausal women treated with 60 mg/day raloxifene, peak circulating raloxifene levels normalized by dose and body weight were (i.e., divided by (mg/kg)), 0.50 ng/mL (500 pg/mL) after a single dose and 1.36 ng/mL (1,360 pg/mL after multiple doses). ==== Distribution ==== Raloxifene is widely distributed throughout the body. There is extensive distribution of raloxifene into the liver, serum, lungs, and kidneys. The volume of distribution of raloxifene with a single 30 to 150 mg oral dose is approximately 2348 L/kg, which corresponds to ~170,000 L for a 72 kg person. Both raloxifene and its glucuronide metabolites show high plasma protein binding (>95%), including to both albumin and α1 acid glycoprotein, but not to sex hormone-binding globulin. More specifically, raloxifene is 98.2 ± 0.4% bound to plasma proteins. ==== Metabolism ==== Raloxifene is metabolized in the liver and undergoes enterohepatic recycling. It is metabolized exclusively by glucuronidation and is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Less than 1% of radiolabeled material in plasma comprises unconjugated raloxifene. The metabolites of raloxifene include several glucuronides. The elimination half-life of raloxifene after a single dose is 27.7 hours (1.2 days), whereas its half-life at steady state at a dosage of 60 mg/day is 15.8 to 86.6 hours (0.7–3.6 days), with an average of 32.5 hours (1.4 days). The extended half-life of raloxifene is attributed to enterohepatic recirculation and its high plasma protein binding. Raloxifene and its glucuronide conjugates are interconverted by reversible metabolism and enterohepatic recycling, which prolongs the elimination half-life of raloxifene with oral administration. The medication is deconjugated into its active form in a variety of tissues, including liver, lungs, spleen, bone, uterus, and kidneys. ==== Elimination ==== Raloxifene is mainly excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces. Less than 0.2% of a dose is excreted unchanged in urine and less than 6% of a dose is excreted in urine as glucuronide conjugates. == Chemistry == Raloxifene hydrochloride has the empirical formula C28H27NO4S•HCl, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 510.05 g/mol. Raloxifene hydrochloride is an off-white to pale-yellow solid that is slightly soluble in water. Raloxifene is a benzothiophene derivative and is structurally distinct from the triphenylethylene SERMs like tamoxifen, clomifene, and toremifene. It is the only benzothiophene SERM to have been marketed. A benzothiophene SERM that was not marketed is arzoxifene (LY-353381). Bazedoxifene (Duavee, Viviant) and pipendoxifene (ERA-923) are structurally related to raloxifene but are technically not benzothiophenes and instead are indoles. == History == Raloxifene was approved in the United States for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 1997, the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 1999, and to prevent or reduce the risk of breast cancer in certain postmenopausal women in 2007. It received orphan designation in 2005. == Society and culture == === Names === Raloxifene is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while raloxifène is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and raloxifene hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It has also been known by the name keoxifene. Raloxifene is sold mainly under the brand name Evista and to a lesser extent the brand name Optruma. It is also sold under a variety of other brand names in various countries. === Availability === Raloxifene is available widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, elsewhere throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Latin America, Southern, Eastern, and Southeastern Asia, and elsewhere in the world such as in Israel and Egypt. Raloxifene is provided in the form of 60 mg oral tablets. === Controversy === An editorial in Lancet Oncology criticized the way that research about the medication for breast cancer prevention was released. == Research == Clinical studies of raloxifene for metastatic breast cancer in women have been conducted but found little effectiveness at 60 mg/day in those previously treated with tamoxifen, though modest effectiveness has been observed at higher doses. In contrast to tamoxifen, raloxifene is not approved for the treatment of breast cancer. Raloxifene has been studied in men for a variety of uses, such as for treatment of schizophrenia, prostate cancer, and osteoporosis. It has been studied in combination with castration and bicalutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, for the treatment of prostate cancer. Raloxifene has been studied as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia in postmenopausal women. A 2017 meta-analysis concluded that it was safe and effective for this indication, although further studies with larger sample sizes are needed for confirmation. It may be effective in women with less severe symptoms. A tissue-selective estrogen-receptor complex (TSEC) of estradiol and raloxifene has been studied in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene (60 mg/day) was reported to be effective in the treatment of pubertal gynecomastia in adolescent boys in a small retrospective chart review. Other SERMs are also known to be effective in the treatment of gynecomastia. Raloxifene has been reported to augment the antidepressant effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). == References == == Further reading ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
4	Mannitol	WIKIPEDIA	"Mannitol is a type of sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and medication. It is used as a low calorie sweetener as it is poorly absorbed by the intestines. As a medication, it is used to decrease pressure in the eyes, as in glaucoma, and to lower increased intracranial pressure. Medically, it is given by injection or inhalation. Effects typically begin within 15 minutes and last up to 8 hours. Common side effects from medical use include electrolyte problems and dehydration. Other serious side effects may include worsening heart failure and kidney problems. It is unclear if use is safe in pregnancy. Mannitol is in the osmotic diuretic family of medications and works by pulling fluid from the brain and eyes. The discovery of mannitol is attributed to Joseph Louis Proust in 1806. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally made from the flowering ash and called manna due to its supposed resemblance to the Biblical food. Mannitol is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned substances list due to concerns that it may mask prohibited drugs. == Uses == === Medical uses === In the United States, mannitol is indicated for the reduction of intracranial pressure and treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intraocular pressure. In the European Union, mannitol is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an add-on therapy to best standard of care. Mannitol is used intravenously to reduce acutely raised intracranial pressure until more definitive treatment can be applied, e.g., after head trauma. While mannitol injection is the mainstay for treating high pressure in the skull after a bad brain injury, it is no better than hypertonic saline as a first-line treatment. In treatment-resistant cases, hypertonic saline works better. Intra-arterial infusions of mannitol can transiently open the blood–brain barrier by disrupting tight junctions. It may also be used for certain cases of kidney failure with low urine output, decreasing pressure in the eye, to increase the elimination of certain toxins, and to treat fluid build up. Intraoperative mannitol prior to vessel clamp release during renal transplant has been shown to reduce post-transplant kidney injury, but has not been shown to reduce graft rejection. Mannitol acts as an osmotic laxative in oral doses larger than 20 g, and is sometimes sold as a laxative for children. The use of mannitol, when inhaled, as a bronchial irritant as an alternative method of diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma has been proposed. A 2013 systematic review concluded evidence to support its use for this purpose at this time is insufficient. Mannitol is commonly used in the circuit prime of a heart lung machine during cardiopulmonary bypass. The presence of mannitol preserves renal function during the times of low blood flow and pressure, while the patient is on bypass. The solution prevents the swelling of endothelial cells in the kidney, which may have otherwise reduced blood flow to this area and resulted in cell damage. Mannitol can also be used to temporarily encapsulate a sharp object (such as a helix on a lead for an artificial pacemaker) while it passes through the venous system. Because the mannitol dissolves readily in blood, the sharp point becomes exposed at its destination. Mannitol is also the first drug of choice to treat acute glaucoma in veterinary medicine. It is administered as a 20% solution intravenously. It dehydrates the vitreous humor and, therefore, lowers the intraocular pressure. However, it requires an intact blood-ocular barrier to work. === Food === Mannitol increases blood glucose to a lesser extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of mannitol also makes it a popular excipient for chewable tablets. === Analytical chemistry === Mannitol can be used to form a complex with boric acid. This increases the acid strength of the boric acid, permitting better precision in volumetric analysis of this acid. === Other === Mannitol is the primary ingredient of mannitol salt agar, a bacterial growth medium, and is used in others. Mannitol is used as a cutting agent in various drugs that are used intranasally (snorted), such as heroin and cocaine. A mixture of mannitol and fentanyl (or fentanyl analogs) in ratio 1:10 is labeled and sold as ""China white"", a popular heroin substitute. Mannitol is a sugar alcohol with ""50-70 percent of the relative sweetness of sugar, which means more must be used to equal the sweetness of sugar. Mannitol lingers in the intestines for a long time and therefore often causes bloating and diarrhea."" == Contraindications == Mannitol is contraindicated in people with anuria, severe hypovolemia, pre-existing severe pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and active intracranial bleeding except during craniotomy. Adverse effects include hyponatremia and volume depletion leading to metabolic acidosis. == Chemistry == Mannitol is an isomer of sorbitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2. While similar, the two sugar alcohols have very different sources in nature, melting points, and uses. == Production == Mannitol is classified as a sugar alcohol; that is, it can be derived from a sugar (mannose) by reduction. Other sugar alcohols include xylitol and sorbitol. === Industrial synthesis === Mannitol is commonly produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, the transformation of starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers sorbitol and mannitol. Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase mannitol yields. === Biosyntheses === Mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Fermentation by microorganisms is an alternative to the traditional industrial synthesis. A fructose to mannitol metabolic pathway, known as the mannitol cycle in fungi, has been discovered in a type of red algae (Caloglossa leprieurii), and it is highly possible that other microorganisms employ similar such pathways. A class of lactic acid bacteria, labeled heterofermentive because of their multiple fermentation pathways, convert either three fructose molecules or two fructose and one glucose molecule into two mannitol molecules, and one molecule each of lactic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. Feedstock syrups containing medium to large concentrations of fructose (for example, cashew apple juice, containing 55% fructose: 45% glucose) can produce yields 200 g (7.1 oz) mannitol per liter of feedstock. Further research is being conducted, studying ways to engineer even more efficient mannitol pathways in lactic acid bacteria, as well as the use of other microorganisms such as yeast and E. coli in mannitol production. When food-grade strains of any of the aforementioned microorganisms are used, the mannitol and the organism itself are directly applicable to food products, avoiding the need for careful separation of microorganism and mannitol crystals. Although this is a promising method, steps are needed to scale it up to industrially needed quantities. === Natural extraction === Since mannitol is found in a wide variety of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (Serenoa). Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the Soxhlet extraction, using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another method of extraction is using supercritical and subcritical fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, so are more diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or subcritical fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction – 141.7 g (5.00 oz) CO2 versus 194.4 g (6.86 oz) ethanol per 1 g (0.035 oz) olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, subcritical water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only 4.01 g (0.141 oz) water per 1 g (0.035 oz) of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and subcritical extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction. However, the required high operating temperatures and pressures are causes for hesitancy in the industrial use of this technique. == History == In the early 1880s, Julije Domac elucidated the structure of hexene and mannitol obtained from Caspian manna. He determined the place of the double bond in hexene obtained from mannitol and proved that it is a derivative of a normal hexene. This also solved the structure of mannitol, which was unknown until then. == Controversy == The three studies that originally found high-dose mannitol effective in treating severe head injury were the subject of an investigation. Published in 2007 after the lead author Dr Julio Cruz's death, the investigation questioned whether the studies had actually taken place. The co-authors of the paper were not able to confirm the existence of the study patients, and the Federal University of São Paulo, which Cruz gave as his affiliation, had never employed him. As a result of doubt surrounding Cruz's work, an updated version of the Cochrane review excludes all studies by Julio Cruz, leaving only four studies. Due to differences in selection of control groups, a conclusion about the clinical use of mannitol has not been reached. == Compendial status == British Pharmacopoeia Japanese Pharmacopoeia United States Pharmacopeia == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Mannitol at Wikimedia Commons"	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.005272892, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' FOOD': -1.342522e-05}

7	Hippuric acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Hippuric acid (Gr. hippos, horse, ouron, urine) is a carboxylic acid and organic compound. It is found in urine and is formed from the combination of benzoic acid and glycine. Levels of hippuric acid rise with the consumption of phenolic compounds (such as in fruit juice, tea and wine). The phenols are first converted to benzoic acid, and then to hippuric acid and excreted in urine. Hippuric acid crystallizes in rhombic prisms which are readily soluble in hot water, melt at 187 °C, and decompose at about 240 °C. High concentrations of hippuric acid may also indicate a toluene intoxication; however, scientists have called this correlation into question because there are other variables that affect levels of hippuric acid. When many aromatic compounds such as benzoic acid and toluene are taken internally, they are converted to hippuric acid by reaction with the amino acid, glycine. == Synthesis == A modern synthesis of hippuric acid involves the acylation of glycine with benzoyl chloride (""Schotten–Baumann reaction""). == Physiology == Biochemically, hippuric acid is produced from benzoic acid and glycine, which occurs in the liver, intestine, and kidneys. In terms of mechanism, benzoic acid is converted to benzoyl CoA, an acylating agent. Hippuric acid may be formed from the essential amino acid phenylalanine through at least two pathways. Phenylalanine undergoes biotransformation to form an alpha-keto acid, phenylpyruvic acid, which can tautomerize to a reactive enol. The benzylic carbon is reactive which undergoes peroxidation followed by the competing pathways to either react with the alpha carbon subsequently form an dioxetanol intermediate followed by formation of oxalic acid and benzaldehyde, or, peroxidation can react with the carboxyl group to form an alpha-keto-beta-peroxylactone intermediate followed by formation of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and benzaldehyde. Alternatively, under certain conditions, phenylpyruvic acid may undergo a redox mechanism, such as Iron(II) donating an electron, to directly release carbon dioxide, followed by carbon monoxide, for the formation of a stable toluene radical which is resolved by an antioxidant such as ascorbate. In all of the aforementioned cases, benzaldehyde undergoes biotransformation via CYP450 to benzoic acid followed by conjugation to glycine for formation of hippurate which undergoes urinary excretion. Similarly, toluene reacts with CYP450 to form benzaldehyde. Hippuric acid has been reported to be a marker for Parkinson's disease. == Reactions == Hippuric acid is readily hydrolysed by hot caustic alkalis to benzoic acid and glycine. Nitrous acid converts it into benzoyl glycolic acid, C6H5C(=O)OCH2CO2H. Its ethyl ester reacts with hydrazine to form hippuryl hydrazine, C6H5CONHCH2CONHNH2, which was used by Theodor Curtius for the preparation of hydrazoic acid. == History == Justus von Liebig showed in 1829 that hippuric acid differed from benzoic acid and he named it, and in 1834 he determined its constitution, while in 1853 French chemist Victor Dessaignes (1800–1885) synthesized it by the action of benzoyl chloride on the zinc salt of glycine. It was also formed by heating benzoic anhydride with glycine, and by heating benzamide with monochloroacetic acid. == See also == para-Aminohippuric acid ortho-Iodohippuric acid Methylhippuric acid (three different isomers) == References =="	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': -1.9361265e-07, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
8	Biotin	WIKIPEDIA	"Biotin (also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H) is one of the B vitamins. It is involved in a wide range of metabolic processes, both in humans and in other organisms, primarily related to the utilization of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids. The name biotin, borrowed from the German Biotin, derives from the Ancient Greek word βίοτος (bíotos; 'life') and the suffix ""-in"" (a suffix used in chemistry usually to indicate 'forming'). Biotin appears as a white, needle-like crystalline solid. == Chemical description == Biotin is classified as a heterocyclic compound, with a sulfur-containing tetrahydrothiophene ring fused to a ureido group. A C5-carboxylic acid side chain is appended to the former ring. The ureido ring, containing the −N−CO−N− group, serves as the carbon dioxide carrier in carboxylation reactions. Biotin is a coenzyme for five carboxylase enzymes, which are involved in the catabolism of amino acids and fatty acids, synthesis of fatty acids, and gluconeogenesis. Biotinylation of histone proteins in nuclear chromatin plays a role in chromatin stability and gene expression. == Dietary recommendations == The US National Academy of Medicine updated Dietary Reference Intakes for many vitamins in 1998. At that time there was insufficient information to establish estimated average requirement or recommended dietary allowance, terms that exist for most vitamins. In instances such as this, the academy sets adequate intakes (AIs) with the understanding that at some later date, when the physiological effects of biotin are better understood, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The biotin AIs for both males and females are: Australia and New Zealand set AIs similar to the US. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also identifies AIs, setting values at 40 μg/day for adults, pregnancy at 40 μg/day, and breastfeeding at 45 μg/day. For children ages 1–17 years, the AIs increase with age from 20 to 35 μg/day. === Safety === The US National Academy of Medicine estimates upper limits for vitamins and minerals when evidence for a true limit is sufficient. For biotin, however, there is no upper limit because adverse effects of high biotin intake have not been determined. The EFSA also reviewed safety and reached the same conclusion as in the United States. === Labeling regulations === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value. For biotin labeling purposes, 100% of the daily value was 300 μg/day, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 30 μg/day to bring it into an agreement with the adequate intake. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with US$10 million or more in annual food sales, and by January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with lower volume food sales. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == Biotin is stable at room temperature and is not destroyed by cooking. The dietary biotin intake in Western populations has been estimated to be in the range of 35 to 70 μg/day. Nursing infants ingest about 6 μg/day. Biotin is available in dietary supplements, individually or as an ingredient in multivitamins. According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, biotin deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified. == Physiology == Biotin is a water-soluble B vitamin. Consumption of large amounts as a dietary supplement results in absorption, followed by excretion into urine as biotin. Consumption of biotin as part of a normal diet results in urinary excretion of biotin and biotin metabolites. === Absorption === Biotin in food is bound to proteins. Digestive enzymes reduce the proteins to biotin-bound peptides. The intestinal enzyme biotinidase, found in pancreatic secretions and in the brush border membranes of all three parts of the small intestine, frees biotin, which is then absorbed from the small intestine. When consumed as a biotin dietary supplement, absorption is nonsaturable, meaning that even very high amounts are absorbed effectively. Transport across the jejunum is faster than across the ileum. The large intestine microbiota synthesize amounts of biotin estimated to be similar to the amount taken in the diet, and a significant portion of this biotin exists in the free (protein-unbound) form and, thus, is available for absorption. How much is absorbed in humans is unknown, although a review did report that human epithelial cells of the colon in vitro demonstrated an ability to uptake biotin. Once absorbed, sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) mediates biotin uptake into the liver. SMVT also binds pantothenic acid, so high intakes of either of these vitamins can interfere with transport of the other. === Metabolism and excretion === Biotin catabolism occurs via two pathways. In one, the valeric acid sidechain is cleaved, resulting in bisnorbiotin. In the other pathway, the sulfur is oxidized, resulting in biotin sulfoxide. Urine content is proportionally about half biotin, plus bisnorbiotin, biotin sulfoxide, and small amounts of other metabolites. === Factors that affect biotin requirements === Chronic alcohol use is associated with a significant reduction in plasma biotin. Intestinal biotin uptake also appears to be sensitive to the effect of the anti-epilepsy drugs carbamazepine and primidone. Relatively low levels of biotin have also been reported in the urine or plasma of patients who have had a partial gastrectomy or have other causes of achlorhydria, as well as burn patients, elderly individuals, and athletes. Pregnancy and lactation may be associated with an increased demand for biotin. In pregnancy, this may be due to a possible acceleration of biotin catabolism, whereas, in lactation, the higher demand has yet to be elucidated. Recent studies have shown marginal biotin deficiency can be present in human gestation, as evidenced by increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, decreased urinary excretion of biotin and bisnorbiotin, and decreased plasma concentration of biotin. == Biosynthesis == Biotin, synthesized in plants, is essential to plant growth and development. Bacteria also synthesize biotin, and it is thought that bacteria resident in the large intestine may synthesize biotin that is absorbed and utilized by the host organism. Biosynthesis starts from two precursors, alanine and pimeloyl-CoA. These form 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA). KAPA is transported from plant peroxisomes to mitochondria where it is converted to 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) with the help of the enzyme, BioA. The enzyme dethiobiotin synthetase catalyzes the formation of the ureido ring via a DAPA carbamate activated with ATP, creating dethiobiotin with the help of the enzyme, BioD, which is then converted into biotin which is catalyzed by BioB. The last step is catalyzed by biotin synthase, a radical SAM enzyme. The sulfur is donated by an unusual [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. Depending on the species of bacteria, Biotin can be synthesized via multiple pathways. == Cofactor biochemistry == The enzyme holocarboxylase synthetase covalently attaches biotin to five human carboxylase enzymes: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC1) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta (ACC2) Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) For the first two, biotin serves as a cofactor responsible for transfer of bicarbonate to acetyl-CoA, converting it to malonyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. PC participates in gluconeogenesis. MCC catalyzes a step in leucine metabolism. PCC catalyzes a step in the metabolism of propionyl-CoA. Metabolic degradation of the biotinylated carboxylases leads to the formation of biocytin. This compound is further degraded by biotinidase to release biotin, which is then reutilized by holocarboxylase synthetase. Biotinylation of histone proteins in nuclear chromatin is a posttranslational modification that plays a role in chromatin stability and gene expression. == Deficiency == Primary biotin deficiency, meaning deficiency as a consequence of too little biotin in the diet, is rare, because biotin is contained in so many foods. Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning, brittle fingernails, or skin rash, typically on the face. Aside from inadequate dietary intake (rare), deficiency of biotin can be caused by a genetic disorder that affects biotin metabolism. The most common among these is biotinidase deficiency. Low activity of this enzyme causes a failure to recycle biotin from biocytin. Rarer are carboxylase and biotin transporter deficiences. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency started in the United States in 1984, with many countries now also testing for this genetic disorder at birth. Treatment is lifelong dietary supplement with biotin. If biotinidase deficiency goes untreated, it can be fatal. === Diagnosis === Low serum and urine biotin are not sensitive indicators of inadequate biotin intake. However, serum testing can be useful for confirmation of consumption of biotin-containing dietary supplements, and whether a period of refraining from supplement use is long enough to eliminate the potential for interfering with drug tests. Indirect measures depend on the biotin requirement for carboxylases. 3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA is an intermediate step in the catabolism of the amino acid leucine. In the absence of biotin, the pathway diverts to 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. Urinary excretion of this compound is an early and sensitive indicator of biotin deficiency. === Deficiency as a result of metabolic disorders === Biotinidase deficiency is a deficiency of the enzyme that recycles biotin, the consequence of an inherited genetic mutation. Biotinidase catalyzes the cleavage of biotin from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides (the proteolytic degradation products of each holocarboxylase) and thereby recycles biotin. It is also important in freeing biotin from dietary protein-bound biotin. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency started in the United States in 1984, which as of 2017 was reported as required in more than 30 countries. Profound biotinidase deficiency, defined as less than 10% of normal serum enzyme activity, which has been reported as 7.1 nmol/min/mL, has an incidence of 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 60,000, but with rates as high as 1 in 10,000 in countries with high incidence of consanguineous marriages (second cousin or closer). Partial biotinidase deficiency is defined as 10% to 30% of normal serum activity. Incidence data stems from government mandated newborn screening. For profound deficiency, treatment is oral dosing with 5 to 20 mg per day. Seizures are reported as resolving in hours to days, with other symptoms resolving within weeks. Treatment of partial biotinidase deficiency is also recommended even though some untreated people never manifest symptoms. Lifelong treatment with supplemental biotin is recommended for both profound and partial biotinidase deficiency. Inherited metabolic disorders characterized by deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed multiple carboxylase deficiency. These include deficiencies in the enzymes holocarboxylase synthetase. Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions. There can also be a genetic defect affecting the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter protein. Biochemical and clinical manifestations of any of these metabolic disorders can include ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, rash, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, alopecia and coma. == Use in biotechnology == Chemically modified versions of biotin are widely used throughout the biotechnology industry to isolate proteins and non-protein compounds for biochemical assays. Because egg-derived avidin binds strongly to biotin with a dissociation constant Kd ≈ 10−15 M, biotinylated compounds of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction. First, the chemically modified biotin reagents are bound to the targeted compounds in a solution via a process called biotinylation. The choice of which chemical modification to use is responsible for the biotin reagent binding to a specific protein. Second, the sample is incubated with avidin bound to beads, then rinsed, removing all unbound proteins, while leaving only the biotinylated protein bound to avidin. Last, the biotinylated protein can be eluted from the beads with excess free biotin. The process can also utilize bacteria-derived streptavidin bound to beads, but because it has a higher dissociation constant than avidin, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the biotinylated protein from the beads, which often will denature the protein of interest. == Interference with medical laboratory results == When people are ingesting high levels of biotin in dietary supplements, a consequence can be clinically significant interference with diagnostic blood tests that use biotin-streptavidin technology. This methodology is commonly used to measure levels of hormones such as thyroid hormones, and other analytes such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Biotin interference can produce both falsely normal and falsely abnormal results. In the US, biotin as a non-prescription dietary supplement is sold in amounts of 1 to 10 mg per serving, with claims for supporting hair and nail health, and as 300 mg per day as a possibly effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (see § Research). Overconsumption of 5 mg/day or higher causes elevated concentration in plasma that interferes with biotin-streptavidin immunoassays in an unpredictable manner. Healthcare professionals are advised to instruct patients to stop taking biotin supplements for 48 h or even up to weeks before the test, depending on the specific test, dose, and frequency of biotin uptake. Guidance for laboratory staff is proposed to detect and manage biotin interference. == History == In 1916, W. G. Bateman observed that a diet high in raw egg whites caused toxic symptoms in dogs, cats, rabbits, and humans. By 1927, scientists such as Margarete Boas and Helen Parsons had performed experiments demonstrating the symptoms associated with ""egg-white injury."" They had found that rats fed large amounts of egg-white as their only protein source exhibited neurological dysfunction, hair loss, dermatitis, and eventually, death. In 1936, Fritz Kögl and Benno Tönnis documented isolating a yeast growth factor in a journal article titled ""Darstellung von krystallisiertem biotin aus eigelb."" (Representation of crystallized biotin from egg yolk). The name biotin derives from the Greek word bios ('to live') and the suffix ""-in"" (a general chemical suffix used in organic chemistry). Other research groups, working independently, had isolated the same compound under different names. Hungarian scientist Paul Gyorgy began investigating the factor responsible for egg-white injury in 1933 and in 1939, was successful identifying what he called ""Vitamin H"" (the H represents Haar und Haut, German for 'hair and skin'). Further chemical characterization of vitamin H revealed that it was water-soluble and present in high amounts in the liver. After experiments performed with yeast and Rhizobium trifolii, West and Wilson isolated a compound they called co-enzyme R. By 1940, it was recognized that all three compounds were identical and were collectively given the name: biotin. Gyorgy continued his work on biotin and in 1941 published a paper demonstrating that egg-white injury was caused by the binding of biotin by avidin. Unlike for many vitamins, there is insufficient information to establish a recommended dietary allowance, so dietary guidelines identify an ""adequate intake"" based on best available science with the understanding that at some later date this will be replaced by more exact information. Using E. coli, a biosynthesis pathway was proposed by Rolfe and Eisenberg in 1968. The initial step was described as a condensation of pimelyl-CoA and alanine to form 7-oxo-8-aminopelargonic acid. From there, they described three-step process, the last being introducing a sulfur atom to form the tetrahydrothiophene ring. == Research == === Multiple sclerosis === High-dose biotin (300 mg/day = 10,000 times adequate intake) has been used in clinical trials for treatment of multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating autoimmune disease. The hypothesis is that biotin may promote remyelination of the myelin sheath of nerve cells, slowing or even reversing neurodegeneration. The proposed mechanisms are that biotin activates acetyl-coA carboxylase, which is a key rate-limiting enzyme during the synthesis of myelin, and by reducing axonal hypoxia through enhanced energy production. Clinical trial results are mixed; a 2019 review concluded that a further investigation of the association between multiple sclerosis symptoms and biotin should be undertaken, whereas two 2020 reviews of a larger number of clinical trials reported no consistent evidence for benefits, and some evidence for increased disease activity and higher risk of relapse. === Hair, nails, skin === In the United States, biotin is promoted as a dietary supplement for strengthening hair and fingernails, though scientific data supporting these outcomes in humans are very weak. A review of the fingernails literature reported brittle nail improvement as evidence from two pre-1990 clinical trials that had administered an oral dietary supplement of 2.5 mg/day for several months, without a placebo control comparison group. There is no more recent clinical trial literature. A review of biotin as treatment for hair loss identified case studies of infants and young children with genetic defect biotin deficiency having improved hair growth after supplementation, but went on to report that ""there have been no randomized, controlled trials to prove efficacy of supplementation with biotin in normal, healthy individuals."" Biotin is also incorporated into topical hair and skin products with similar claims. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 states that the US Food and Drug Administration must allow on the product label what are described as ""Structure:Function"" (S:F) health claims that ingredient(s) are essential for health. For example: Biotin helps maintain healthy skin, hair and nails. If a S:F claim is made, the label must include the disclaimer ""This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."" == Animals == In cattle, biotin is necessary for hoof health. Lameness due to hoof problems is common, with herd prevalence estimated at 10 to 35%. Consequences of lameness include less food consumption, lower milk production, and increased veterinary treatment costs. Results after 4–6 months from supplementing biotin at 20 mg/day into daily diet reduces the risk of lameness. A review of controlled trials reported that supplementation at 20 mg/day increased milk yield by 4.8%. The discussion speculated that this could be an indirect consequence of improved hoof health or a direct effect on milk production. For horses, conditions such as chronic laminitis, cracked hooves, or dry, brittle feet incapable of holding shoes are a common problem. Biotin is a popular nutritional supplement. There are recommendations that horses need 15 to 25 mg/day. Studies report biotin improves the growth of new hoof horn rather than improving the status of existing hoof, so months of supplementation are needed for the hoof wall to be completely replaced. == See also == Biotin deficiency Biotin sulfoxide Biotinidase deficiency Biotinylation Multiple carboxylase deficiency NeutrAvidin Photobiotin == References == == External links == Media related to Biotin at Wikimedia Commons"	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	{'FO': -0.005208852, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -0.0014020253, ' PERSON': -0.23154809, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}
9	Kynurenic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Kynurenic acid (KYNA or KYN) is a product of the normal metabolism of amino acid L-tryptophan. It has been shown that kynurenic acid possesses neuroactive activity. It acts as an antiexcitotoxic and anticonvulsant, most likely through acting as an antagonist at excitatory amino acid receptors. Because of this activity, it may influence important neurophysiological and neuropathological processes. As a result, kynurenic acid has been considered for use in therapy in certain neurobiological disorders. Conversely, increased levels of kynurenic acid have also been linked to certain pathological conditions. Kynurenic acid was discovered in 1853 by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in dog urine, which it was apparently named after. It is formed from L-kynurenine in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme kynurenine—oxoglutarate transaminase. == Mechanism of action == KYNA has been proposed to act on five targets: As an antagonist at ionotropic AMPA, NMDA and Kainate glutamate receptors in the concentration range of 0.1-2.5 mM. As a noncompetitive antagonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor. As an antagonist of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, recently (2011) direct recording of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor currents in adult (noncultured) hippocampal interneurons by the Cooper laboratory validated a 2009 study that failed to find any blocking effect of kynurenic acid across a wide range of concentrations, thus suggesting that in noncultured, intact preparations from adult animals there is no effect of kynurenic acid on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor currents. As a ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35. As an agonist for the G protein-coupled receptor HCAR3. == Role in disease == High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in patients with tick-borne encephalitis, schizophrenia and HIV-related illnesses. In all these situations, increased levels were associated with confusion and psychotic symptoms. Kynurenic acid acts in the brain as a glycine-site NMDAr antagonist, key in glutamatergic neurotransmission system, which is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The kynurenic acid hypothesis of schizophrenia was proposed in 2007, based on its action on midbrain dopamine activity and NMDArs, thus linking dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia with the glutamate hypothesis of the disease. Kynurenic acid is reduced in individuals with mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, especially during depressive episodes. High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in human urine in certain metabolic disorders, such as marked pyridoxine deficiency and deficiency/absence of kynureninase. When researchers decreased the levels of kynurenic acid in the brains of mice, their cognition was shown to improve markedly. However, kynurenic acid also shows neuroprotective properties. Some researchers have posited that the increased levels found in cases of neurological degradation is due to a failed attempt to protect the cells. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid compared to kynurenine appear to be associated with poorer T cell response and higher mortality in male subjects with COVID-19, suggesting an explanation for the poorer clinical outcomes observed in males than in females. == Link to ketogenic diet == One controlled study kept mice on a ketogenic diet and measured kynurenic acid concentrations in different parts of the brain. It found that the mice on the ketogenic diet had greater kynurenic acid concentrations in the striatum and hippocampus compared to mice on a normal diet, with no significant difference in the cortex. In response to the studies showing detrimental behaviour following increases in kynurenic acid the authors also note that the diet was generally well tolerated by the animals, with no ""gross behavioural abnormalities"". They posit that the increases in concentrations found were insufficient to produce behavioural changes seen in those studies. == See also == Xanthurenic acid == References == == External links == Link found between TBE and schizophrenia - TheLocal.se, Sweden's news in English, 6 November 2007."

19	Quercetin	WIKIPEDIA	"Quercetin is a plant flavonol from the flavonoid group of polyphenols. It is found in many fruits, vegetables, leaves, seeds, and grains; capers, red onions, and kale are common foods containing appreciable amounts of it. It has a bitter flavor and is used as an ingredient in dietary supplements, beverages, and foods. == Occurrence == Quercetin is a flavonoid widely distributed in nature. The name has been used since 1857, and is derived from quercetum (oak forest), after the oak genus Quercus. It is a naturally occurring polar auxin transport inhibitor. Quercetin is one of the most abundant dietary flavonoids, with an average daily consumption of 25–50 mg. In red onions, higher concentrations of quercetin occur in the outermost rings and in the part closest to the root, the latter being the part of the plant with the highest concentration. One study found that organically grown tomatoes had 79% more quercetin than non-organically grown fruit. Quercetin is present in various kinds of honey from different plant sources. == Biosynthesis == In plants, phenylalanine is converted to 4-coumaroyl-CoA in a series of steps known as the general phenylpropanoid pathway using phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumaroyl-CoA-ligase. One molecule of 4-coumaroyl-CoA is added to three molecules of malonyl-CoA to form tetrahydroxychalcone using 7,2′-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyisoflavanol synthase. Tetrahydroxychalcone is then converted into naringenin using chalcone isomerase. Naringenin is converted into eriodictyol using flavanoid 3′-hydroxylase. Eriodictyol is then converted into dihydroquercetin with flavanone 3-hydroxylase, which is then converted into quercetin using flavonol synthase. === Glycosides === Quercetin is the aglycone form of a number of other flavonoid glycosides, such as rutin (also known as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) and quercitrin, found in citrus fruit, buckwheat, and onions. Quercetin forms the glycosides quercitrin and rutin together with rhamnose and rutinose, respectively. Likewise guaijaverin is the 3-O-arabinoside, hyperoside is the 3-O-galactoside, isoquercitin is the 3-O-glucoside and spiraeoside is the 4′-O-glucoside. CTN-986 is a quercetin derivative found in cottonseeds and cottonseed oil. Miquelianin is the quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside. Several taxifolin (also known as dihydroquercetin) glycosides also exist. Isoquercetin is the 3-O-glucoside of quercetin. === Rutin degradation pathway === The enzyme quercitrinase can be found in Aspergillus flavus. This enzyme hydrolyzes the glycoside quercitrin to release quercetin and L-rhamnose. It is an enzyme in the rutin catabolic pathway. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of quercetin in humans after oral intake is very low, with one study concluding it must be less than 1%. Intravenous injection of quercetin shows a rapid decay in concentration described by a two-compartment model (initial half-life of 8.8 minutes, terminal half-life of 2.4 hours). Because it undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism, the biological effects presumed from in vitro studies are unlikely to apply in vivo. Quercetin supplements in the aglycone form are less bioavailable than the quercetin glycoside often found in foods, especially red onions. Ingestion with high-fat foods may increase bioavailability compared to ingestion with low-fat foods, and carbohydrate-rich foods may increase absorption of quercetin by stimulating gastrointestinal motility and colonic fermentation. Whereas quercetin has been shown to be a potent anti-inflammatory compound in a variety of in vitro and in vivo bioassay models, oral quercetin in human subjects has not exhibited the desired effects. Because of low solubility and poor bioavailability of quercetin, derivatives have been synthesized to overcome these challenges and enhance its biological activity, leading to compounds with improved properties for possible therapeutic applications. === Metabolism === Quercetin is rapidly metabolized (via glucuronidation) after the ingestion of quercetin foods or supplements. Five metabolites (quercetin glucuronides) have been found in human plasma after quercetin ingestion. Taken together, the quercetin glucuronides have a half-life around 11–12 hours. In rats, quercetin did not undergo any significant phase I metabolism. In contrast, quercetin did undergo extensive phase II (conjugation) to produce metabolites that are more polar than the parent substance, hence are more rapidly excreted from the body. In vitro, the meta-hydroxyl group of catechol is methylated by catechol-O-methyltransferase. Four of the five hydroxyl groups of quercetin are glucuronidated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The exception is the 5-hydroxyl group of the flavonoid ring, which generally does not undergo glucuronidation. The major metabolites of orally absorbed quercetin are quercetin-3-glucuronide, 3'-methylquercetin-3-glucuronide, and quercetin-3'-sulfate. A methyl metabolite of quercetin has been shown in vitro to be more effective than quercetin at inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages. Compared to other flavonoids, quercetin is one of the most effective inducers of the phase II detoxification enzymes. In vitro studies show that quercetin is a strong inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Drugs that are metabolized by these pathways may have increased effect. An in vivo study found that quercetin supplementation slows the metabolism of caffeine to a statistically significant extent in a particular genetic subpopulation, but in absolute terms the effect was almost negligible. == Food safety == In 2010, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration acknowledged high-purity quercetin as generally recognized as safe for use as an ingredient in various specified food categories at levels up to 500 mg per serving. == Health claims == Quercetin has been studied in basic research and small clinical trials. While supplements have been promoted for the treatment of cancer and various other diseases, there is no high-quality evidence that quercetin (via supplements or in food) is useful to treat cancer or any other disease. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to several manufacturers advertising on their product labels and websites that quercetin product(s) can be used to treat diseases. The FDA regards such quercetin advertising and products as unapproved – with unauthorized health claims concerning the anti-disease products – as defined by ""sections 201(g)(1)(B) and/or 201 (g)(1)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B) and/or 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease"", conditions not met by the manufacturers. === Safety === Little research has been conducted into the safety of quercetin supplementation in humans, and the results are insufficient to give confidence that the practice is safe. In particular, a lack of safety information exists on the effect of quercetin supplementation for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, children, and adolescents. The hormonal effects of quercetin found in animal studies raise the suspicion of a parallel effect in humans, particularly in respect of estrogen-dependent tumors. Quercetin supplementation can interfere with the effects of medications. The precise nature of this interaction is known for some common medicines, but for many, it is not. == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Quercetin at Wikimedia Commons"	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -0.00020044109, 'OD': 0.0}
20	Vinpocetine	WIKIPEDIA	"Vinpocetine (ethyl apovincaminate) is a synthetic derivative of the vinca alkaloid vincamine, differing by the removal of a hydroxyl group and by being the ethyl rather than the methyl ester of the underlying carboxylic acid. Vincamine is extracted from either the seeds of Voacanga africana or the leaves of Vinca minor (lesser periwinkle). == Medical uses == Vinpocetine has been used in many Asian and European countries for treatment of cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke and dementia for over three decades. The FDA has tentatively ruled that vinpocetine, due to its synthetic nature and proposed therapeutic uses, is ineligible to be marketed as dietary supplement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Despite this, vinpocetine remains widely available in dietary supplements often marketed as nootropics. Vinpocetine does not fully support a benefit in either dementia or stroke. As of 2003, three controlled clinical trials had tested ""older adults with memory problems"". Vinpocetine has also been studied for the prevention and recovery of acquired hearing loss in a phase II, longitudinal and prospective open clinical study on humans. == Side effects == Use during pregnancy may harm the baby or result in miscarriage. Adverse effects of vinpocetine include flushing, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, transient hypo- and hyper-tension, headaches, heartburn, and decreased blood pressure. FDA issued a statement in 2019 warning that ""vinpocetine may cause a miscarriage or harm fetal development"". == Mechanism of action == Vinpocetine’s mechanism of action has been postulated to involve three potential effects: blockage of sodium channels, reduction of cellular calcium influx, and antioxidant activity. Studies have also suggested that vinpocetine can inhibit PDE-1 in isolated rabbit aorta; inhibit IKK in vitro, preventing IκB degradation and the following translocation of NF-κB to the cell nucleus; and increase DOPAC, a metabolic breakdown product of dopamine, in isolated striatal nerve endings of rats. == Dietary supplement == The inclusion of vinpocetine in dietary supplements in the U.S. has come under scrutiny due to the lack of defined dosage parameters, unproven short- and long-term benefits, and risks to human health. In the U.S., vinpocetine supplements are marketed as sports supplements, brain enhancers, and weight loss supplements. A 2015 analysis of 23 brands of vinpocetine dietary supplements sold at GNC and Vitamin Shoppe retail stores reported widespread labeling errors. Only 6 of the 23 supplement labels (26%) provided consumers with accurate dosages of vinpocetine (ranging from 0.3 to 32 mg per recommended daily serving), while 6 of 23 (26%) contained no vinpocetine at all, despite their labels claiming that the ingredient was in them. In total, 9 of the 23 products tested were mislabeled, and 17 of 23 (74%) did not provide any information on the quantity of vinpocetine. In response to the study, then-senator Claire McCaskill, while at the time serving as the top Democrat on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, urged the FDA to suspend sales of vinpocetine supplements and asked 10 retailers to voluntarily stop selling vinpocetine products. McCaskill stated: ""The way we regulate these supplements isn’t working—and it’s putting the lives and well-being of consumers at risk. We’ve seen products with false labels, tainted ingredients, wildly illegal claims, and, now, products containing synthesized ingredients that are classified as prescription drugs in other countries."" === Lawsuits === Procera AVH is a dietary supplement containing undisclosed amounts of vinpocetine in combination with huperzine A and acetyl-l-carnitine. In 2012, manufacturer Brain Research Labs (BRL) agreed to pay $500,000 to settle a class action lawsuit which alleged that the company had falsely marketed Procera AVH as capable of improving brain function, in violation of the Consumer Fraud Act. In July 2015, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled that marketing claims for Procera AVH, which promoted the product as a “solution” to memory loss and cognitive decline, were false, misleading, unsubstantiated, and in violation of the FTC Act. BRL and its affiliated companies Brain Power Partners, Brain Power Founders, and MedHealth Direct (all based in Laguna Beach, California) were fined $91 million. KeyView Labs, the Tampa, Florida-based company that purchased BRL in 2012, was fined $61 million. Also named in the FTC complaint were George Reynolds (aka Josh Reynolds), founder and chief science officer of BRL, and John Arnold, the sole officer and employee of MedHealth. The FTC complaint charged Reynolds with making deceptive expert endorsements for Procera AVH. The defendants in the case ultimately agreed to pay $1.4 million to settle the allegations of deceptive advertising brought by the FTC and California law enforcement officials. In addition, a permanent injunction barred the defendants from making similar deceptive claims about Procera AVH in the future and from misrepresenting the existence, results, or conclusions of any scientific study. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
23	Lovastatin	WIKIPEDIA	Lovastatin, sold under the brand name Mevacor among others, is a statin medication, to treat high blood cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Its use is recommended together with lifestyle changes. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation, headache, muscles pains, rash, and trouble sleeping. Serious side effects may include liver problems, muscle breakdown, and kidney failure. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby and use during breastfeeding is not recommended. It works by decreasing the liver's ability to produce cholesterol by blocking the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Lovastatin was patented in 1979 and approved for medical use in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 111th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == The primary uses of lovastatin is for the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels. == Side effects == Lovastatin is usually well tolerated, with the most common side effects being, in approximately descending order of frequency: creatine phosphokinase elevation, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, muscle aches or pains, nausea, indigestion, weakness, blurred vision, rash, dizziness and muscle cramps. As with all statin drugs, it can occasionally cause myopathy, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), dermatomyositis or rhabdomyolysis. This can be life-threatening if not recognised and treated in time, so any unexplained muscle pain or weakness whilst on lovastatin should be promptly mentioned to the prescribing doctor. Other uncommon side effects that should be promptly mentioned to either the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service include: These less serious side effects should still be reported if they persist or increase in severity: === Contraindications === Contraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with lovastatin, include pregnancy, breast feeding, and liver disease. Lovastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X); it may cause birth defects such as skeletal deformities or learning disabilities. Owing to its potential to disrupt infant lipid metabolism, lovastatin should not be taken while breastfeeding. Patients with liver disease should not take lovastatin. == Interactions == As with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and other statin drugs metabolized via CYP3A4, drinking grapefruit juice during lovastatin therapy may increase the risk of side effects. Components of grapefruit juice, the flavonoid naringin, or the furanocoumarin bergamottin inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro, and may account for the in vivo effect of grapefruit juice concentrate decreasing the metabolic clearance of lovastatin, and increasing its plasma concentrations. == Mechanism of action == Lovastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Mevalonate is a required building block for cholesterol biosynthesis and lovastatin interferes with its production by acting as a reversible competitive inhibitor for HMG-CoA, which binds to the HMG-CoA reductase. Lovastatin is a prodrug, an inactive lactone in its native form, the gamma-lactone closed ring form in which it is administered, is hydrolysed in vivo to the β-hydroxy acid open ring form; which is the active form. Lovastatin and other statins have been studied for their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects. No such effects were seen in the early studies. More recent investigations revealed some chemopreventive and therapeutic effects, for certain types of cancer, especially in combination of statins with other anticancer drugs. It is likely that these effect are mediated by the properties of statins to reduce proteasome activity, leading to an accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27, and to subsequent G1-phase arrest, as seen in cells of different cancer lines. == History == Compactin and lovastatin, natural products with a powerful inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase, were discovered in the 1970s, and taken into clinical development as potential drugs for lowering LDL cholesterol. In 1982, some small-scale clinical investigations of lovastatin, a polyketide-derived natural product isolated from Aspergillus terreus, in very high-risk patients were undertaken, in which dramatic reductions in LDL cholesterol were observed, with very few adverse effects. After the additional animal safety studies with lovastatin revealed no toxicity of the type thought to be associated with compactin, clinical studies continued. Large-scale trials confirmed the effectiveness of lovastatin. Observed tolerability continued to be excellent, and lovastatin was approved by the US FDA in 1987. It was the first statin approved by the FDA. Lovastatin is also naturally produced by certain higher fungi, such as Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) and closely related Pleurotus spp. Research into the effect of oyster mushroom and its extracts on the cholesterol levels of laboratory animals has been extensive, although the effect has been demonstrated in a very limited number of human subjects. In 1998, the FDA placed a ban on the sale of dietary supplements derived from red yeast rice, which naturally contains lovastatin, arguing that products containing prescription agents require drug approval. Judge Dale A. Kimball of the United States District Court for the District of Utah, granted a motion by Cholestin's manufacturer, Pharmanex, that the agency's ban was illegal under the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act because the product was marketed as a dietary supplement, not a drug. The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the isoprenes that are building-blocks of squalene, the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is at the level of the microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years. HMG CoA reductase occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway and is among the first committed steps to cholesterol formulation. Inhibition of this enzyme could lead to accumulation of HMG CoA, a water-soluble intermediate that is, then, capable of being readily metabolized to simpler molecules. This inhibition of reductase would lead to accumulation of lipophylic intermediates with a formal sterol ring. Lovastatin was the first specific inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase to receive approval for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The first breakthrough in efforts to find a potent, specific, competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase occurred in 1976, when Endo et al. reported the discovery of mevastatin, a highly functionalized fungal metabolite, isolated from cultures of Penicillium citrium. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of lovastatin occurs via an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway. The six genes that encode enzymes that are essential for the biosynthesis of lovastatin are lovB, lovC, lovA, lovD, lovG, and lovF . The synthesis of dihydromonacolin L requires a total of 9-malonyl Coa . It proceeds in the PKS pathway until it reaches (E) a hexaketide, where it undergoes a Diels-Alder cycloaddition to form the fused rings. After cyclization it continues through the PKS pathway until it reaches (I) a nonaketide, which then undergoes release from LovB through the thioesterase encoded by LovG. Dihydromonacolin L, (J), then undergoes oxidation and dehydration via a cytochrome P450 oxygenase encoded by LovA to obtain monacolin J, (L). The MT domain from lovB is active in the conversion of (B) to (C) when it transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to the tetraketide (C) . Because LovB contains an inactive ER domain, LovC is required at specific steps to obtain fully reduced products. The domain organization of LovB, LovC, LovG and LovF is shown in Figure 2. The inactive ER domain of lovB is shown with an oval and where LovC acts in trans to LovB is shown with a red box. In a parallel pathway, the diketide side chain of lovastatin is synthesized by another highly reducing type I polyketide synthase enzyme encoded by LovF . Lastly, the side chain, 2-methylbutyrate (M) is covalently attached to C-8 hydroxy group of monacolin J (L) by a transesterase encoded by LovD to form lovastatin. === Total synthesis === A major bulk of work in the synthesis of lovastatin was done by M. Hirama in the 1980s. Hirama synthesized compactin and used one of the intermediates to follow a different path to get to lovastatin. The synthetic sequence is shown in the schemes below. The γ-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in methanol and then silylation to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the silyl ether. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with Ac2O and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined using 1.3 eq sodium hydride in THF followed by reflux in chlorobenzene for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3. Simple organic reactions were used to get to lovastatin as shown in the scheme. == Society and culture == === Natural sources === Lovastatin is a naturally occurring compound found in low concentrations in food such as oyster mushrooms, red yeast rice, and Pu-erh. === Brand names === Mevacor, Advicor (as a combination with niacin), Altocor, Altoprev === Other applications === In plant physiology, lovastatin has occasionally been used as inhibitor of cytokinin biosynthesis. == References ==	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -1.2590794e-05, ' FOOD': -1.640531e-05}
38	Tetrahydropiperine	PUBMED	 Ischemic stroke (IS) is a life-threatening neurological disease with various pathological mechanisms. Tetrahydropiperine (THP) is a natural alkaloid with protective effects against multiple diseases, such as seizure, and pain. This study was to examine the impact of THP on IS and investigate its potential mechanism. We employed network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques to identify the target proteins of THP for intervention in IS. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to create a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model. PC-12 cells were chosen to establish an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) cell model. Disease modeling followed by nimodipine (NIMO); 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and rapamycin (RAP) interventions. Open field test, Longa score, balance beam test, and forelimb grip test were used to measure motor and neurological functions. The degree of neurological damage recovery was assessed through behavioral analysis, and cerebral infarction volume was determined using TTC staining. Morphological changes were examined through HE and Nissl staining, and ultrastructural changes in neurons were observed using transmission electron microscopy. The protein expression of autophagy and related pathways was analyzed through Western blot (WB). The appropriate hypoxia time and drug concentration were determined using CCK-8 assay, which also measured cell survival rate. The network pharmacology findings indicated that the impact of THP on IS was enhanced in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. THP demonstrated robust docking capability with proteins associated with the autophagy and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, as indicated by the molecular docking outcomes. THP significantly improved behavioral damage, reduced the area of cerebral infarction, ameliorated histopathological damage from ischemia, increase neuronal survival, and alleviated ultrastructural damage in neurons (P < 0.05). THP enhanced the survival of PC-12 cells induced by OGD and ameliorated the morphological harm to the cells (P < 0.05). THP was found to elevate the quantities of P62, LC3-Ⅰ, PI3K, P-AKt/Akt, and P-mTOR/mTOR proteins while reducing the levels of Atg7 and Beclin1 proteins. The results of transmission electron microscopy showed no autophagosomes in the THP, 3-MA, and 3-MA + THP groups. The activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by THP inhibits autophagy and provides relief from neurological damage in IS. The present study describes the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of tetrahydropiperine (THP), piperic acid (PA), and tetrahydropiperic acid (THPA) as anti-inflammatory agents. THPA demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory activity among all the compounds. The anti-inflammatory potential was investigated in both in-vitro and in-vivo experimental models. Our findings demonstrated that THPA effectively suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, THPA attenuated the expression of i-NOS and COX-2 in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The oral administration of THPA significantly reduced carrageenan induced paw edema thickness and alleviated liver, lung, and kidney injury induced by LPS. THPA also reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells, prevented the occurrence of significant lesions, and mitigated tissue damage. Moreover, THPA significantly improved the survival rate of mice challenged with LPS. Our western blot studies also found that LPS induced NF-κB activation was downregulated by treatment with THPA in an in vivo system. These results collectively illustrated the potential of THPA as a therapeutic agent for treating inflammatory diseases.	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.1517355, 'ICAL': 0.0}
39	Piperyline	PUBMED	 Amide alkaloidsare typical constituents in plants of the Piperaceae family. Most of the pharmacological properties of Piper nigrum L. are attributed to the major amide alkaloid, piperine. Piperyline (PIPE) is a further amide alkaloid that has been isolated from P. nigrum. This study was performed to examine the biological effects of PIPE on pre-osteoblasts and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We investigated the effects of PIPE in MC3T3E-1 cells, which are widely used for studying osteoblast behavior in in vitro cell systems. We evaluated cell viability based on the MTT assay, apoptosis by TUNEL staining, adhesion and migration by cell adhesion and migration assays, and osteoblast differentiation by alkaline phosphatase activity and staining. Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses were used to investigate cell signaling pathways. We found that at concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 μM, PIPE inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in pre-osteoblasts, which was accompanied by the upregulation of apoptotic proteins but downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. In contrast, PIPE had no appreciable effect on the autophagy pathway. Nevertheless, PIPE reduced cell adhesion and migration via the inactivation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Src)/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases, and also promoted the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 levels. Furthermore, at concentrations of 10 and 30 μM, PIPE suppressed osteoblast differentiation, as indicated by reductions in alkaline phosphatase staining and activity. In addition, PIPE reduced the protein levels of phospho-Smad1/5/8 and runt-related transcription factor 2, and the mRNA levels of osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin. The findings of this study indicate that PIPE has biological effects associated with cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and osteoblast differentiation, and suggest a potential role for this alkaloid in the treatment of bone diseases.

42	Fosinopril	WIKIPEDIA	Fosinopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used for the treatment of hypertension and some types of chronic heart failure. Fosinopril is the only phosphonate-containing ACE inhibitor marketed, by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the trade name Monopril. Fosinopril is a cascading pro-drug. The special niche for the medication that differentiates it from the other members of the ACE Inhibitor drug class is that was specifically developed for the use for patients with renal impairment. This was through manipulation of the metabolism and excretion, and is seen that fifty percent of the drug is hepatobiliary cleared, which can compensate for diminished renal clearance. The remaining fifty percent is excreted in urine. It does not need dose adjustment. It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1991. == Medical uses == In congestive heart failure, the ability of the heart to pump enough blood to satisfy the physiological needs of the body is reduced. This condition has a variety of causes, including damaged heart valves, myocardial infarction, hypertension, vitamin B1 deficiency, and genetic mutations. When subsequent blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidneys respond by increasing the secretion of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Renin converts the inactive angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II (AII) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). AII can have negative effects on the cardiovascular system after events such as heart failure and myocardial infarction. AII causes arterial vasoconstriction and hypertension, resulting in an increase in afterload, increasing the resistance against which the heart works. Additionally, chronic increase in production of AII is associated with structural changes to the myocardium which reduces the functionality of the heart. In heart failure patients, fosinopril increases exercise tolerance and lowers the frequency of events associated with worsening heart failure, such as dyspnea, the need for supplemental diuretics, fatigue, and hospitalizations. == Chemistry == Unlike other ACE inhibitors that are primarily excreted by the kidneys, fosinopril is eliminated from the body by both renal and hepatic pathways. This characteristic of fosinopril makes the drug a safer choice than other ACE inhibitors for heart failure patients with impaired kidney function resulting from poor perfusion as fosinopril can still be eliminated by the liver, preventing accumulation of the drug in the body. Fosinopril is de-esterified by the liver or gastrointestinal mucosa and is converted to its active form, fosinoprilat. Fosinoprilat competitively binds to ACE, preventing ACE from binding to and converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibiting the production of AII lowers peripheral vascular resistance, decreases afterload, and decreases blood pressure, thus helping to alleviate the negative effects of AII on cardiac performance. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07}
46	Pipernonaline	PUBMED	 The antiproliferation effects of pipernonaline, a piperine derivative, were investigated on human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. It inhibited growth of androgen independent PC-3 and androgen dependent LNCaP prostate cells in a dose-dependent (30-90 μM) and time-dependent (24-48 h) manner. The growth inhibition of PC-3 cells was associated with sub-G(1) and G(0)/G(1) accumulation, confirmed by the down-regulation of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, which are correlated with G(1) phase of cell cycle. Pipernonaline up-regulated cleavage of procaspase-3/PARP, but did not change expression of proapoptotic bax and antiapoptotic bcl-2 proteins. Its caspase-3 activation was confirmed by the caspase-3 assay kit. In addition, pipernonaline caused the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increase of intracellular Ca(2+), and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which these phenomena were reversed by N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger. The results suggest that pipernonaline exhibits apoptotic properties through ROS production, which causes disruption of mitochondrial function and Ca(2+) homeostasis and leads to its downstream events including activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP in PC-3 cells. This is the first report of pipernonaline toward the anticancer activity of prostate cancer cells, which provides a role for candidate agent as well as the molecular basis for human prostate cancer. Pipernonaline (1), one of the components of the spice pepper, preferentially reduced the survival of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells under nutrient-deprived conditions witha PC A methanol extract of Piper longum fruit was found to be active against mosquito larvae of Culex pipiens pallens at 10 microg/ml after 24 h. A piperidine alkaloid, pipernonaline, was found to be responsible for this activity, with the 24-h median lethal dose (LD50) value for this compound being 0.21 mg/liter. The LD50 value of pipernonaline was not much higher than those for the 3 organophosphorous insecticides malathion, chlorpyrifos-methyl, and pirimiphos-methyl, used for comparative purpose in this study. Structural elucidation of pipernonaline was by means of mass spectrometry (1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance imaging).

47	Piperine	WIKIPEDIA	"Piperine, possibly along with its isomer chavicine, is the compound responsible for the pungency of black pepper and long pepper. It has been used in some forms of traditional medicine. == Preparation == Due to its poor solubility in water, piperine is typically extracted from black pepper by using organic solvents like dichloromethane. The amount of piperine varies from 1–2% in long pepper, to 5–10% in commercial white and black peppers. Piperine can also be prepared by treating the solvent-free residue from a concentrated alcoholic extract of black pepper with a solution of potassium hydroxide to remove resin (said to contain chavicine, an isomer of piperine). The solution is decanted from the insoluble residue and left to stand overnight in alcohol. During this period, the alkaloid slowly crystallizes from the solution. Piperine has been synthesized by the action of piperonoyl chloride on piperidine. == Reactions == Piperine forms salts only with strong acids. The platinichloride B4·H2PtCl6 forms orange-red needles (""B"" denotes one mole of the alkaloid base in this and the following formula). Iodine in potassium iodide added to an alcoholic solution of the base in the presence of a little hydrochloric acid gives a characteristic periodide, B2·HI·I2, crystallizing in steel-blue needles with melting point 145 °C. Piperine can be hydrolyzed by an alkali into piperidine and piperic acid. In light, especially ultraviolet light, piperine is changed into its isomers chavicine, isochavicine and isopiperine, which are tasteless. == History == Piperine was discovered in 1819 by Hans Christian Ørsted, who isolated it from the fruits of Piper nigrum, the source plant of both black and white pepper. Piperine was also found in Piper longum and Piper officinarum (Miq.) C. DC. (=Piper retrofractum Vahl), two species called ""long pepper"". == See also == Piperidine, a cyclic six-membered amine that results from hydrolysis of piperine Piperic acid, the carboxylic acid also derived from hydrolysis of piperine Capsaicin, the active piquant chemical in chili peppers Allyl isothiocyanate, the active piquant chemical in mustard, radishes, horseradish, and wasabi Allicin, the active piquant flavor chemical in raw garlic and onions (see those articles for discussion of other chemicals in them relating to pungency, and eye irritation) Ilepcimide Piperlongumine == References =="	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD, MEDICAL	{'FO': -0.0011873724, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -0.011994229, ' MED': -0.0005879411, 'ICAL': 0.0}
51	Tryptophylglycine	PUBMED	 To investigate the mechanism of structural changes of a peptide nanotube and water confined inside the channel, the helical peptide tryptophylglycine monohydrate (WG.H2O) was studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the three-dimension parallel MD program ddgmq (software package) and a consistent force field. Simulations were performed on both the water-containing system and a model system without water molecules. The details of the structural behavior with temperature are investigated for the entire simulated temperature range. Phase transitions were obtained at 115, 245, 270, 310, and 385 K, due to the contributions of both the peptide and the confined water subsystems. The crystalline, amorphous, liquidlike, liquid, and superheated phases of water were observed in the temperature ranges 40-115, 115-245, 245-310, 310-385, and >385 K, respectively. At 300 K, the diffusion constant of the confined water is 0.46 x 10-5 cm2 s-1, a value comparable to that of other peptide nanotubes. The empty peptide system melts at 440 K. Mechanisms of the negative thermal expansion (NTE) along the tube axis were investigated for different temperature ranges. The contraction of the crystalline water (or amorphous water) draws also the tube walls in and leads to NTE below 245 K. The other NTEs appear to be connected to the collapse of the ice network or the solid peptide network between 245 K and room temperature or from 310 to 440 K, respectively. The ACTH/MSH cells of the pars distalis and pars intermedia of the mammalian hypophysis contain peptides with amino-terminal tryptophan which exhibit a strong fluorescence after treatment with modified formaldehyde vapour methods and with glyoxylic acid in the tissue sections from freeze-dried specimens. By homogenization of the hypophyses in ethanolic glyoxylic acid and subsequent heating the peptides can be converted to highly fluorescent beta-carboline derivatives; these can then be extracted with glacial acetic acid, separated by silica gel thin-layer chromatography and identified in UV light. Amino-terminal tryptophyl peptide from adult human hypophysis extracted and treated in this way gave the structure L-tryptophylglycine after acid hydrolysis. This structure was subsequently confirmed by producing a fluorescent derivative from authentic L-tryptophylglycine using the same reaction conditions as for the tissue homogenate. This derivative moved in the same way in thin-layer chromatography as fluorecent amino-terminal tryptophyl peptide extracted from human hypophysis. Thereafter a study was made of the antinociceptive effects of authentic L-tryptophylglycine administered subcutaneously in mice both alone and together with morphine. L-tryptophylglycine had no antinociceptive effects alone and neither did it change morphine antinociception. Also it had no apparent effects on the behaviour of mice. Thus, ACTH/MSH cells contain a dipeptide whose physiological function differs from the effects of ACTH, MSH and endorphins.

54	Nicotinamide	WIKIPEDIA	Nicotinamide (INN, BAN UK) or niacinamide (USAN US) is a form of vitamin B3 found in food and used as a dietary supplement and medication. As a supplement, it is used orally (swallowed by mouth) to prevent and treat pellagra (niacin deficiency). While nicotinic acid (niacin) may be used for this purpose, nicotinamide has the benefit of not causing skin flushing. As a cream, it is used to treat acne, and has been observed in clinical studies to improve the appearance of aging skin by reducing hyperpigmentation and redness. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Side effects are minimal. At high doses, liver problems may occur. Normal amounts are safe for use during pregnancy. Nicotinamide is in the vitamin B family of medications, specifically the vitamin B3 complex. It is an amide of nicotinic acid. Foods that contain nicotinamide include yeast, meat, milk, and green vegetables. Nicotinamide was discovered between 1935 and 1937. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Nicotinamide is available as a generic medication and over the counter. Commercially, nicotinamide is made from either nicotinic acid (niacin) or nicotinonitrile. In some countries, grains have nicotinamide added to them. == Medical uses == === Niacin deficiency === Nicotinamide is the preferred treatment for pellagra, caused by niacin deficiency. === Acne === Nicotinamide cream is used as a treatment for acne. It has anti-inflammatory actions, which may benefit people with inflammatory skin conditions. Nicotinamide increases the biosynthesis of ceramides in human keratinocytes in vitro and improves the epidermal permeability barrier in vivo. The application of 2% topical nicotinamide for 2 and 4 weeks has been found to be effective in lowering the sebum excretion rate. Nicotinamide has been shown to prevent Cutibacterium acnes-induced activation of toll-like receptor 2, which ultimately results in the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory interleukin-8 production. === Skin cancer === Nicotinamide at doses of 500 to 1000 mg a day decreases the risk of skin cancers, other than melanoma, in those at high risk. == Side effects == Nicotinamide has minimal side effects. At very high doses above 3g/ day acute liver toxicity has been documented in at least one case. Normal doses are safe during pregnancy. == Chemistry == The structure of nicotinamide consists of a pyridine ring to which a primary amide group is attached in the meta position. It is an amide of nicotinic acid. As an aromatic compound, it undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions and transformations of its two functional groups. Examples of these reactions reported in Organic Syntheses include the preparation of 2-chloronicotinonitrile by a two-step process via the N-oxide, from nicotinonitrile by reaction with phosphorus pentoxide, and from 3-aminopyridine by reaction with a solution of sodium hypobromite, prepared in situ from bromine and sodium hydroxide. === Industrial production === The hydrolysis of nicotinonitrile is catalysed by the enzyme nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1, producing 3500 tons per annum of nicotinamide for use in animal feed. The enzyme allows for a more selective synthesis as further hydrolysis of the amide to nicotinic acid is avoided. Nicotinamide can also be made from nicotinic acid. According to Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, worldwide 31,000 tons of nicotinamide were sold in 2014. === Biochemistry === Nicotinamide, as a part of the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH / NAD+) is crucial to life. In cells, nicotinamide is incorporated into NAD+ and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). NAD+ and NADP+ are cofactors in a wide variety of enzymatic oxidation-reduction reactions, most notably glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. If humans ingest nicotinamide, it will likely undergo a series of reactions that transform it into NAD, which can then undergo a transformation to form NADP+. This method of creation of NAD+ is called a salvage pathway. However, the human body can produce NAD+ from the amino acid tryptophan and niacin without our ingestion of nicotinamide. NAD+ acts as an electron carrier that mediates the interconversion of energy between nutrients and the cell's energy currency, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In oxidation-reduction reactions, the active part of the cofactor is the nicotinamide. In NAD+, the nitrogen in the aromatic nicotinamide ring is covalently bonded to adenine dinucleotide. The formal charge on the nitrogen is stabilized by the shared electrons of the other carbon atoms in the aromatic ring. When a hydride atom is added onto NAD+ to form NADH, the molecule loses its aromaticity, and therefore a good amount of stability. This higher energy product later releases its energy with the release of a hydride, and in the case of the electron transport chain, it assists in forming adenosine triphosphate. When one mole of NADH is oxidized, 158.2 kJ of energy will be released. === Biological role === Nicotinamide occurs as a component of a variety of biological systems, including within the vitamin B family and specifically the vitamin B3 complex. It is also a critically important part of the structures of NADH and NAD+, where the N-substituted aromatic ring in the oxidised NAD+ form undergoes reduction with hydride attack to form NADH. The NADPH/NADP+ structures have the same ring, and are involved in similar biochemical reactions. Nicotinamide can be methylated in the liver to biologically active 1-Methylnicotinamide when there are sufficient methyl donors. == Food sources == Nicotinamide occurs in trace amounts mainly in meat, fish, nuts, and mushrooms, as well as to a lesser extent in some vegetables. It is commonly added to cereals and other foods. Many multivitamins contain 20–30 mg of vitamin B3 and it is also available in higher doses. == Compendial status == British Pharmacopoeia Japanese Pharmacopoeia == Research == A 2015 trial found nicotinamide to reduce the rate of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in a group of people at high risk for the conditions. Nicotinamide has been investigated for many additional disorders, including treatment of bullous pemphigoid nonmelanoma skin cancers. Nicotinamide may be beneficial in treating psoriasis. There is tentative evidence for a potential role of nicotinamide in treating acne, rosacea, autoimmune blistering disorders, ageing skin, and atopic dermatitis. Nicotinamide also inhibits poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP-1), enzymes involved in the rejoining of DNA strand breaks induced by radiation or chemotherapy. ARCON (accelerated radiotherapy plus carbogen inhalation and nicotinamide) has been studied in cancer. Research has suggested nicotinamide may play a role in the treatment of HIV. == References ==	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	{'MED': -0.0024873111, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -6.098748e-05, ' FOOD': -0.012314793, ' PERSON': -0.0005435001, 'AL': -1.7432603e-06, ' CARE': 0.0}
55	Telmisartan	WIKIPEDIA	Telmisartan, sold under the brand name Micardis among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, and back pain. Serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Telmisartan was patented in 1991 and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 228th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. It is available in combination with hydrochlorothiazide as telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide; with cilnidipine as telmisartan/cilnidipine; and with amlodipine as telmisartan/amlodipine. == Medical uses == Telmisartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure.: 146 == Contraindications == Telmisartan is contraindicated during pregnancy. Telmisartan affects the renin–angiotensin system and can cause birth defects, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths. It is not known whether the medication passes into breast milk. == Side effects == Side effects include tachycardia and bradycardia (fast or slow heartbeat), hypotension (low blood pressure) and edema (swelling of arms, legs, lips, tongue, or throat, the latter leading to breathing problems). Allergic reactions may also occur. == Interactions == Due to its mechanism of action, telmisartan increases blood potassium levels. Combination with potassium preparations or potassium-sparing diuretics could cause hyperkalaemia (excessive potassium levels). Combination with NSAIDs, especially in patients with impaired kidney function, has a risk of causing (usually reversible) kidney failure. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker that shows high affinity for the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1), with a binding affinity 3000 times greater for AT1 than AT2. In addition to blocking the renin–angiotensin system, telmisartan acts as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), a central regulator of insulin and glucose metabolism. It is believed that telmisartan's dual mode of action may provide protective benefits against the vascular and renal damage caused by diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).: 171 As a partial agonist, it activates the receptor by 25–30%. Clinical trials have shown that telmisartan increases insulin sensitivity, reduces cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, and improves endothilial function; all these effects can be attributed to its activity on PPAR-γ. The kidney-protecting activity of telmisartan is attributed to both angiotensin II antagonism and improved endothelial function from PPAR-γ. Telmisartan's activity at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-δ) receptor has prompted speculation around its potential as a sport doping agent as an alternative to GW 501516. Telmisartan activates PPAR-δ receptors in several tissues. In mice, this results in effects such as enhanced endurance. However, telmisartan does not improve the walking performance (6-minute walk distance) in people with lower extremity peripheral artery disease. Telmisartan activates PPAR-α in vitro. === Pharmacokinetics === The substance is quickly but to varying degrees absorbed from the gut. The average bioavailability is about 50% (42–100%). Food intake has no clinically relevant influence on the kinetics of telmisartan. Plasma protein binding is over 99.5%, mainly to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. It has the longest half-life of any angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (24 hours) and the largest volume of distribution among ARBs (500 liters). Less than 3% of telmisartan is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver, and over 97% is eliminated in unchanged form via bile and faeces. == History == == Society and culture == Telmisartan is available as a generic medication. == Research == Telmisartan does not appear effective for slowing the growth of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Telmisartan does not cause rapid cancer growth like the PPAR-δ agonist GW 501516, but whether it causes a change in cancer rates is disputed. Short-term use is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer over other ARB drugs, according to a large 2016 analysis of UK patients. A 2022 meta-analysis finds that a longer duration of taking ARBs (including telmisartan) is associated with an increase in cancer rates. Patients who have taken an ARB for more than 3 years appears 11% more likely to develop cancer. A 2023 large-scale study on Lebanese patients finds that taking ARBs reduces the incidence of cancer, with greater effects on those who have taken the drug for a long time. A 2021 Korean study and a 2012 Japanese study finds similar results. == References == == Further reading ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
56	Levocetirizine	WIKIPEDIA	Levocetirizine, sold under the brand name Xyzal, among others, is a second-generation antihistamine used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and long-term hives of unclear cause. It is less sedating than older antihistamines. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied and use when breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is classified as a second-generation antihistamine and works by blocking histamine H1-receptors. Levocetirizine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007, and is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 152nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Levocetirizine is used for allergic rhinitis. This includes allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, hives, and itching. == Side effects == Levocetirizine is referred to as a non-sedating antihistamine as it does not enter the brain in significant amounts and is therefore unlikely to cause drowsiness. Cardiac safety with repolarization may be better than some other antihistamines, as levocetirizine does not significantly prolong the QT interval in healthy individuals. However, some people may still experience some slight sleepiness, headache, mouth dryness, lightheadedness, vision problems (mainly blurred vision), palpitations and fatigue. == Pharmacology == Levocetirizine is an antihistamine. It acts as an inverse agonist that decreases activity at histamine H1 receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increases the blood supply to the area, providing relief from the typical symptoms of hay fever. Levocetirizine, (R)-(-)-cetirizine, is essentially a chiral switch of (±)-cetirizine. This enantiomer, the eutomer, is more selective and the (S)-counterpart, the distomer, is inactive. == Chemistry == Chemically, levocetirizine is the active levorotary enantiomer of cetirizine, also called the l-enantiomer of cetirizine. It is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine group of antihistamines. == History == Levocetirizine was first launched in 2001 by the Belgian pharmaceutical company UCB (Union Chimique Belge). == Society and culture == === Availability === In January 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved an over-the-counter preparation. Levocetirizine had previously received authorization by the FDA as a prescription drug in 2007, having already been brought to market throughout much of Europe. In India, a prescription-only drug containing levocetirizine hydrochloride and montelukast is sold as Crohist MK. === Brand names === Preparations of levocetirizine are sold under the following brand names: Xyzal in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland (also Rinozal), Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, The Philippines, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland and UK.

57	1,3-diphenylguanidine	PUBMED	 Recent studies have demonstrated the widespread presence of 1,3-diphenylguanidine (DPG) and its derivatives in environmental matrices. While, the amount of human exposure to these rubber additives remains unclear. In this study, we collected human urine samples from healthy general adults (n = 221) living in Quzhou, China, and analyzed these samples for DPG and its five derivatives. DPG, 1,6-bis(cyano-guanidino)hexane (HCG), 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) and exhibited detection frequencies exceeding 50% in collected human urine. Presence of HCG, 1-(o-tolyl)biguanide (detection frequency 17%), and 1-(4-cyanophenyl)guanidine (6.0%) in human urine was also demonstrated for the first time. The highest mean human urinary concentration was found for DPG (0.89 ng/mL, < LOD-4.7 ng/mL), followed by DTG (0.57 ng/mL, < LOD-3.1 ng/mL) and HCG (0.34 ng/mL, < LOD-1.8 ng/mL). Male participants had consistently higher average human urinary levels of DPG, DTG, and HCG than female subjects, but none of these differences were significant (p > 0.10). DPG and DTQ consistently showed a decline in the human urinary concentrations as age of the participant increased. DPG (mean 170 ng/kg bw/day, median 137 ng/kg bw/day) had the highest human daily exposure amount, followed by DTG (106 ng/kg bw/day, 91 ng/kg bw/day) and HCG (58 ng/kg bw/day, 38 ng/kg bw/day). The study enhances our understanding of human exposure to these rubber additives, which is crucial for assessing their potential health risks. 1,3-Diphenylguanidine (DPG), benzothiazole (BTH), benzotriazole (BTR), and their derivatives are high-production-volume chemicals widely used in tires, corrosion inhibitors and plastic products. Vehicular traffic is an important source of these chemicals in the environment. Despite this, little is known about the occurrence of these chemicals in roadside soils. In this study, we determined the concentrations, profiles, and distribution patterns of 3 DPGs, 5 BTHs, and 7 BTRs in 110 soil samples collected from northeastern United States. We found widespread occurrence of 12 out of the 15 analytes measured in roadside soils, at detection frequencies ≥71 % and median concentrations in the range of 0.38-380 ng/g (dry weight). DPGs were the predominant chemicals accounting for 63 % of the sum concentrations of three chemical classes determined, followed by BTHs (28 %) and BTRs (9 %). The concentrations of all analytes (except for 1-, 4-, and 5-OH-BTRs) exhibited significant positive correlations (r: 0.1-0.9, p < 0.01), suggestive of their common sources and/or similar environmental fates. Higher concentrations of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs were found in soils from highways, rubberized playgrounds, and indoor parking lots than those from gardens, parks, and residential areas. Our findings suggest the release of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs from rubber products, especially automobile tires. Further studies are needed to investigate the environmental fate and toxicities of these chemicals to humans and wildlife. 1,3-Diphenylguanidine (DPG), 1,3-di-	INDUSTRIAL	INDUSTRIAL	{'IND': 0.0, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0}
61	Riboflavin	WIKIPEDIA	"Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a vitamin found in food and sold as a dietary supplement. It is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cellular respiration, and antibody production, as well as normal growth and development. The coenzymes are also required for the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. Riboflavin is prescribed to treat corneal thinning, and taken orally, may reduce the incidence of migraine headaches in adults. Riboflavin deficiency is rare and is usually accompanied by deficiencies of other vitamins and nutrients. It may be prevented or treated by oral supplements or by injections. As a water-soluble vitamin, any riboflavin consumed in excess of nutritional requirements is not stored; it is either not absorbed or is absorbed and quickly excreted in urine, causing the urine to have a bright yellow tint. Natural sources of riboflavin include meat, fish and fowl, eggs, dairy products, green vegetables, mushrooms, and almonds. Some countries require its addition to grains. In its purified, solid form, it is a water-soluble yellow-orange crystalline powder. In addition to its function as a vitamin, it is used as a food coloring agent. Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. Industrial synthesis of riboflavin was initially achieved using a chemical process, but current commercial manufacturing relies on fermentation methods using strains of fungi and genetically modified bacteria. == Definition == Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a water-soluble vitamin and is one of the B vitamins. Unlike folate and vitamin B6, which occur in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, riboflavin is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN, also known as riboflavin-5'-phosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD is the more abundant form of flavin, reported to bind to 75% of the number of flavin-dependent protein encoded genes in the all-species genome (the flavoproteome) and serves as a co-enzyme for 84% of human-encoded flavoproteins. In its purified, solid form, riboflavin is a yellow-orange crystalline powder with a slight odor and bitter taste. It is soluble in polar solvents, such as water and aqueous sodium chloride solutions, and slightly soluble in alcohols. It is not soluble in non-polar or weakly polar organic solvents such as chloroform, benzene or acetone. In solution or during dry storage as a powder, riboflavin is heat stable if not exposed to light. When heated to decompose, it releases toxic fumes containing nitric oxide. == Functions == Riboflavin is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, FMN and FAD. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cell respiration, antibody production, growth and development. Riboflavin is essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and fats. FAD contributes to the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (vitamin B3) and the conversion of vitamin B6 to the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate requires FMN. Riboflavin is involved in maintaining normal circulating levels of homocysteine; in riboflavin deficiency, homocysteine levels increase, elevating the risk of cardiovascular diseases. === Redox reactions === Redox reactions are processes that involve the transfer of electrons. The flavin coenzymes support the function of roughly 70-80 flavoenzymes in humans (and hundreds more across all organisms, including those encoded by archeal, bacterial and fungal genomes) that are responsible for one- or two-electron redox reactions which capitalize on the ability of flavins to be converted between oxidized, half-reduced and fully reduced forms. FAD is also required for the activity of glutathione reductase, an essential enzyme in the formation of the endogenous antioxidant, glutathione. === Micronutrient metabolism === Riboflavin, FMN, and FAD are involved in the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. The synthesis of the niacin-containing coenzymes, NAD and NADP, from tryptophan involves the FAD-dependent enzyme, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase. Dietary deficiency of riboflavin can decrease the production of NAD and NADP, thereby promoting niacin deficiency. Conversion of vitamin B6 to its coenzyme, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, involves the enzyme, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase, which requires FMN. An enzyme involved in folate metabolism, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, requires FAD to form the amino acid, methionine, from homocysteine. Riboflavin deficiency appears to impair the metabolism of the dietary mineral, iron, which is essential to the production of hemoglobin and red blood cells. Alleviating riboflavin deficiency in people who are deficient in both riboflavin and iron improves the effectiveness of iron supplementation for treating iron-deficiency anemia. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. The biosynthetic precursors to riboflavin are ribulose 5-phosphate and guanosine triphosphate. The former is converted to L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate while the latter is transformed in a series of reactions that lead to 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil. These two compounds are then the substrates for the penultimate step in the pathway, catalysed by the enzyme lumazine synthase in reaction EC 2.5.1.78. In the final step of the biosynthesis, two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine are combined by the enzyme riboflavin synthase in a dismutation reaction. This generates one molecule of riboflavin and one of 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino) uracil. The latter is recycled to the previous reaction in the sequence. Conversions of riboflavin to the cofactors FMN and FAD are carried out by the enzymes riboflavin kinase and FAD synthetase acting sequentially. === Industrial synthesis === The industrial-scale production of riboflavin uses various microorganisms, including filamentous fungi such as Ashbya gossypii, Candida famata and Candida flaveri, as well as the bacteria Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis that has been genetically modified to both increase the production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic (ampicillin) resistance marker, is employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification. By 2012, over 4,000 tonnes per annum were produced by such fermentation processes. In the presence of high concentrations of hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds, some bacteria overproduce riboflavin, possibly as a protective mechanism. One such organism is Micrococcus luteus (American Type Culture Collection strain number ATCC 49442), which develops a yellow color due to production of riboflavin while growing on pyridine, but not when grown on other substrates, such as succinic acid. === Laboratory synthesis === The first total synthesis of riboflavin was carried out by Richard Kuhn's group. A substituted aniline, produced by reductive amination using D-ribose, was condensed with alloxan in the final step: == Uses == === Treatment of corneal thinning === Keratoconus is the most common form of corneal ectasia, a progressive thinning of the cornea. The condition is treated by corneal collagen cross-linking, which increases corneal stiffness. Cross-linking is achieved by applying a topical riboflavin solution to the cornea, which is then exposed to ultraviolet A light. === Migraine prevention === In its 2012 guidelines, the American Academy of Neurology stated that high-dose riboflavin (400 mg) is ""probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention,"" a recommendation also provided by the UK National Migraine Centre. A 2017 review reported that daily riboflavin taken at 400 mg per day for at least three months may reduce the frequency of migraine headaches in adults. Research on high-dose riboflavin for migraine prevention or treatment in children and adolescents is inconclusive, and so supplements are not recommended. === Food coloring === Riboflavin is used as a food coloring (yellow-orange crystalline powder), and is designated with the E number, E101, in Europe for use as a food additive. == Dietary recommendations == The National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for riboflavin in 1998. The EARs for riboflavin for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9 mg/day and 1.1 mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.3 mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy is 1.4 mg/day and the RDA for lactating females is 1.6 mg/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.3–0.4 mg/day and for children aged 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of riboflavin there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For women and men aged 15 and older the PRI is set at 1.6 mg/day. The PRI during pregnancy is 1.9 mg/day and the PRI for lactating females is 2.0 mg/day. For children aged 1–14 years the PRIs increase with age from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA also considered the maximum safe intake and like the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, decided that there was not sufficient information to set an UL. === Safety === In humans, there is no evidence for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes and absorption becomes less efficient as dosage increases. Any excess riboflavin is excreted via the kidneys into urine, resulting in a bright yellow color known as flavinuria. During a clinical trial on the effectiveness of riboflavin for treating the frequency and severity of migraines, subjects were given up to 400 mg of riboflavin orally per day for periods of 3–12 months. Abdominal pains and diarrhea were among the side effects reported. === Labeling === For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For riboflavin labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 1.7 mg, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 1.3 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == The United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service maintains a food composition database from which riboflavin content in hundreds of foods can be searched. The white flour produced after milling of wheat has only 67% of its original riboflavin amount left, so white flour is enriched in some countries. Riboflavin is also added to ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. It is difficult to incorporate riboflavin into liquid products because it has poor solubility in water, hence the requirement for riboflavin-5'-phosphate (FMN, also called E101 when used as colorant), a more soluble form of riboflavin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of the vitamin. Free riboflavin is naturally present in animal-sourced foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Cows' milk contains mainly free riboflavin, but both FMN and FAD are present at low concentrations. === Fortification === Some countries require or recommend fortification of grain foods. As of 2024, 57 countries, mostly in North and South America and southeast Africa, require food fortification of wheat flour or maize (corn) flour with riboflavin or riboflavin-5'-phosphate sodium. The amounts stipulated range from 1.3 to 5.75 mg/kg. An additional 16 countries have a voluntary fortification program. For example, the Indian government recommends 4.0 mg/kg for ""maida"" (white) and ""atta"" (whole wheat) flour. == Absorption, metabolism, excretion == More than 90% of riboflavin in the diet is in the form of protein-bound FMN and FAD. Exposure to gastric acid in the stomach releases the coenzymes, which are subsequently enzymatically hydrolyzed in the proximal small intestine to release free riboflavin. Absorption occurs via a rapid active transport system, with some additional passive diffusion occurring at high concentrations. Bile salts facilitate uptake, so absorption is improved when the vitamin is consumed with a meal. The majority of newly absorbed riboflavin is taken up by the liver on the first pass, indicating that postprandial appearance of riboflavin in blood plasma may underestimate absorption. Three riboflavin transporter proteins have been identified: RFVT1 is present in the small intestine and also in the placenta; RFVT2 is highly expressed in brain and salivary glands; and RFVT3 is most highly expressed in the small intestine, testes, and prostate. Infants with mutations in the genes encoding these transport proteins can be treated with riboflavin administered orally. Riboflavin is reversibly converted to FMN and then FAD. From riboflavin to FMN is the function of zinc-requiring riboflavin kinase; the reverse is accomplished by a phosphatase. From FMN to FAD is the function of magnesium-requiring FAD synthase; the reverse is accomplished by a pyrophosphatase. FAD appears to be an inhibitory end-product that down-regulates its own formation. When excess riboflavin is absorbed by the small intestine, it is quickly removed from the blood and excreted in urine. Urine color is used as a hydration status biomarker and, under normal conditions, correlates with urine specific gravity and urine osmolality. However, riboflavin supplementation in large excess of requirements causes urine to appear more yellow than normal. With normal dietary intake, about two-thirds of urinary output is riboflavin, the remainder having been partially metabolized to hydroxymethylriboflavin from oxidation within cells, and as other metabolites. When consumption exceeds the ability to absorb, riboflavin passes into the large intestine, where it is catabolized by bacteria to various metabolites that can be detected in feces. There is speculation that unabsorbed riboflavin could affect the large intestine microbiome. == Deficiency == === Prevalence === Riboflavin deficiency is uncommon in the United States and in other countries with wheat flour or corn meal fortification programs. From data collected in biannual surveys of the U.S. population, for ages 20 and over, 22% of women and 19% of men reported consuming a supplement that contained riboflavin, typically a vitamin-mineral multi-supplement. For the non-supplement users, the dietary intake of adult women averaged 1.74 mg/day and men 2.44 mg/day. These amounts exceed the RDAs for riboflavin of 1.1 and 1.3 mg/day respectively. For all age groups, on average, consumption from food exceeded the RDAs. A 2001-02 U.S. survey reported that less than 3% of the population consumed less than the Estimated Average Requirement of riboflavin. === Signs and symptoms === Riboflavin deficiency (also called ariboflavinosis) results in stomatitis, symptoms of which include chapped and fissured lips, inflammation of the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis), sore throat, painful red tongue, and hair loss. The eyes can become itchy, watery, bloodshot, and sensitive to light. Riboflavin deficiency is associated with anemia. Prolonged riboflavin insufficiency may cause degeneration of the liver and nervous system. Riboflavin deficiency may increase the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women. Deficiency of riboflavin during pregnancy can result in fetal birth defects, including heart and limb deformities. === Risk factors === People at risk of having low riboflavin levels include alcoholics, vegetarian athletes, and practitioners of veganism. Pregnant or lactating women and their infants may also be at risk, if the mother avoids meat and dairy products. Anorexia and lactose intolerance increase the risk of riboflavin deficiency. People with physically demanding lives, such as athletes and laborers, may require higher riboflavin intake. The conversion of riboflavin into FAD and FMN is impaired in people with hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and riboflavin transporter deficiency. === Causes === Riboflavin deficiency is usually found together with other nutrient deficiencies, particularly of other water-soluble vitamins. A deficiency of riboflavin can be primary (i.e. caused by poor vitamin sources in the regular diet) or secondary, which may be a result of conditions that affect absorption in the intestine. Secondary deficiencies are typically caused by the body not being able to use the vitamin, or by an increased rate of excretion of the vitamin. Diet patterns that increase risk of deficiency include veganism and low-dairy vegetarianism. Diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes may cause or exacerbate riboflavin deficiency. There are rare genetic defects that compromise riboflavin absorption, transport, metabolism or use by flavoproteins. One of these is riboflavin transporter deficiency, previously known as Brown–Vialetto–Van Laere syndrome. Variants of the genes SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 which code for transporter proteins RDVT2 and RDVT3, respectively, are defective. Infants and young children present with muscle weakness, cranial nerve deficits including hearing loss, sensory symptoms including sensory ataxia, feeding difficulties, and respiratory distress caused by a sensorimotor axonal neuropathy and cranial nerve pathology. When untreated, infants with riboflavin transporter deficiency have labored breathing and are at risk of dying in the first decade of life. Treatment with oral supplementation of high amounts of riboflavin is lifesaving. Other inborn errors of metabolism include riboflavin-responsive multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as a subset of glutaric acidemia type 2, and the C677T variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme, which in adults has been associated with risk of high blood pressure. === Diagnosis and assessment === The assessment of riboflavin status is essential for confirming cases with non-specific symptoms whenever deficiency is suspected. Total riboflavin excretion in healthy adults with normal riboflavin intake is about 120 micrograms per day, while excretion of less than 40 micrograms per day indicates deficiency. Riboflavin excretion rates decrease as a person ages, but increase during periods of chronic stress and the use of some prescription drugs. Indicators used in humans are erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR), erythrocyte flavin concentration and urinary excretion. The erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient (EGRAC) provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. Results are expressed as an activity coefficient ratio, determined by enzyme activity with and without the addition of FAD to the culture medium. An EGRAC of 1.0 to 1.2 indicates that adequate amounts of riboflavin are present; 1.2 to 1.4 is considered low, greater than 1.4 indicates deficient. For the less sensitive ""erythrocyte flavin method"", values greater than 400 nmol/L are considered adequate and values below 270 nmol/L are considered deficient. Urinary excretion is expressed as nmol of riboflavin per gram of creatinine. Low is defined as in the range of 50 to 72 nmol/g. Deficient is below 50 nmol/g. Urinary excretion load tests have been used to determine dietary requirements. For adult men, as oral doses were increased from 0.5 mg to 1.1 mg, there was a modest linear increase in urinary riboflavin, reaching 100 micrograms for a subsequent 24-hour urine collection. Beyond a load dose of 1.1 mg, urinary excretion increased rapidly, so that with a dose of 2.5 mg, urinary output was 800 micrograms for a 24-hour urine collection. == History == The name ""riboflavin"" comes from ""ribose"" (the sugar whose reduced form, ribitol, forms part of its structure) and ""flavin"", the ring-moiety that imparts the yellow color to the oxidized molecule (from Latin flavus, ""yellow""). The reduced form, which occurs in metabolism along with the oxidized form, appears as orange-yellow needles or crystals. The earliest reported identification, predating any concept of vitamins as essential nutrients, was by Alexander Wynter Blyth. In 1879, Blyth isolated a water-soluble component of cows' milk whey, which he named ""lactochrome"", that fluoresced yellow-green when exposed to light. In the early 1900s, several research laboratories were investigating constituents of foods, essential to maintain growth in rats. These constituents were initially divided into fat-soluble ""vitamine"" A and water-soluble ""vitamine"" B. (The ""e"" was dropped in 1920.) Vitamin B was further thought to have two components, a heat-labile substance called B1 and a heat-stable substance called B2. Vitamin B2 was tentatively identified to be the factor necessary for preventing pellagra, but that was later confirmed to be due to niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency. The confusion was due to the fact that riboflavin (B2) deficiency causes stomatitis symptoms similar to those seen in pellagra, but without the widespread peripheral skin lesions. For this reason, early in the history of identifying riboflavin deficiency in humans the condition was sometimes called ""pellagra sine pellagra"" (pellagra without pellagra). In 1935, Paul Gyorgy, in collaboration with chemist Richard Kuhn and physician T. Wagner-Jauregg, reported that rats kept on a B2-free diet were unable to gain weight. Isolation of B2 from yeast revealed the presence of a bright yellow-green fluorescent product that restored normal growth when fed to rats. The growth restored was directly proportional to the intensity of the fluorescence. This observation enabled the researchers to develop a rapid chemical bioassay in 1933, and then isolate the factor from egg white, calling it ovoflavin. The same group then isolated the a similar preparation from whey and called it lactoflavin. In 1934, Kuhn's group identified the chemical structure of these flavins as identical, settled on ""riboflavin"" as a name, and were also able to synthesize the vitamin. Circa 1937, riboflavin was also referred to as ""Vitamin G"". In 1938, Richard Kuhn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on vitamins, which had included B2 and B6. In 1939, it was confirmed that riboflavin is essential for human health through a clinical trial conducted by William H. Sebrell and Roy E. Butler. Women fed a diet low in riboflavin developed stomatitis and other signs of deficiency, which were reversed when treated with synthetic riboflavin. The symptoms returned when the supplements were stopped. == References =="	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.078343436, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' FOOD': -6.7901296e-05}
62	Mycophenolic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Mycophenolic acid is an immunosuppressant medication used to prevent rejection following organ transplantation and to treat autoimmune conditions such as Crohn's disease and lupus. Specifically it is used following kidney, heart, and liver transplantation. It can be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. It comes as mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate mofetil. Common side effects include nausea, infections, and diarrhea. Other serious side effects include an increased risk of cancer, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It works by blocking inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is needed by lymphocytes to make guanosine. Mycophenolic acid was initially discovered by Italian Bartolomeo Gosio in 1893. It was rediscovered in 1945 and 1968. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1995 following the discovery of its immunosuppressive properties in the 1990s. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 227th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Organ transplant === Mycophenolate is used for the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil is indicated for the prevention of organ transplant rejection in adults and kidney transplantation rejection in children over 2 years; whereas mycophenolate sodium is indicated for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection in adults. Mycophenolate sodium has also been used for the prevention of rejection in liver, heart, or lung transplants in children older than two years. === Autoimmune disease === Mycophenolate is increasingly utilized as a steroid sparing treatment in autoimmune diseases and similar immune-mediated disorders including Behçet's disease, pemphigus vulgaris, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, small vessel vasculitides, and psoriasis. It is also used for retroperitoneal fibrosis along with a number of other medications. Specifically it has also be used for psoriasis not treatable by other methods. Its increasing application in treating lupus nephritis has demonstrated more frequent complete response and less frequent complications compared to cyclophosphamide bolus therapy, a regimen with risk of bone marrow suppression, infertility, and malignancy. Further work addressing maintenance therapy demonstrated mycophenolate superior to cyclophosphamide, again in terms of response and side-effects. Walsh proposed that mycophenolate should be considered as a first-line induction therapy for treatment of lupus nephritis in people without kidney dysfunction. === Comparison to other agents === Compared with azathioprine it has higher incidence of diarrhea, and no difference in risk of any of the other side effects in transplant patients. Mycophenolic acid is 15 times more expensive than azathioprine. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (≥ 1% of people) include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint pain; infections, leukopenia, or anemia reflect the immunosuppressive and myelosuppressive nature of the drug. Mycophenolate sodium is also commonly associated with fatigue, headache, cough and/or breathing issues. Intravenous (IV) administration of mycophenolate mofetil is also commonly associated with thrombophlebitis and thrombosis. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of people) include esophagitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, and/or invasive cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. More rarely, pulmonary fibrosis or various neoplasia occur: melanoma, lymphoma, other malignancies having an occurrences of 1 in 20 to 1 in 200, depending on the type, with neoplasia in the skin being the most common site. Several cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have also been reported. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert that people are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, such as activation of latent viral infections, including shingles, other herpes infections, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus associated nephropathy. In addition the FDA is investigating 16 people that developed a rare neurological disease while taking the drug. This is a viral infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; it attacks the brain and is usually fatal. === Pregnancy === Mycophenolic acid is associated with miscarriage and congenital malformations when used during pregnancy, and should be avoided whenever possible by women trying to get pregnant. === Blood tests === Among the most common effects of this drug is increased blood cholesterol levels. Other changes in blood chemistry such as hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) can occur. == Mechanism of action == Purines (including the nucleosides guanosine and adenosine) can either be synthesized de novo using ribose 5-phosphate or they can be salvaged from free nucleotides. Mycophenolic acid is a potent, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme essential to the de novo synthesis of guanosine-5'-monophosphate (GMP) from inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP). IMPDH inhibition particularly affects lymphocytes since they rely almost exclusively on de novo purine synthesis. In contrast, many other cell types use both pathways, and some cells, such as terminally differentiated neurons, depend completely on purine nucleotide salvage. Thus, use of mycophenolic acid leads to a relatively selective inhibition of DNA replication in T cells and B cells. == Pharmacology == Mycophenolate can be derived from the fungi Penicillium stoloniferum, P. brevicompactum and P. echinulatum. Mycophenolate mofetil is metabolised in the liver to the active moiety mycophenolic acid. It reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that controls the rate of synthesis of guanine monophosphate in the de novo pathway of purine synthesis used in the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Other cells recover purines via a separate salvage pathway and are thus able to escape the effect. Mycophenolate is potent and can, in many contexts, be used in place of the older anti-proliferative azathioprine. It is usually used as part of a three-compound regimen of immunosuppressants, also including a calcineurin inhibitor (ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and a glucocorticoid (e.g. dexamethasone or prednisone). == Chemistry == Mycophenolate mofetil is the morpholino‌ ethyl ester of mycophenolic acid; the ester masks the carboxyl group. Mycophenolate mofetil is reported to have a pKa values of 5.6 for the morpholino moiety and 8.5 for the phenolic group. == History == Mycophenolic acid was discovered by Italian medical scientist Bartolomeo Gosio. Gosio collected a fungus from spoiled corn and named it Penicillium glaucum. (The species is now called P. brevicompactum.) In 1893 he found that the fungus had antibacterial activity. In 1896 he isolated crystals of the compound, which he successfully demonstrated as the active antibacterial compound against the anthrax bacterium. This was the first antibiotic that was isolated in pure and crystalline form. But the discovery was forgotten. It was rediscovered by two American scientists C.L. Alsberg and O.M. Black in 1912, and given the name mycophenolic acid. The compound was eventually demonstrated to have antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antipsoriasis activities. Although it is not commercialised as antibiotic due to its adverse effects, its modified compound (ester derivative) is an approved immunosuppressant drug in kidney, heart, and liver transplantations, and is marketed under the brands CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil by Roche) and Myfortic (mycophenolate sodium by Novartis). Cellcept was developed by a South African geneticist Anthony Allison and his wife Elsie M. Eugui. In the 1970s while working at the Medical Research Council, Allison investigated the biochemical causes of immune deficiency in children. He discovered the metabolic pathway involving an enzyme, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is responsible for undesirable immune response in autoimmune diseases, as well as for immune rejection in organ transplantation. He conceived an idea that if a molecule that could block the enzyme is discovered, then, it would become an immunosuppressive drug that could be used for autoimmune diseases and in organ transplantation. In 1981 he decided to go for drug discovery and approached several pharmaceutical companies, which turned him down one by one as he had no primary knowledge of drug research. However, Syntex liked his plans and asked him to join the company with his wife. He became vice president for the research. In one of their experiments the Allisons used an antibacterial compound, mycophenolate mofetil, which was abandoned in clinical use due to its adverse effects. They discovered that the compound had immunosuppressive activity. They synthesised a chemical variant for increased activity and reduced adverse effects. They subsequently demonstrated that it was useful in organ transplantation in experimental rats. After successful clinical trials, the compound was approved for use in kidney transplant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 3 May 1995, and was sold under the brand name CellCept. It was approved for use in the European Union in February 1996. == Names == It was initially introduced as the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, trade name CellCept) to improve oral bioavailability. The salt mycophenolate sodium has also been introduced. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is an alternative MPA formulation. MMF and EC-MPS appear to be equal in benefits and safety. == Research == Mycophenolate mofetil is beginning to be used in the management of auto-immune disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma (systemic sclerosis or SSc), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) with success for some patients. It is also being used as a long-term therapy for maintaining remission of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, though thus far, studies have found it inferior to azathioprine. A combination of mycophenolate and ribavirin has been found to stop infection by and replication of dengue virus in vitro. It has also shown promising antiviral activity against MERS, especially in combination with interferon. Preliminary data suggest that mycophenolate mofetil might have benefits in people with multiple sclerosis. However the evidence is insufficient to determine the effects as an add‐on therapy for interferon beta-1a in people with RRMS. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
63	Meclizine	WIKIPEDIA	Meclizine, sold under the brand name Bonine, among others, is an antihistamine used to treat motion sickness and dizziness (vertigo). It is taken by mouth. Effects generally begin in an hour and last for up to a day. Common side effects include sleepiness and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include allergic reactions. Use in pregnancy appears safe, but has not been well studied; use in breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is believed to work in part by anticholinergic and antihistamine mechanisms. Meclizine was patented in 1951 and came into medical use in 1953. It is available as a generic medication and often over the counter. In 2022, it was the 129th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Meclizine is used to treat symptoms of motion sickness. === Motion sickness === Meclizine is effective in inhibiting nausea, vomiting, and dizziness caused by motion sickness. The drug is safe for treating nausea in pregnancy and is a first-line therapy for this use. Meclizine may not be strong enough for especially sickening motion stimuli, and second-line defenses should be tried in those cases. === Vertigo === Meclizine may be used to treat vertigo, such as in those with Ménière's disease. == Side effects == Some common side effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth, and tiredness may occur. Meclizine has been shown to have fewer dry mouth side effects than the traditional treatment for motion sickness, transdermal scopolamine. A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is unlikely, but immediate medical attention should be sought if it occurs. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Meclizine is an antagonist at H1 receptors (Ki = 250 nM). It possesses anticholinergic, central nervous system depressant, and local anesthetic effects. Its antiemetic and antivertigo effects are not fully understood, but its central anticholinergic properties are partially responsible. The drug depresses labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation, and it may affect the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. The drug has been shown to reduce the magnitude of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in healthy volunteers. At the same time the drug was found to have only a small (and statistically insignificant) effect on the motion sensitivity of the utricles. Much as motion sickness arises from a discrepancy between multiple senses, meclizine most likely affects a wide array of sensory mechanisms related to self-motion while leaving the core vestibular response intact. Meclizine also has been reported to be a weak dopamine antagonist at D1-like and D2-like receptors but it does not cause catalepsy in mice, perhaps because of its anticholinergic activity. The drug does not effect dopamine or serotonin reuptake. === Pharmacokinetics === Meclizine reaches peak plasma concentration in about 1.5 hours and has an elimination half-life of 5-6 hours. Despite its relatively short half-life, the drug is reported to remain effective for motion sickness for 12 - 24 hours. Meclizine has low bioavailability (22–32%) and a delayed onset to action in part due to its poor solubility in water (0.1 mg/ml) and gastrointestinal fluid. In children it has been found that taking meclizine with food increases its bioavailability slightly. It is metabolized in the liver by the CYP2D6 enzyme. Ten metabolites have been identified. In rats, the main metabolite is norchlorcyclizine, which distributes extensively through body tissue. == Chemistry == Meclizine is a first-generation antihistamine (nonselective H1 antagonist) of the piperazine class. It is structurally and pharmacologically similar to buclizine, cyclizine, and hydroxyzine. === Synthesis === (4-Chlorophenyl)-phenylmethanol is halogenated with thionyl chloride before adding acetylpiperazine. The acetyl group is cleaved with diluted sulfuric acid. An N-alkylation of the piperazine ring with 3-methylbenzylchloride completes the synthesis. Alternatively, the last step can be replaced by a reductive N-alkylation with 3-methylbenzaldehyde. The reductive agent is hydrogen, and Raney nickel is used as a catalyst. Meclizine is obtained and used as a racemate, a 1:1 mixture of the two stereoisomers. Drug forms contain the racemic dihydrochloride. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Meclizine is an international nonproprietary name. It is sold under the brand names Bonine, Bonamine, Antivert, Postafen, Sea Legs, and Dramamine II (Less Drowsy Formulation). Emesafene is a combination of meclizine (1/3) and pyridoxine (2/3). In Canada, Antivert Tab was a combination of meclizine and nicotinic acid. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.0280384e-06, 'ICAL': -3.1281633e-07}
64	Dihydrocapsaicin	WIKIPEDIA	Dihydrocapsaicin is a capsaicinoid and analog and congener of capsaicin in chili peppers (Capsicum). Like capsaicin, it is an irritant.

65	N-trans-feruloyltyramine	PUBMED	 Mounting evidence supports the potential of dietary bioactives to reduce chronic disease risk.  Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway can regulate inflammatory and immune responses. N-trans-feruloyltyramine (FLA) is an active phenylpropanoid compound. It possesses antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-melanogenesis, and anticancer activities. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying FLA modulation of cytokine expression in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages have not been fully investigated. In this study, we examined the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulative effects of FLA isolated from Arcangelisia gusanlung. FLA strongly suppressed mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), but not tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, thereby inhibiting the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, FLA also inhibited nuclear translocation of activation protein (AP)-1, and simultaneously decreased the expression and phosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protein. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of FLA might be attributed to downregulation of COX-2 and iNOS via suppression of AP-1 and the JNK signalling pathway in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In this study, we examined the effect of N-trans-feruloyltyramine (FA) on melanogenesis in mouse B16 melanoma cells. Melanogenesis was inhibited by FA in a dose-dependent manner. FA exhibited a greater potency than kojic acid as a standard inhibitor of melanogenesis. Moreover, treatment of B16 melanoma cells with FA was found to cause marked decreases in the expression levels of tyrosinase. FA-induced downregulation of tyrosinase resulted in suppression of melanin biosynthesis in murine B16 melanoma cells.	MEDICAL, FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -0.018134026, 'OD': 0.0}
69	Carbamazepine	WIKIPEDIA	"Carbamazepine, sold under the brand name Tegretol among others, is an anticonvulsant medication used in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. It is used as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia along with other medications and as a second-line agent in bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine appears to work as well as phenytoin and valproate for focal and generalized seizures. It is not effective for absence or myoclonic seizures. Carbamazepine was discovered in 1953 by Swiss chemist Walter Schindler. It was first marketed in 1962. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2020, it was the 185th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. Photoswitchable analogues of carbamazepine have been developed to control its pharmacological activity locally and on demand using light (photopharmacology), with the purpose of reducing the adverse systemic effects of the drug. One of these light-regulated compounds (carbadiazocine, based on a bridged azobenzene or diazocine) has been shown to produce analgesia with noninvasive illumination in vivo in a rat model of neuropathic pain. == Medical uses == Carbamazepine is typically used for the treatment of seizure disorders and neuropathic pain. It is used off-label as a second-line treatment for bipolar disorder and in combination with an antipsychotic in some cases of schizophrenia when treatment with a conventional antipsychotic alone has failed. However, evidence does not support its usage for schizophrenia. It is not effective for absence seizures or myoclonic seizures. Although carbamazepine may have a similar effectiveness (as measured by people continuing to use a medication) and efficacy (as measured by the medicine reducing seizure recurrence and improving remission) when compared to phenytoin and valproate, choice of medication should be evaluated on an individual basis as further research is needed to determine which medication is most helpful for people with newly-onset seizures. In the United States, carbamazepine is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy (including partial seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and mixed seizures), and trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine is the only medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. As of 2014, a controlled release formulation was available for which there is tentative evidence showing fewer side effects and unclear evidence with regard to whether there is a difference in efficacy. It has also been shown to improve symptoms of ""typewriter tinnitus"", a type of tinnitus caused by the neurovascular compression of the cochleovestibular nerve. == Adverse effects == In the US, the label for carbamazepine contains warnings concerning: effects on the body's production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets: rarely, there are major effects of aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis reported and more commonly, there are minor changes such as decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, but these do not progress to more serious problems. increased risks of suicide increased risks of hyponatremia and SIADH risk of seizures, if the person stops taking the drug abruptly risks to the fetus in women who are pregnant, specifically congenital malformations like spina bifida, and developmental disorders. Pancreatitis Hepatitis Dizziness Bone marrow suppression Stevens–Johnson syndrome Common adverse effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and migraines, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and/or constipation. Alcohol use while taking carbamazepine may lead to enhanced depression of the central nervous system. Less common side effects may include increased risk of seizures in people with mixed seizure disorders, abnormal heart rhythms, blurry or double vision. Also, rare case reports of an auditory side effect have been made, whereby patients perceive sounds about a semitone lower than previously; this unusual side effect is usually not noticed by most people, and disappears after the person stops taking carbamazepine. === Pharmacogenetics === Serious skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) due to carbamazepine therapy are more common in people with a particular human leukocyte antigen gene-variant (allele), HLA-B*1502. Odds ratios for the development of SJS or TEN in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied. HLA-B*1502 occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele has been shown to be a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions, such as the DRESS form of severe cutaneous reactions, to carbamazepine among Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Europeans. It is suggested that carbamazepine acts as a potent antigen that binds to the antigen-presenting area of HLA-B*1502 alike, triggering an everlasting activation signal on immature CD8-T cells, thus resulting in widespread cytotoxic reactions like SJS/TEN. == Interactions == Carbamazepine has a potential for drug interactions. Drugs that decrease breaking down of carbamazepine or otherwise increase its levels include erythromycin, cimetidine, propoxyphene, and calcium channel blockers. Grapefruit juice raises the bioavailability of carbamazepine by inhibiting the enzyme CYP3A4 in the gut wall and in the liver. Lower levels of carbamazepine are seen when administered with phenobarbital, phenytoin, or primidone, which can result in breakthrough seizure activity. Valproic acid and valnoctamide both inhibit microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide into inactive metabolites. By inhibiting mEH, valproic acid and valnoctamide cause a build-up of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion. Carbamazepine, as an inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, may increase clearance of many drugs, decreasing their concentration in the blood to subtherapeutic levels and reducing their desired effects. Drugs that are more rapidly metabolized with carbamazepine include warfarin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, theophylline, valproic acid, many benzodiazepines, and methadone. Carbamazepine also increases the metabolism of the hormones in birth control pills and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Carbamazepine is a sodium channel blocker. It binds preferentially to voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactive conformation, which prevents repetitive and sustained firing of an action potential. Carbamazepine has effects on serotonin systems but the relevance to its antiseizure effects is uncertain. There is evidence that it is a serotonin releasing agent and possibly even a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It has been suggested that carbamazepine can also block voltage-gated calcium channels, which will reduce neurotransmitter release. === Pharmacokinetics === Carbamazepine is relatively slowly but practically completely absorbed after administration by mouth. Highest concentrations in the blood plasma are reached after 4 to 24 hours depending on the dosage form. Slow release tablets result in about 15% lower absorption and 25% lower peak plasma concentrations than ordinary tablets, as well as in less fluctuation of the concentration, but not in significantly lower minimum concentrations. In the circulation, carbamazepine itself comprises 20 to 30% of total residues. The remainder is in the form of metabolites; 70 to 80% of residues is bound to plasma proteins. Concentrations in breast milk are 25 to 60% of those in the blood plasma. Carbamazepine itself is not pharmacologically active. It is activated, mainly by CYP3A4, to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, which is solely responsible for the drug's anticonvulsant effects. The epoxide is then inactivated by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) to carbamazepine-trans-10,11-diol and further to its glucuronides. Other metabolites include various hydroxyl derivatives and carbamazepine-N-glucuronide. The plasma half-life is about 35 to 40 hours when carbamazepine is given as single dose, but it is a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and the plasma half-life shortens to about 12 to 17 hours when it is given repeatedly. The half-life can be further shortened to 9–10 hours by other enzyme inducers such as phenytoin or phenobarbital. About 70% are excreted via the urine, almost exclusively in form of its metabolites, and 30% via the faeces. == History == Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of Novartis) in Basel, Switzerland, in 1953. It was first marketed as a drug to treat epilepsy in Switzerland in 1963 under the brand name Tegretol; its use for trigeminal neuralgia (formerly known as tic douloureux) was introduced at the same time. It has been used as an anticonvulsant and antiepileptic in the United Kingdom since 1965, and has been approved in the United States since 1968. Carbamazepine was studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s. == Society and culture == === Environmental impact === Carbamazepine and its bio-transformation products have been detected in wastewater treatment plant effluent: 224 and in streams receiving treated wastewater. Field and laboratory studies have been conducted to understand the accumulation of carbamazepine in food plants grown in soil treated with sludge, which vary with respect to the concentrations of carbamazepine present in sludge and in the concentrations of sludge in the soil. Taking into account only studies that used concentrations commonly found in the environment, a 2014 review concluded that ""the accumulation of carbamazepine into plants grown in soil amended with biosolids poses a de minimis risk to human health according to the approach."": 227 === Brand names === Carbamazepine is available worldwide under many brand names including Tegretol. == Research == == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Carbamazepine"".

70	Curcumin	WIKIPEDIA	"Curcumin is a bright yellow chemical produced by plants of the Curcuma longa species. It is the principal curcuminoid of turmeric (Curcuma longa), a member of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. It is sold as a herbal supplement, cosmetics ingredient, food flavoring, and food coloring. Chemically, curcumin is a polyphenol, more particularly a diarylheptanoid, belonging to the group of curcuminoids, which are phenolic pigments responsible for the yellow color of turmeric. Laboratory and clinical research have not confirmed any medical use for curcumin. It is difficult to study because it is both unstable and poorly bioavailable. It is unlikely to produce useful leads for drug development as a lead compound. == History == Curcumin was named in 1815 when Henri Auguste Vogel and Pierre Joseph Pelletier reported the first isolation of a ""yellow coloring-matter"" from the rhizomes of turmeric. Later, it was found to be a mixture of resin and turmeric oil. In 1910, Milobedzka and Lampe reported the chemical structure of curcumin to be as diferuloylmethane. Later in 1913, the same group accomplished the synthesis of the compound. Although used in traditional medicine, the possible therapeutic properties of turmeric or curcumin remain undetermined. == Uses == The most common applications are as an ingredient in dietary supplement, in cosmetics, as flavoring for foods, such as turmeric-flavored beverages in South and Southeast Asia, and as coloring for foods, such as curry powders, mustards, butters, and cheeses. As a food additive for orange-yellow coloring in prepared foods, its E number is E 100 in the European Union. It is also approved by the U.S. FDA to be used as a food coloring in US. Curcumin is used as a complexometric indicator for boron. It reacts with boric acid to form a red-colored compound, rosocyanine. == Chemistry == Curcumin incorporates a seven carbon linker and three major functional groups: an α,β-unsaturated β-diketone moiety and an aromatic O-methoxy-phenolic group. The aromatic ring systems, which are phenols, are connected by two α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups. It is a diketone tautomer, existing in enolic form in organic solvents and in keto form in water. The diketones form stable enols and are readily deprotonated to form enolates; the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group is a good Michael acceptor and undergoes nucleophilic addition. Because of its hydrophobic nature, curcumin is poorly soluble in water but is easily soluble in organic solvents. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthetic route of curcumin is uncertain. In 1973, Peter J. Roughley and Donald A. Whiting proposed two mechanisms for curcumin biosynthesis. The first mechanism involves a chain extension reaction by cinnamic acid and 5 malonyl-CoA molecules that eventually arylize into a curcuminoid. The second mechanism involves two cinnamate units coupled together by malonyl-CoA. Both use cinnamic acid as their starting point, which is derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. Plant biosynthesis starting with cinnamic acid is rare compared to the more common p-coumaric acid. Only a few identified compounds, such as anigorufone and pinosylvin, build from cinnamic acid. == Pharmacology == Curcumin, which shows positive results in most drug discovery assays, is regarded as a false lead that medicinal chemists include among ""pan-assay interference compounds"". This attracts undue experimental attention while failing to advance as viable therapeutic or drug leads, although some derivatives of curcumin such as EF-24 have seen a significant amount of research. Factors that limit the bioactivity of curcumin or its analogs include chemical instability, water insolubility, absence of potent and selective target activity, low bioavailability, limited tissue distribution, and extensive metabolism. Very little curcumin escapes the GI tract and most is excreted in feces unchanged. If curcumin enters plasma in reasonable amounts, there is a high risk of toxicity since it is promiscuous, and interacts with several proteins known to increase the risk of adverse effects, including hERG, cytochrome P450s, and glutathione S-transferase. == Safety == As a component of turmeric, curcumin may interact with prescription drugs and dietary supplements. In high amounts, it may be unsafe for women during pregnancy. It may cause side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, hives, or dizziness. Between 2004 and 2022 there were ten cases of liver injury caused by curcumin herbal and dietary supplements. Curcumin is a contact allergen. The intended use of curcumin as a food additive is generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. == Medical research == Although curcumin has been assessed in numerous laboratory and clinical studies, it has no medical uses established by well-designed clinical research. According to a 2017 review of more than 120 studies, curcumin has not been successful in any clinical trial, leading the authors to conclude that ""curcumin is an unstable, reactive, non-bioavailable compound and, therefore, a highly improbable lead"". Curcumin exhibits numerous interference properties which may lead to misinterpretation of results. The US government has supported US$150 million in research into curcumin through the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, and no support has been found for curcumin as a medical treatment. === Research fraud === Bharat Aggarwal, a former cancer researcher at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had 29 papers retracted due to research fraud as of July 2021. Aggarwal's research had focused on potential anti-cancer properties of herbs and spices, particularly curcumin, and according to a March 2016 article in the Houston Chronicle, ""attracted national media interest and laid the groundwork for ongoing clinical trials"". Aggarwal cofounded a company in 2004 called Curry Pharmaceuticals based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, which planned to develop drugs based on synthetic analogs of curcumin. SignPath Pharma, a company seeking to develop liposomal formulations of curcumin, licensed three patents by Aggarwal related to that approach from MD Anderson in 2013. == FDA warnings about dietary supplements == Between 2018 and 2023, the FDA issued 29 warning letters to American manufacturers of dietary supplements for making false claims of anti-disease effects from using products containing curcumin. In each letter, the FDA stated that the supplement product was not an approved new drug because the ""product is not generally recognized as safe and effective"" for the advertised uses, that ""new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA"", and that the ""FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective"". == Alternative medicine == Though there is no evidence for the safety or efficacy of using curcumin as a therapy, some alternative medicine practitioners give it intravenously, supposedly as a treatment for numerous diseases. In 2017, two serious cases of adverse events were reported from curcumin or turmeric products—one severe allergic reaction and one death—that were caused by administration of a curcumin-polyethylene glycol (PEG40) emulsion product by a naturopath. One treatment caused anaphylaxis leading to death. == Stability == Decontamination of food by ionizing radiation, or food irradiation, is considered a safe and efficient process for elimination of pathogenic bacteria. Ionizing radiation treatment can be applied to either raw materials or ready to eat foods, with some countries, like the United States, imposing limitations on its use. In 2016, laboratory research established and compared the radiosensitivity of three organic food colorants including curcumin, carmine, and annatto to create data to be used for application whenever food products containing these food colors were to undergo the radiation process. The researchers used spectrophotometry and capillary electrophoresis to establish radiosensitivity of the three organic food colorants. Carmine samples were quite stable against radiation treatment, annatto showed limited stability, and curcumin was found to be unstable, particularly when diluted. == References == == External links == Curcumin (Curcuma, Turmeric) and Cancer (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version Medicines containing turmeric or curcumin, risk of liver injury, Safety advisory First draft statement on the potential risk to human health of turmeric and curcumin"	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	{'FO': -0.018314641, 'OD': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' PERSON': -2.7610455e-05, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}
71	Peonidin 3-o-glucoside	PUBMED	 Experimental and clinical studies suggest a positive impact of anthocyanins on bone health; however, the mechanisms of anthocyanins altering the differentiation and function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are not fully understood. This work demonstrates that dietary anthocyanins and resveratrol increased proliferation of cultured human hFOB 1.19 osteoblasts. In addition, treatment of serum starvation of hFOB osteoblasts with anthocyanins and resveratrol at 1.0 μg/ml reduced apoptosis, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, p53, and HDAC1 expression, but increased SIRT1/3 and PGC1α mRNA expression, suggesting mitochondrial and epigenetic regulation. In Sp7/osterix:mCherry transgenic medaka, peonidin-3-O-glucoside and resveratrol increased osteoblast differentiation and increased the expression of Sp7/osterix. Cyanidin, peonidin-3-O-glucoside, and resveratrol also reduced RANKL-induced ectopic osteoclast formation and bone resorption in col10α1:nlGFP/rankl:HSE:CFP medaka in doses of 1-4 μg/ml. The results indicate that both cyanidin and peonidin-3-O-glucoside have anabolic effects on bone, increasing osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and by altering the osteoblast epigenome. Cyanidin and peonidin-3-O-glucoside also reduced RANKL-induced bone resorption in a transgenic medaka model of bone resorption. Thus, peonidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin appear to both increase bone formation and reduce bone loss, suggesting that they be further investigated as potential treatments for osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Anthocyanin is the bioactive compound in black rice, which promotes some health benefits for human body. Present study revealed that black rice anthocyanins improve the biomarker of the metabolic syndrome, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). However, the mechanism of anthocyanin in preventing metabolic syndrome has not been elucidated. This study was performed to identify the interaction of six types of black rice anthocyanin towards TNF-α protein and TNF-α receptor through  We retrieved the black rice anthocyanin compounds from the PubChem database and the proteins (TNF-α protein and TNF-α receptor) from Protein Data Bank (PDB) database. Protein and ligands were docked using Hex 8.0 software and visualized by Discovery Studio 4.1 program. This study found the possibility that black rice anthocyanins interacted with TNF-α have no influence into TNF-α and TNF-α receptor interaction. The binding of delphinidin-3-O-glucoside & peonidin-3-O-glucoside to TNF-α receptor inhibited the TNF-α and TNF-α receptor signaling. The black rice anthocyanins had low activity as a drug. Interestingly, black rice anthocyanins had a potency as an antioxidant due to the hydrogen donor or acceptor in their structure, as protein kinase inhibitor, nuclear receptor ligand, and enzyme kinase inhibitor. This study suggests that delphinidin-3-O-glucoside and peonidin-3-O-glucoside might have function as anti-inflammatory factor related with TNF-α signaling. A frequent chronic liver condition across the world is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oxidative stress caused by lipid accumulation is generally considered to be the main cause of NAFLD. Anthocyanins can effectively inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species and improve oxidative stress. In this work, six major anthocyanins were separated from purple corncob by semi-preparative liquid chromatography. The effects of the 6 kinds of anthocyanins against NAFLD were investigated using a free fatty acid (FFA)-induced cell model. The results showed that peonidin 3-O-glucoside (P3G) can significantly reduce lipid accumulation in the NAFLD cell model. The treatment with P3G also inhibited oxidative stress via inhibiting the excessive production of reactive oxygen species and superoxide anion, increasing glutathione levels, and enhancing the activities of SOD, GPX, and CAT. Further studies unveiled that treatment with P3G not only alleviated inflammation but also improved the depletion of mitochondrial content and damage of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain developed concomitantly in the cell model. P3G upregulated transcription factor EB (TFEB)-mediated lysosomal function and activated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα)-mediated peroxisomal lipid oxidation by interacting with PPARα possibly. Overall, this study added to our understanding of the protective effects of purple corn anthocyanins against NAFLD and offered suggestions for developing functional foods containing these anthocyanins.

76	Forskolin	WIKIPEDIA	"Forskolin (coleonol) is a labdane diterpene produced by the plant Coleus barbatus (blue spur flower). Other names include pashanabhedi, Indian coleus, makandi, HL-362, mao hou qiao rui hua. As with other members of the large diterpene class of plant metabolites, forskolin is derived from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Forskolin contains some unique functional elements, including the presence of a tetrahydropyran-derived heterocyclic ring. Forskolin is commonly used in laboratory research to increase levels of cyclic AMP by stimulation of adenylate cyclase. == Mechanism of action == Forskolin is used in biochemistry experiments to raise levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in studies of cell physiology. Forskolin activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and increases intracellular levels of cAMP. cAMP is an important second messenger necessary for the proper biological response of cells to hormones and other extracellular signals. It is required for cell communication in the hypothalamus-pituitary gland axis, and for the feedback control of hormones via induction of corticotropin-releasing factor gene transcription. Cyclic AMP acts by activating cAMP-sensitive pathways such as protein kinase A and EPAC1. == Chemistry == It is defined as a category 4 chemical with acute dermal toxicity based on 2012 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). === Derivatives === Its derivatives include colforsin daropate, NKH477, and FSK88, which may be more potent than forskolin at raising cAMP. These derivatives may have pharmaceutical utility against bronchoconstriction and heart failure. === Chemical synthesis === A total chemical synthesis has been reported. The key step of this chemical synthesis is photocyclization of a synthetic intermediate in presence of oxygen and methylene blue, followed by a singlet oxygen Diels-Alder reaction. == Biosynthesis == The heterocyclic ring is synthesized after the formation of the trans-fused carbon ring systems formed by a carbocation mediated cyclization. The remaining tertiary carbocation is quenched by a molecule of water. After deprotonation, the remaining hydroxy group is free to form the heterocyclic ring. This cyclization can occur either by attack of the alcohol oxygen onto the allylic carbocation formed by loss of diphosphate, or by an analogous SN2'-like displacement of the diphosphate. This forms the core ring system A of forskolin. The remaining modifications of the core ring system A can putatively be understood as a series of oxidation reactions to form a poly-ol B which is then further oxidized and esterified to form the ketone and acetate ester moieties seen in forskolin. However, because the biosynthetic gene cluster has not been described, this putative synthesis could be incorrect in the sequence of oxidation/esterification events, which could occur in almost any order. == Weight loss == Although forskolin has been used in preliminary weight loss research, the low quality of the studies and inconclusive results prevented any determination of effects. == See also == Adenylyl cyclase Cyclic AMP == References == == External links == Hall, Harriet (2014-06-03).

78	Lyso pc (16:1)	PUBMED	 The identification of cancer biomarkers is critical for target-linked cancer therapy. The overall level of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is elevated in colorectal cancer (CRC). To investigate which species of PC is overexpressed in colorectal cancer, an imaging mass spectrometry was performed using a panel of non-neoplastic mucosal and CRC tissues. In the present study, we identified a novel biomarker, PC(16:0/16:1), in CRC using imaging mass spectrometry. Specifically, elevated levels of PC(16:0/16:1) expression were observed in the more advanced stage of CRC. Our data further showed that PC(16:0/16:1) was specifically localized in the cancer region when examined using imaging mass spectrometry. Notably, because the ratio of PC(16:0/16:1) to lyso-PC(16:0) was higher in CRC, we postulated that lyso-PC acyltransferase (LPCAT) activity is elevated in CRC. In an in vitro analysis, we showed that LPCAT4 is involved in the deregulation of PC(16:0/16:1) in CRC. In an immunohistochemical analysis, LPCAT4 was shown to be overexpressed in CRC. These data indicate the potential usefulness of PC(16:0/16:1) for the clinical diagnosis of CRC and implicate LPCAT4 in the elevated expression of PC(16:0/16:1) in CRC.

80	Melezitose	WIKIPEDIA	Melezitose, also spelled melicitose, is a nonreducing trisaccharide sugar that is produced by many plant sap eating insects, including aphids such as Cinara pilicornis, by an enzyme reaction. This is beneficial to the insects, as it reduces the stress of osmosis by reducing their own water potential. The melezitose is part of the honeydew which acts as an attractant for ants and also as a food for bees although it is not easily digestible by bees. This is useful to the aphids as they have a symbiotic relationship with ants. Melezitose can be partially hydrolyzed to glucose and turanose the latter of which is an isomer of sucrose. == References ==	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -1.9361265e-07, 'OD': 0.0}
81	Hirsutenone	PUBMED	 Although specific compounds found in some East Asian traditional medicines have been shown to exhibit bioactive properties, their molecular mechanisms of action remain elusive. The bark of the Alnus species has been used for the treatment of various pathological conditions including hemorrhage, alcoholism, fever, diarrhea, skin diseases, inflammation, and cancer in East Asia for centuries. In this study, we show that hirsutenone, a bioactive compound in Alnus japonica, exhibits anti-cancer effects against prostate cancer through a direct physical inhibition of Akt1/2. Hirsutenone suppressed anchorage-dependent and independent cell growth of PC3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Annexin V and Propidium iodide (PI) staining results demonstrated that hirsutenone strongly induces apoptotic cell death in both PC3 and LNCaP cells. Furthermore, treatment of hirsutenone attenuated phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream substrate of Akt, without affecting Akt phosphorylation. Kinase and pull-down assay results clearly show that hirsutenone inhibits Akt1 and 2 by direct binding in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-noncompetitive manner in vitro and ex vivo. Our results show that hirsutenone suppresses human prostate cancer by targeting Akt1 and 2 as a key component to explain for anti-cancer activity of Alnus species. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether hirsutenone affects the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) K(+) channels. Many drugs promote formation of the acquired form of long QT syndrome (LQTS) by blocking the hERG K(+) channels. Hirsutenone, a new candidate for the treatment inflammatory skin lesions, induced a concentration-dependent decrease in hERG K(+) current amplitudes. Hirsutenone significantly decreased the time constants at the onset of inactivation. However, the reductions in the time constants of steady-state inactivation and the recovery from inactivation after hirsutenone treatment were not significant. In addition, the drug had no effect on the voltage-dependent activation curve or the steady-state inactivation curve. In summary, hirsutenone potentially acts as a blocker of hERG K(+) channels functioning by modifying the channel inactivation kinetics. Adipogenesis is a key driver of the expansion of adipose tissue mass that causes obesity. Hirsutenone (HST) is an active botanical diarylheptanoid present in Alnus species. In this study, we evaluated the effects of HST on adipogenesis, its mechanisms of action and the molecular targets involved. Using Oil Red O staining, we observed that HST dose-dependently suppresses lipid accumulation during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, concomitant with a decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) protein expression. This inhibitory effect was largely limited to the early stage of adipogenesis, which includes mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), as evidenced by delayed cell cycle entry of preadipocytes from G1 to S phase. Furthermore, the regulation of MCE was accompanied by suppression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. HST was also shown to bind directly to PI3K and ERK1 in a non-ATP competitive manner. Our results suggest that HST attenuates adipogenesis by directly targeting PI3K and ERK during MCE in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, underscoring the potential therapeutic application of HST in preventing obesity.

83	Tryptophan	WIKIPEDIA	"Tryptophan (symbol Trp or W) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan contains an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a polar molecule with a non-polar aromatic beta carbon substituent. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3 (niacin). It is encoded by the codon UGG. Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (–NH+3; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( –COO−; pKa = 2.38). Humans and many animals cannot synthesize tryptophan: they need to obtain it through their diet, making it an essential amino acid. Tryptophan is named after the digestive enzymes trypsin, which were used in its first isolation from casein proteins. It was assigned the one-letter symbol W based on the double ring being visually suggestive to the bulky letter. == Function == Amino acids, including tryptophan, are used as building blocks in protein biosynthesis, and proteins are required to sustain life. Tryptophan is among the less common amino acids found in proteins, but it plays important structural or functional roles whenever it occurs. For instance, tryptophan and tyrosine residues play special roles in ""anchoring"" membrane proteins within the cell membrane. Tryptophan, along with other aromatic amino acids, is also important in glycan-protein interactions. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds: Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase. Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes. Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids. Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan. The disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression. In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop, and when the cell's tryptophan levels go down again, transcription from the trp operon resumes. This permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell's internal and external tryptophan levels. == Recommended dietary allowance == In 2002, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5 mg/kg body weight/day of tryptophan for adults 19 years and over. === Dietary sources === Tryptophan is present in most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan, the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry. == Medical use == === Depression === Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. In 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that ""the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive"" and note that ""because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present"". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence. === Insomnia === The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of tryptophan in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness. == Side effects == Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). == Interactions == Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs. Because tryptophan supplementation has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, its interactions with other drugs are not well known. == Isolation == The isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901. Hopkins recovered tryptophan from hydrolysed casein, recovering 4–8 g of tryptophan from 600 g of crude casein. == Biosynthesis and industrial production == As an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins. Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerol phosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine. The industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified bacteria such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, C. glutamicum or E. coli. These strains carry mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase. == Society and culture == === Showa Denko contamination scandal === There was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit. Subsequent studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko's L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. However, other evidence suggests that tryptophan itself may be a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. There are also claims that a precursor reached sufficient concentrations to form a toxic dimer. The FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005. The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of L-tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been cited as evidence of a need for ""close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products"". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech. === Turkey meat and drowsiness hypothesis === A common assertion in the US and the UK is that heavy consumption of turkey meat—as seen during Thanksgiving and Christmas—results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable with that of other meats. Drowsiness after eating may be caused by other foods eaten with the turkey, particularly carbohydrates. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan, into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in more uptake of tryptophan across the blood–brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into the hormone melatonin—which is an important mediator of the circadian rhythm—by the pineal gland. Hence, these data suggest that ""feast-induced drowsiness""—or postprandial somnolence—may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which indirectly increases the production of melatonin in the brain, and thereby promotes sleep. == Research == === Yeast amino acid metabolism === In 1912 Felix Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast metabolizes the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol. === Serotonin precursor === Tryptophan affects brain serotonin synthesis when given orally in a purified form and is used to modify serotonin levels for research. Low brain serotonin level is induced by administration of tryptophan-poor protein in a technique called acute tryptophan depletion. Studies using this method have evaluated the effect of serotonin on mood and social behavior, finding that serotonin reduces aggression and increases agreeableness. === Psychedelic effects === Tryptophan produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at sufficiently high doses. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects. Tryptophan is converted into the trace amine tryptamine and tryptamine is N-methylated by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) into N-methyltryptamine (NMT) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT), which are known serotonergic psychedelics. === Fluorescence === Tryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of the microenvironment around the tryptophan residue. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of tryptophan residues. == See also == 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) α-Methyltryptophan Acree–Rosenheim reaction Adamkiewicz reaction Attenuator (genetics) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine Hopkins–Cole reaction Serotonin Tryptamine == References == == Further reading == == External links =="	FOOD, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.015812866, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': -1.9361265e-07, ',': -2.9352968e-06, ' FOOD': -0.0037580363, ' MED': -1.5451682e-05, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07}
85	Dioctyl sulfosuccinate	PUBMED	 Constipation has many definitions and is often described differently depending on the population queried. Many physicians define constipation as a reduction in the frequency of bowel movements to fewer than three times per week while patients identify more with the symptoms associated with constipation such as difficulty passing stool, hard stool consistency, feelings of abdominal cramping, and feelings of incomplete stool passage. Causes of constipation may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to other factors such as diet, medication, or medical conditions. Constipation can affect anyone as a minor annoyance but up to a quarter of the population experiences it chronically or severely. It can substantially affect quality of life and be debilitating. It is estimated that between 2% to 27% of the population are affected depending upon the definition of constipation used. Chronic constipation is a significant problem in the elderly,, in patients with chronic conditions,– and in patients receiving opioids as part of a treatment regimen.– Up to 20% suffer from chronic constipation in the community-dwelling elderly population while this number increases to approximately 50% to 75% in institutionalized elderly patients. Approximately 90% of patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain suffer from constipation with this number rising to 95% in patients treated for cancer pain. Chronic constipation can be defined using any one of three options: the Rome III criteria for functional constipation, the American College of Gastroenterology definition, or the American Gastroenterological Association definition. Current treatment options include dietary or bulking agents (i.e. psyllium seed husk), osmotic laxatives (i.e. lactulose, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol [PEG]), stimulant laxatives (i.e. sennosides, bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate), and stool softeners (i.e. docusate sodium or calcium)., In North America, docusate and a stimulant laxative such as sennosides are commonly used in bowel treatment protocols associated with institutionalized elderly and oncology treatments. A paucity of evidence is available to support the use of the stool softener docusate yet it continues to be prescribed in everyday clinical practice for the aforementioned populations.– While the actual cost of docusate is low, additional costs associated with its administration (i.e. nursing time) and its widespread use can be significant. Therefore, this review was undertaken to determine the clinical effectiveness of docusate for the prevention or management of constipation. Reverse micelle (RM) aggregates have a wide range of applications in various areas of science and technology. A continuous demand exists to replace interfacial surfactant molecules with various nonconventional amphiphiles. Ionic liquid (IL)-like surfactants (IL-surf's) constitute a class of such molecules that are being researched extensively. Here, we have formulated several water/IL-surf/oil microemulsions by optimizing the core droplet size with varying oil phases. The best composition of water/[BMIM][AOT]/IPM ([BMIM][AOT]: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dioctyl sulfosuccinate; IPM: isopropyl myristate) was then analyzed in detail through experimental and computer simulations. Our results from DLS measurements suggest a structural transition from spherical aggregates in the parent water/[Na][AOT]/IPM solution to cylindrical droplets in the IL-surf-based system. The Raman and ATR-FTIR spectral analysis suggest a variation in the microstructure of the water/oil interface due to the differential interaction of the counterions with AOT headgroups and water. Molecular dynamics simulation results provided the direct image of the interface showing a structured versus uneven water/oil interface in [Na][AOT] versus [BMIM][AOT] RMs, where the larger [BMIM] cations weakly bind with the AOT headgroups due to their low charge density. Finally, an application of this IL-surf-based formulation was tested by carrying out a Heck cross-coupling reaction that showed significantly higher yield under milder reaction conditions. Due to the relatively high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in oil samples, oil spills in aquatic ecosystems release significant amounts of PAHs. Although remediation efforts often take place during or immediately after an oil spill incident, a portion of the released PAHs remains in the body of water. A natural phenomenon resulting from the direct exposure of PAHs to sunlight is photodegradation. This article investigates the effect of dioctyl sulfosuccinate (DOSS) on the photodegradation of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), the most toxic PAH in the priority pollutants list of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). DOSS is a surfactant typically used in the remediation of oil spills. Three lamps with maximum emission wavelengths at 350 nm, 419 nm, and 575 nm were individually and simultaneously used to irradiate aqueous solutions of BaP in the absence and the presence of DOSS. When irradiated with the 419 nm lamp or the 575 lamp, BaP showed no photodegradation. Upon irradiation with the 350 nm lamp and with the simultaneous use of the three lamps, the photodegradation of BaP followed first-order kinetics. Independent of the irradiation wavelength, the presence of DOSS increased the half-life of BaP in the aqueous solution. In the case of the 350 nm lamp, the rate constant of photodegradation in the absence and the presence of DOSS varied from (3.79 ± 0.97) × 10	MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL	INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL	{'IND': -0.55111957, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0, ',': -0.051801633, ' MED': -0.016671281, 'ICAL': 0.0}
86	Coenzyme q10	PUBMED	 World population growth and aging are posing unprecedented challenges in sustaining the health of 9.1 billion people that will be occupying the planet by 2050. Although noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and diabetes are among the top 10 global causes of death, they can be prevented by risk factor reduction, early detection, and adequate treatment. Since a healthy diet along with dietary supplementation could play an important role to reduce morbidity and cut off its associated health care costs, research in the food and nutrition area is required to find solutions to global challenges affecting health. As a result of the healthy living trend, dietary supplements category is growing fast, leading to an urgent need for dietitians, physicians, and policy makers to broaden the scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of a wide range of active ingredients. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), as the third most consumed dietary supplement, and as a potential candidate for the treatment of various noncommunicable diseases that are among the global top 10 causes of death, has gained interest over years. Scientific evidence regarding mainly CoQ10 efficacy and safety, as well as formulation challenges, is addressed in this review. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) or ubiquinone was known for its key role in mitochondrial bioenergetics as electron and proton carrier; later studies demonstrated its presence in other cellular membranes and in blood plasma, and extensively investigated its antioxidant role. These two functions constitute the basis for supporting the clinical indication of CoQ10. Furthermore, recent data indicate that CoQ10 affects expression of genes involved in human cell signalling, metabolism and transport and some of the effects of CoQ10 supplementation may be due to this property. CoQ10 deficiencies are due to autosomal recessive mutations, mitochondrial diseases, ageing-related oxidative stress and carcinogenesis processes, and also a secondary effect of statin treatment. Many neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, cancer, fibromyalgia, muscular and cardiovascular diseases have been associated with low CoQ10 levels. CoQ10 treatment does not cause serious adverse effects in humans and new formulations have been developed that increase CoQ10 absorption and tissue distribution. Oral CoQ10 treatment is a frequent mitochondrial energizer and antioxidant strategy in many diseases that may provide a significant symptomatic benefit. Coenzyme Q10, or ubiquinone, is a non-prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat-soluble molecule that acts as an electron carrier in mitochondria, and as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes. Coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be associated with a multitude of diseases, including heart failure. The severity of heart failure correlates with the severity of coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Emerging data suggest that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species are increased in people with heart failure, and coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects because of its antioxidant activity. Coenzyme Q10 may also have a role in stabilising myocardial calcium-dependent ion channels, and in preventing the consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Coenzyme Q10, although not a primary recommended treatment, could be beneficial to people with heart failure. Several randomised controlled trials have compared coenzyme Q10 to other therapeutic modalities, but no systematic review of existing randomised trials was conducted prior to the original version of this Cochrane Review, in 2014. To review the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and AMED on 16 October 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 July 2020, and the ISRCTN Registry on 11 November 2019. We applied no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials of either parallel or cross-over design that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. When we identified cross-over studies, we considered data only from the first phase. We used standard Cochrane methods, assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR); for continuous data, the mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate data were available, we conducted meta-analysis. When meta-analysis was not possible, we wrote a narrative synthesis. We provided a PRISMA flow chart to show the flow of study selection. We included eleven studies, with 1573 participants, comparing coenzyme Q10 to placebo or conventional therapy (control). In the majority of the studies, sample size was relatively small. There were important differences among studies in daily coenzyme Q10 dose, follow-up period, and the measures of treatment effect. All studies had unclear, or high risk of bias, or both, in one or more bias domains. We were only able to conduct meta-analysis for some of the outcomes. None of the included trials considered quality of life, measured on a validated scale, exercise variables (exercise haemodynamics), or cost-effectiveness. Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of all-cause mortality more than control (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.95; 1 study, 420 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 13.3; moderate-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence of inconclusive results between the coenzyme Q10 and control groups for the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.59; 1 study, 420 participants), and stroke (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.48; 1 study, 420 participants). Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces hospitalisation related to heart failure (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78; 2 studies, 1061 participants; NNTB 9.7; moderate-quality evidence). Very low-quality evidence suggests that coenzyme Q10 may improve the left ventricular ejection fraction (MD 1.77, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.44; 7 studies, 650 participants), but the results are inconclusive for exercise capacity (MD 48.23, 95% CI -24.75 to 121.20; 3 studies, 91 participants); and the risk of developing adverse events (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 2 studies, 568 participants). We downgraded the quality of the evidence mainly due to high risk of bias and imprecision. The included studies provide moderate-quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure. There is low-quality evidence of inconclusive results as to whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on the risk of myocardial infarction, or stroke. Because of very low-quality evidence, it is very uncertain whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on either left ventricular ejection fraction or exercise capacity. There is low-quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 may increase the risk of adverse effects, or have little to no difference. There is currently no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure. Future trials are needed to confirm our findings.

87	Cholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Cholic acid, also known as 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid is a primary bile acid that is insoluble in water (soluble in alcohol and acetic acid), it is a white crystalline substance. Salts of cholic acid are called cholates. Cholic acid, along with chenodeoxycholic acid, is one of the two major bile acids produced by the liver, where it is synthesized from cholesterol. These two major bile acids are roughly equal in concentration in humans. Derivatives are made from cholyl-CoA, which exchanges its CoA with either glycine, or taurine, yielding glycocholic and taurocholic acid, respectively. Cholic acid downregulates cholesterol-7-α-hydroxylase (rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis), and cholesterol does the opposite. This is why chenodeoxycholic acid, and not cholic acid, can be used to treat gallstones (because decreasing bile acid synthesis would supersaturate the stones even more). Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are the most important human bile acids. Other species may synthesize different bile acids as their predominant primary bile acids. == Medical uses == Cholic acid, sold under the brand name Cholbam, is approved for use in the United States and is indicated as a treatment for children and adults with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for peroxisomal disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. It was approved for use in the European Union in September 2013, and is sold under the brand name Orphacol. It is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile-acid synthesis due to 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency in infants, children and adolescents aged one month to 18 years and adults. Cholic acid FGK (Kolbam) was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2015. It is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis, in infants from one month of age for continuous lifelong treatment through adulthood, encompassing the following single enzyme defects: sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, CTX); 2- (or alpha-) methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency; cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) deficiency. The most common side effects include peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet), diarrhea, nausea (feeling sick), acid reflux (stomach acid flowing up into the mouth), esophagitis (inflammation of the food pipe), jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), skin problems (lesions) and malaise (feeling unwell). == Interactive pathway map == Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. == References ==	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	{'MED': -0.41026816, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' EN': -1.4021238e-05, 'DO': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
88	Prazepam	WIKIPEDIA	"Prazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative drug developed by Warner-Lambert in the 1960s. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Prazepam is a prodrug for desmethyldiazepam which is responsible for the therapeutic effects of prazepam. == Indications == Prazepam is indicated for the short-term treatment of anxiety. After short-term therapy, the dose is usually gradually tapered-off to reduce or avoid any withdrawal or rebound effects. Desmethyldiazepam, an active metabolite, has a very long half-life of 29 to 224 hours, which contributes to the therapeutic effects of prazepam. == Side effects == Side effects of prazepam are less profound than with other benzodiazepines. Excessive drowsiness and with longer-term use, drug dependence, are the most common side effects of prazepam. Side effects such as fatigue or ""feeling spacey"" can also occur but less commonly than with other benzodiazepines. Other side effects include feebleness, clumsiness or lethargy, clouded thinking and mental slowness. == Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal == Tolerance and dependence can develop with long-term use of prazepam, and upon cessation or reduction in dosage, then a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur with symptoms such as tremulousness, dysphoria, psychomotor agitation, tachycardia and sweating. In severe cases, hallucinations, psychosis and seizures can occur. Withdrawal-related psychosis is generally unresponsive to antipsychotic mediations. The risk and severity of the withdrawal syndrome increases the higher the dose and the longer prazepam is taken for. Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal problems may be less severe than with other benzodiazepines, such as diazepam. It may be because tolerance is slower to develop with prazepam than with other benzodiazepines. Abrupt or over-rapid discontinuation of prazepam after long-term use, even at low dosage, may result in a protracted withdrawal syndrome. Benzodiazepines can induce serious problems of addiction, which is one of the main reasons for their use being restricted to short-term use. A survey in Senegal found that the majority of doctors believed that their training in this area was generally poor. It was recommended that national authorities take urgent action regarding the rational use of benzodiazepines. Almost one-fifth of doctors ignored prescription guidelines regarding short-term use of benzodiazepines, and almost three-quarters of doctors regarded their training and knowledge of benzodiazepines to be inadequate. More training regarding benzodiazepines has been recommended for doctors. == Contraindications and special caution == Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. == Mechanism of action == Prazepam exerts its therapeutic effects primarily via modulating the benzodiazepine receptor which in turn enhances GABA function in the brain. Prazepam like other benzodiazepines has anticonvulsant properties, but its anticonvulsant properties are not as potent as other benzodiazepines when tested in animal studies. == Pharmacokinetics == Prazepam is metabolised into descyclopropylmethylprazepam (also known as desmethyldiazepam) and 3-hydroxyprazepam which is further metabolised into oxazepam. Prazepam is a prodrug for descyclopropylmethylprazepam/desmethyldiazepam (also known as norprazepam or nordazepam) which is responsible for most of the therapeutic activity of prazepam rather than prazepam itself. == Interactions == Prazepam may interact with cimetidine. Alcohol in combination with prazepam increases the adverse effects, particularly performance impairing side effects and drowsiness. == Overdose == The symptoms of an overdose of prazepam include sleepiness, agitation and ataxia. Hypotonia may also occur in severe cases. Overdoses in children typically result in more severe symptoms of overdose. == Abuse potential == Prazepam like other benzodiazepines has abuse potential and can be habit forming. However, its abuse potential may be lower than other benzodiazepines because it has a slow onset of action. == Toxicity == Animal studies have found prazepam taken during pregnancy results in delayed growth and causes reproductive abnormalities. == Trade names == Common trade names include Centrac, Centrax, Demetrin, Lysanxia, Mono Demetrin, Pozapam, Prasepine, Prazene, Reapam and Trepidan. Trade names vary depending on the country; Austria: Demetrin, Belgium: Lysanxia, France: Lysanxia, Germany: Demetrin; Mono Demetrin, Greece: Centrac, Ireland: Centrax, Italy: Prazene; Trepidan, Macedonia: Demetrin, Prazepam, Netherlands: Reapam, Portugal: Demetrin, South Africa: Demetrin, Switzerland: Demetrin, Thailand: Pozapam; Prasepine. == See also == Benzodiazepine Benzodiazepine dependence Long-term effects of benzodiazepines == References == == External links == Inchem – Prazepam"	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
90	Xanthohumol	WIKIPEDIA	Xanthohumol is a natural product found in the female inflorescences of Humulus lupulus, also known as hops. This compound is also found in beer and belongs to a class of compounds that contribute to the bitterness and flavor of hops. Xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid, biosynthesized by a type III polyketide synthase (PKS) and subsequent modifying enzymes. == Biosynthesis == Xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid derived from a plant type III PKS, and is synthesized in the glandular trichromes of hop cones. L-Phenylalanine serves as the starting material, which is converted to cinnamic acid by the PLP-dependent phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Cinnamic acid is oxidized by cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and loaded onto Coenzyme A (CoA) by 4-coumarate CoA ligase to yield 4-hydroxy-cinnamoyl CoA, the starter unit for PKS extension. This molecule is extended three times with malonyl CoA, cyclized through a Claisen condensation, and aromatized through tautomerization to form naringenin chalcone (chalconaringenin). This intermediate has the potential to form a variety of different products depending on the enzymes that modify the core structure. In the case of xanthohumol, a prenyltransferase called Humulus lupulus prenyltransferase 1 (HlPT-1) attaches a molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate from the DXP pathway. HlPT-1 has a broad substrate specificity and also participates in making other prenylated flavonoids in the hop plant. Finally, an O-methyltransferase methylates a phenol substituent using S-adenosyl methionine. Total syntheses of xanthohumol and derivatives have been achieved, though extraction from hops remains a primary source. == Beer == In commercial beers, the concentration of xanthohumol ranges from about 2 μg/L – 1.2 mg/L. During the brewing process, xanthohumol and other prenylated flavonoids are lost as they are converted to the corresponding flavanones. Different hop varieties and different beers contain varying quantities of xanthohumol. == Research == Xanthohumol is under basic research for its potential biological properties. Xanthohumol can be extracted with pressurized hot water. == See also == Isoxanthohumol, the corresponding prenylated flavanone 8-Prenylnaringenin, a related prenylflavanoid with estrogenic activity Alpha acids, a class of bitter compounds in hops Myrcene, humulene, and caryophyllene, essential oils in hops == References ==	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -4.723352e-06, 'OD': 0.0}
91	Enoxolone	WIKIPEDIA	"Enoxolone (INN, BAN; also known as glycyrrhetinic acid or glycyrrhetic acid) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid derivative of the beta-amyrin type obtained from the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizic acid, which was obtained from the herb liquorice. The substance has a sweet taste, so it is used in flavoring to mask the bitter taste of drugs like aloe and quinine. It may have some anti-inflammatory activities. One of its metabolites is responsible for the blood pressure-increasing effect of liquorice. == Medical uses == === Oral topical === In Turkey, enoxolone is used in a ""Anzibel"" lozenge in combination with benzocaine (a local anesthetic) and chlorhexidine hydrochloride (an antibacterial). It is found in an over-the-counter ""Arthrodont"" toothpaste. Evidence for the ingredient's usefulness for plaque and gingivitis is lacking. === Skin topical === In Japan, enoxolone is found in the ""Salonpas"" pain-relief menthol patch. It is also used in the Singaporean ""Vetic"" cream. In the United States, it is found in PruClair, a ""precription medical device"" indicated for generic dermatoses. === Possible other uses === Enoxolone is effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer and also has expectorant (antitussive) properties. It has some additional pharmacological properties with possible antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antibacterial activities. == Mechanism of action == === Anti-inflammatory === Glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits the enzymes (15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and delta-13-prostaglandin) that metabolize the prostaglandins PGE-2 and PGF-2α to their respective, inactive 15-keto-13,14-dihydro metabolites. This increases prostaglandins in the digestive system. Prostaglandins inhibit gastric secretion, stimulate pancreatic secretion and mucous secretion in the intestines, and markedly increase intestinal motility. They also cause cell proliferation in the stomach. The effect on gastric acid secretion, and promotion of mucous secretion and cell proliferation shows why licorice has potential in treating peptic ulcers. Licorice should not be taken during pregnancy, because PGF-2α stimulates activity of the uterus during pregnancy and can cause abortion. ds The structure of glycyrrhetinic acid is similar to that of cortisone. Both molecules are flat and similar at positions 3 and 11. This might be the basis for licorice's anti-inflammatory action. === Hypertensive === 3-β-D-(Monoglucuronyl)-18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid, a metabolite of glycyrrhetinic acid, inhibits the conversion of 'active' cortisol to 'inactive' cortisone in the kidneys. This occurs via inhibition of the enzyme 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. As a result, cortisol levels become high within the collecting duct of the kidney. Cortisol has intrinsic mineralocorticoid properties (that is, it acts like aldosterone and increases sodium reabsorption) that work on ENaC channels in the collecting duct. Hypertension develops due to this mechanism of sodium retention. People often have high blood pressure with a low renin and low aldosterone blood level. The increased amounts of cortisol binds to the unprotected, nonspecific mineralocorticoid receptors and induce sodium and fluid retention, hypokalaemia, high blood pressure, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Therefore, licorice should not be given to patients with a known history of hypertension in doses sufficient to inhibit 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. == Derivatives == In glycyrrhetinic acid, the functional group (R) is a hydroxyl group. Research in 2005 demonstrated that with a proper functional group a very effective glycyrrhetinic artificial sweetener can be obtained. When R is an anionic NHCO(CH2)CO2K side chain, the sweetening effect is found to be 1200 times that of sugar (human sensory panel data). A shorter or longer spacer reduces the sweetening effect. One explanation is that the taste bud cell receptor has 1.3 nanometers (13 angstroms) available for docking with the sweetener molecule. In addition, the sweetener molecule requires three proton donor positions, of which two reside at the extremities, to be able to interact efficiently with the receptor cavity. A synthetic analog, carbenoxolone, was developed in Britain. Both glycyrrhetinic acid and carbenoxolone have a modulatory effect on neural signaling through gap junction channels. Acetoxolone, the acetyl derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid, is a drug used in the treatment of peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease. == See also == 11α-Hydroxyprogesterone == References == == Further reading == Saponin Glycosides Archived 2021-01-26 at the Wayback Machine, by Georges-Louis Friedli, URL accessed Sept 2010. == External links == Media related to Enoxolone at Wikimedia Commons"	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	{'MED': -0.00019650738, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07, ',': -1.504853e-06, ' PERSON': -0.123372175, 'AL': -1.2664457e-06, ' CARE': 0.0}
92	9-octadecenamide	WIKIPEDIA	"Oleamide is an organic compound with the formula CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7CONH2. It is the amide derived from the fatty acid oleic acid. It is a colorless waxy solid and occurs in nature. Sometimes labeled as a fatty acid primary amide (FAPA), it is biosynthesized from N-oleoylglycine. == Biochemical and medical aspects == In terms of natural occurrence, oleamide was first detected in human plasma. It was later shown to accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid during sleep deprivation and induces sleep in animals. It has been considered as a treatment for mood and sleep disorders, as well as cannabinoid-regulated depression. In terms of its sleep inducing effects, it is speculated that oleamide interacts with multiple neurotransmitter systems. Some in-vitro studies show that cis-oleamide is an agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB-1 with an affinity around 8 micromolar. However, given oleamide's relatively low affinity for CB-1 and uncertainty about the concentration and biological role of oleamide in-vivo, it has been argued that it is premature to classify oleamide as an endocannabinoid. At larger doses oleamide can lower the body temperature of mice by about 2 degrees, with the effect lasting about two hours. The mechanism for this remains unknown. Oleamide has been found to enhance PPARα-dependent increase in doublecortin, a marker of neurogenesis in the hippocampus Oleamide is rapidly metabolized by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the same enzyme that metabolizes anandamide. It has been postulated that some effects of oleamide are caused by increased concentrations of anandamide brought about through the inhibition of FAAH. It has been claimed that oleamide increases the activity of choline acetyltransferase, an enzyme that is critical in the production of acetylcholine. == Other occurrences == Oleamide has been found in Ziziphus jujuba, also known as Jujube fruit. Synthetic oleamide has a variety of industrial uses, including as a lubricant. Oleamide was found to be leaching out of polypropylene plastics in laboratory experiments, affecting experimental results. Since polypropylene is used in a wide number of food containers such as those for yogurt, the problem is being studied. Oleamide is ""one of the most frequent non-cannabinoid ingredients associated with Spice products."" Analysis of 44 products synthetic cannabinoid revealed oleamide in 7 of the products tested. == See also == Anandamide Fatty acid amide hydrolase Virodhamine == References =="	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL	{'MED': -0.70372576, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.009092058, ' FOOD': -0.2647525, ' PERSON': -0.1362794, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0, ' IND': -3.2929079e-06, 'UST': -1.9361265e-07, 'RI': 0.0}
93	Felodipine	WIKIPEDIA	Felodipine is a medication of the calcium channel blocker type that is used to treat high blood pressure. It was patented in 1978, and approved for medical use in 1988. == Medical uses == Felodipine is used to treat high blood pressure and stable angina. It should not be used for people who are pregnant, have acute heart failure, are having a heart attack, have an obstructed heart valve, or have obstructions that block bloodflow out of the heart. For people with liver failure the dose needs to be lowered, because felodipine is cleared by the liver. == Adverse effects == The only very common side effect, occurring in more than 1/10 people, is pain and swelling in the arms and legs. Common side effects, occurring in between 1% and 10% of people, include flushing, headache, heart palpitations, dizziness and fatigue. Felodipine can exacerbate gingivitis. == Interactions == Felodipine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, so substances that inhibit or activate CYP3A4 can strongly effect how much felodipine is present. CYP3A4 inhibitors, which increase the amount of felodipine available per dose, include cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, and grapefruit juice. CYP3A4 activators, which decrease the amount of felodipine available per dose, include phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates, efavirenz, nevirapine, and Saint John's wort. == Mechanism of action == Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker. Felodipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid. Different calcium channels are present in vascular tissue and cardiac tissue; an in vitro study on human vascular and cardiac tissues comparing how selective various calcium channel blockers are for vascular compared to cardiac tissue found the following vascular/cardiac tissue ratios: mibefradil 41, felodipine 12; nifedipine 7, amlodipine 5, and verapamil 0.2.: 172 == Chemistry == Felodipine is a member of the 1,4-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers.: 20–21 It is a racemic mixture, and is insoluble in water but is soluble in dichloromethane and ethanol.: 25 == History == The Swedish company Hässle, a division of Astra AB, discovered felodipine; it filed a patent application in 1979 claiming felodipine as an antihypertensive drug. Astra partnered this drug and others with Merck & Co. in the US under a 1982 agreement between the companies. The drug was approved by the FDA in 1991 after a three-and-a-half-year review; the drug entered a very crowded market to included the other calcium channel blockers nifedipine, verapamil, nicardipine, and isradipine. The FDA gave the drug a 1C rating, meaning that it found little difference between felodipine and the drugs already approved for the same use. In 1994 Astra AB and Merck changed their partnership to a joint venture called Astra Merck, and in 1998 Astra (by that time, AstraZeneca) bought out Merck's rights in the joint venture. The first generics became available in Sweden in 2003 and in the US in 2004.: 155 In April 2016, AstraZeneca announced that they were selling the right to market felodipine in China to China Medical System Holdings for $310 million; AZ would continue to manufacture the drug. == Society and culture == As of 2016, felodipine was marketed under many brand names worldwide: Auronal, Cardioplen, Catrazil, Dewei, Dilahex, Enfelo, Erding, Fedil, Fedisyn, Feldil, Felicipin, Felo, Felocard, Felocor, Feloday, Felodil, Felodin, Felodip, Felodipin, Felodipina, Felodipine, Felodipino, Felodistad, Felogard, Felohexal, Felop, Felopine, Felostad, Feloten, Felotens, Felpin, Flodicar, Flodil, Keliping, Keydipin, Lodistad, Modip, Munobal, Nirmadil, Parmid, Penedil, Perfudal, Phelop, Phenodical, Plendil, Plentopine, Polo, Presid, Preslow, Prevex, Renedil, Sistar, Splendil, Stapin, Topidil, Vascalpha, Versant, and XiaoDing. The combination of felodipine and candesartan was marketed as Atacand. The combination of felodipine and ramipril was marketed as Delmuno, Tazko, Triacor, Triapin, Triasyn, Tri-Plen, Unimax, and Unitens. The combination of felodipine and enalapril was marketed as Lexxel. The combination of felodipine and metoprolol was marketed as Logimat, Logimax, and Mobloc. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
94	Acarbose	WIKIPEDIA	"Acarbose (INN) is an anti-diabetic drug used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2 and, in some countries, prediabetes. It is a generic sold in Europe and China as Glucobay (Bayer AG), in North America as Precose (Bayer Pharmaceuticals), and in Canada as Prandase (Bayer AG). Acarbose is a starch blocker. It works by inhibiting alpha glucosidase, an intestinal enzyme that releases glucose from larger carbohydrates such as starch and sucrose. It is composed of an acarviosin moiety with a maltose at the reducing terminus. It can be degraded by a number of gut bacteria. Acarbose is cheap and popular in China, but not in the U.S. One physician explains that use in the U.S. is limited because it is not potent enough to justify the side effects of diarrhea and flatulence. However, a large study concluded in 2013 that ""acarbose is effective, safe and well tolerated in a large cohort of Asian patients with type 2 diabetes."" A possible explanation for the differing opinions is an observation that acarbose is significantly more effective in patients eating a relatively high-starch Eastern diet. == Medical uses == === Efficacy === In type II diabetic patients, acarbose averages an absolute decrease of 0.8 percentage points in HbA1c, which is a decrease of about 10% in typical HbA1c values in diabetes studies. Individuals with higher baseline levels show higher reductions, about an 0.12% additional decrease for each point of baseline HbA1c. Its effect on postprandial glucose, but not on HbA1c, scales with dose. Among diabetic patients, acarbose may help reduce the damage done to blood vessels and kidneys by reducing glucose levels. A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in people with prediabetes, defined as impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). It was found that acarbose reduced the incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2 when compared to placebo, however there was no conclusive evidence that acarbose, when compared to diet and exercise, metformin, placebo, or no intervention, improved all-cause mortality, reduced or increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, serious or non-serious adverse events, non-fatal stroke, congestive heart failure, or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Several studies showed that glucosidase inhibitors and alpha-amylase inhibitors promote loss of visceral fat and waist by acting as calorie restriction mimetics (linked to its acarbose-like action). === Combination therapy === The combination of acarbose with metformin results in greater reductions of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and post-prandial glucose than either agent alone. == Adverse effects == Since acarbose prevents the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, some carbohydrate will remain in the intestine and be delivered to the colon. In the colon, bacteria digest (ferment) the complex carbohydrates, causing gastrointestinal side-effects such as flatulence (78% of patients) and diarrhea (14% of patients). Since these effects are dose-related, in general it is advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount. One study found that gastrointestinal side effects decreased significantly (from 50% to 15%) over 24 weeks, even on constant dosing. Sucrose is more likely to trigger GI side effects compared to starch. Acarbose is associated with very rare elevated transaminases (19 out of 500,000). Even rarer cases of hepatitis has been reported with acarbose use. It usually goes away when the medicine is stopped. Liver enzymes should be checked before and during use of this medicine as a precaution. A 2016 meta-analysis confirms that alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, including acarbose, have a statistically significant link to elevated transaminase levels. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Acarbose inhibits enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) needed to digest carbohydrates, specifically, alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines, and pancreatic alpha-amylase. It locks up the enzymes by mimicking the transition state of the substrate with its amine linkage. However, bacterial alpha-amylases from gut microbiome are able to degrade acarbose. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, whereas the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels; the long-term effect is a reduction in HbA1c level. === Metabolism === Acarbose degradation is the unique feature of glycoside hydrolases in gut microbiota, acarbose degrading glucosidase, which hydrolyze acarbose into an acarviosine-glucose and glucose. Human enzymes do transform acarbose: the pancreatic alpha-amylase is able to perform a rearrangement reaction, moving the glucose unit in the ""tail"" maltose to the ""head"" of the molecule. Analog drugs with the ""tail"" glucose removed or flipped to an α(1-6) linkage resist this transformation. It has been reported that the maltogenic alpha-amylase from Thermus sp. IM6501 (ThMA) and a cyclodextrinase (CDase) from Streptococcus pyogenes could hydrolyse acarbose to glucose and acarviosine-glucose, ThMA can further hydrolyze acarviosine-glucose into acarviosin and glucose. A cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase) from gut bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum degraded acarbose via two different modes of action to produce maltose and acarviosin, as well as glucose and acarviosine-glucose, suggest that acarbose resistance is caused by the human microbiome. The microbiome-derived acarbose kinases are also specific to phosphorylate and inactivate acarbose. The molecular modeling showed the interaction between gut bacterial acarbose degrading glucosidase and human α-amylase. == Natural distribution == In nature, acarbose is synthesized by soil bacteria Actinoplanes sp through its precursor valienamine. And acarbose is also degraded by gut bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum and soil bacteria Thermus sp by acarbose degrading glucosidases. == In molecular biology == Acarbose is described chemically as a pseudotetrasaccharide, specifically a maltotetraose mimic inhibitor. As an inhibitor that mimics some natural substrates, it is useful for elucidating the structure of sugar-digesting enzymes, by binding into the same pocket. == Research == Most studies investigating alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity use acarbose as reference. In human T2DM patients, acarbose reduces total triglyceride levels. Acarbose has a similar effect in non-T2DM patients with isolated familial hypertriglyceridemia. In smaller samples of healthy human volunteers, acarbose increases postprandial GLP-1 levels. In studies conducted by three independent laboratories by the US National Institute on Aging's intervention testing programme, acarbose was shown to extend the lifespan of female mice by 5% and of male mice by 22%. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
97	3.alpha.,7.alpha.,12.alpha.-trihydroxycholestanoic acid	PUBMED	 3 alpha-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (SDH) quantifies ursodeoxycholic acid, 3 alpha,12 alpha-diol-7-one-5 beta-cholanoic acid, 3 alpha-ol-7-one-5 beta-cholanoic acid, and 3 alpha,7 alpha-diol-12-one-5 beta-cholanoic acid in a manner similar to the more commonly measured bile acids, exemplified by taurocholic acid. The type of oxygen function at the 7 or 12 position and its orientation at the 7 position has no effect on the rate of reaction of the enzyme. Discrepancies in the glycine/taurine ratios of patient intestinal aspirates containing ursodeoxycholic acid and oxo bile acids, obtained by SDH and gas-liquid chromatographic methods are not a result of the enzyme assay procedure. The proposed cholic precursor, 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-[3H]cholestan-26-oic acid, and [14C]cholesterol were infused intravenously at a constant rate into two dogs for 25 days. If the specific activities of trihydroxy[3H]cholestanoic acid and [3H]cholic acid will be equal after an isotopic steady-state is achieved. The specific activities of [14C]deoxycholic acid (formed from [14C]cholic acid) isolated in the stool of these two dogs were equal the last four days of the infusion indicating that labeled deoxycholic acid (and presumably labeled cholic acid) was in an isotopic steady-state. However, the specific activities of trihydroxy[3H]cholestanoic acid were 3.3 and 5.7 times greater than the specific activities of [3H]cholic acid, respectively. These data suggest that either an alternate route of cholic acid synthesis exists exclusive of trihydroxycholestanoic acid or that an isotopic steady state of trihydroxycholestanoic acid cannot be reached during an infusion of labeled trihydroxycholestanoic acid. The metabolism of 3 alpha, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholestanoic acid was studied in the bile fistula rats and in preparations from rat liver homogenates. In the bile fistula rats, the main products were chenodeoxycholic acid, alpha-muricholic acid, and beta-muricholic acid. Only small amounts of cholic acid were formed. Incubations of 3 alpha, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholestanoic acid with microsomes and NADPH yielded as the main product 3 alpha, 6 beta, 7 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestanoic acid. The formation of small amounts of 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestanoic acid was shown. The major product in incubations of 3 alpha, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholestanoic acid with microsomes and the 100,000 g supernatant fluid fortified with ATP was identified as 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 24 xi-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestanoic acid. This compound was converted into chenodeoxycholic acid and its metabolites in the bile fistula rat.	ENDOGENOUS	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': -2.1008714e-06, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
98	Tyrosine	WIKIPEDIA	"L-Tyrosine or tyrosine (symbol Tyr or Y) or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine is one of the 20 standard amino acids that are used by cells to synthesize proteins. It is a conditionally essential amino acid with a polar side group. The word ""tyrosine"" is from the Greek tyrós, meaning cheese, as it was first discovered in 1846 by German chemist Justus von Liebig in the protein casein from cheese. It is called tyrosyl when referred to as a functional group or side chain. While tyrosine is generally classified as a hydrophobic amino acid, it is more hydrophilic than phenylalanine. It is encoded by the codons UAC and UAU in messenger RNA. The one-letter symbol Y was assigned to tyrosine for being alphabetically nearest of those letters available. Note that T was assigned to the structurally simpler threonine, U was avoided for its similarity with V for valine, W was assigned to tryptophan, while X was reserved for undetermined or atypical amino acids. The mnemonic tYrosine was also proposed. == Functions == Aside from being a proteinogenic amino acid, tyrosine has a special role by virtue of the phenol functionality. Its hydroxy group is able to form the ester linkage, with phosphate in particular. Phosphate groups are transferred to tyrosine residues by way of protein kinases. This is one of the post-translational modifications. Phosphorylated tyrosine occurs in proteins that are part of signal transduction processes. Similar functionality is also presented in serine and threonine, whose side chains have a hydroxy group, but are alcohols. Phosphorylation of these three amino acids' moieties (including tyrosine) creates a negative charge on their ends, that is greater than the negative charge of the only negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acids. Phosphorylated proteins keep these same properties—which are useful for more reliable protein-protein interactions—by means of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Binding sites for a signalling phosphoprotein may be diverse in their chemical structure. Phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group can change the activity of the target protein, or may form part of a signaling cascade via SH2 domain binding. A tyrosine residue also plays an important role in photosynthesis. In chloroplasts (photosystem II), it acts as an electron donor in the reduction of oxidized chlorophyll. In this process, it loses the hydrogen atom of its phenolic OH-group. This radical is subsequently reduced in the photosystem II by the four core manganese clusters. == Dietary requirements and sources == The Dietary Reference Intake for tyrosine is usually estimated together with phenylalanine. It varies depending on an estimate method, however the ideal proportion of these two amino acids is considered to be 60:40 (phenylalanine:tyrosine) as a human body has such composition. Tyrosine, which can also be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine, is found in many high-protein food products such as meat, fish, cheese, cottage cheese, milk, yogurt, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soy protein and lima beans. For example, the white of an egg has about 250 mg per egg, while beef, lamb, pork, tuna, salmon, chicken, and turkey contain about 500–1000 mg per 3 ounces (85 g) portion. == Biosynthesis == In plants and most microorganisms, tyrosine is produced via prephenate, an intermediate on the shikimate pathway. Prephenate is oxidatively decarboxylated with retention of the hydroxyl group to give p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is transaminated using glutamate as the nitrogen source to give tyrosine and α-ketoglutarate. Mammals synthesize tyrosine from the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), which is derived from food. The conversion of Phe to Tyr is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of phenylalanine, such that it becomes tyrosine. == Metabolism == === Phosphorylation and sulfation === Some of the tyrosine residues can be tagged (at the hydroxyl group) with a phosphate group (phosphorylated) by protein kinases. In its phosphorylated form, tyrosine is called phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the key steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity. Phosphotyrosine can be detected through specific antibodies. Tyrosine residues may also be modified by the addition of a sulfate group, a process known as tyrosine sulfation. Tyrosine sulfation is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST). Like the phosphotyrosine antibodies mentioned above, antibodies have recently been described that specifically detect sulfotyrosine. === Precursor to neurotransmitters and hormones === In dopaminergic cells in the brain, tyrosine is converted to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine can then be converted into other catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in the colloid of the thyroid are also derived from tyrosine. === Precursor to other compounds === The latex of Papaver somniferum, the opium poppy, has been shown to convert tyrosine into the alkaloid morphine and the bio-synthetic pathway has been established from tyrosine to morphine by using Carbon-14 radio-labelled tyrosine to trace the in-vivo synthetic route.Tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) is an enzyme in the natural phenols biosynthesis pathway. It transforms L-tyrosine into p-coumaric acid. Tyrosine is also the precursor to the pigment melanin. Tyrosine (or its precursor phenylalanine) is needed to synthesize the benzoquinone structure which forms part of coenzyme Q10. === Degradation === The decomposition of L-tyrosine (syn. para-hydroxyphenylalanine) begins with an α-ketoglutarate dependent transamination through the tyrosine transaminase to para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The positional description para, abbreviated p, mean that the hydroxyl group and side chain on the phenyl ring are across from each other (see the illustration below). The next oxidation step catalyzes by p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and splitting off CO2 homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-1-acetate). In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase is required. Thereby, through the incorporation of a further O2 molecule, maleylacetoacetate is created. Fumarylacetoacetate is created by maleylacetoacetate cis-trans-isomerase through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation. This cis-trans-isomerase contains glutathione as a coenzyme. Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split by the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase through the addition of a water molecule. Thereby fumarate (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and acetoacetate (3-ketobutyroate) are liberated. Acetoacetate is a ketone body, which is activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter it can be converted into acetyl-CoA, which in turn can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle or be used for fatty acid synthesis. Phloretic acid is also a urinary metabolite of tyrosine in rats. == Ortho- and meta-tyrosine == Three structural isomers of L-tyrosine are known. In addition to the common amino acid L-tyrosine, which is the para isomer (para-tyr, p-tyr or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine), there are two additional regioisomers, namely meta-tyrosine (also known as 3-hydroxyphenylalanine, L-m-tyrosine, and m-tyr) and ortho-tyrosine (o-tyr or 2-hydroxyphenylalanine), that occur in nature. The m-tyr and o-tyr isomers, which are rare, arise through non-enzymatic free-radical hydroxylation of phenylalanine under conditions of oxidative stress. == Medical use == Tyrosine is a precursor to neurotransmitters and increases plasma neurotransmitter levels (particularly dopamine and norepinephrine), but has little if any effect on mood in normal subjects. A 2015 systematic review found that ""tyrosine loading acutely counteracts decrements in working memory and information processing that are induced by demanding situational conditions such as extreme weather or cognitive load"" and therefore ""tyrosine may benefit healthy individuals exposed to demanding situational conditions"". == Industrial synthesis == L-tyrosine is used in pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and food additives. Two methods were formerly used to manufacture L-tyrosine. The first involves the extraction of the desired amino acid from protein hydrolysates using a chemical approach. The second utilizes enzymatic synthesis from phenolics, pyruvate, and ammonia through the use of tyrosine phenol-lyase. Advances in genetic engineering and the advent of industrial fermentation have shifted the synthesis of L-tyrosine to the use of engineered strains of E. coli. == See also == Albinism Alkaptonuria Betalain Iodinated tyrosine derivatives Pauly reaction Tyramine Tyrosine sulfation Tyrosinemia == References == == External links == Tyrosine MS Spectrum Tyrosine metabolism Archived 2019-07-26 at the Wayback Machine Phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis Archived 2021-05-06 at the Wayback Machine"	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.0006332091, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -7.100059e-05, ' FOOD': -0.0051288037, ' MED': -0.0023938443, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07}
101	3.beta.-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid	PUBMED	 Metabolism of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid has been found to occur in rabbits and humans, species that cannot 7 alpha-hydroxylate lithocholic acid. This novel pathway for chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis from 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid led to a reinvestigation of the pathway for chenodeoxycholic acid from 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid in the hamster. Simultaneous infusion of equimolar [1,2-3H]lithocholic acid and 3 beta-hydroxy-5-[14C]cholenoic acid indicated that the 14C enrichment of chenodeoxycholic acid was much greater than that of lithocholic acid. Thus, in all these species, a novel 7 alpha-hydroxylation pathway exists that prevents the deleterious biologic effects of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid. Synthesis of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-[1,2-3H]cholenoic acid has permitted a study of its metabolism in bile-fistula hamsters that received the compound by intravenous infusion. Metabolites in bile were identified by reverse isotope dilution after their complete resolution by high pressure liquid chromatography using muPorasil. Recovery of administered radioactivity ranged from 21-60% in three animals. In each study, lithocholic acid (0.8-4.4%) and chenodeoxycholic acid (7.8-11.3%) were identified as metabolites of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoate and can be considered primary bile acids in the side-chain pathway of bile acid synthesis beginning with the oxidation of cholesterol to 26-hydroxycholesterol. Serum 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid (3 beta-OH-delta 5) was analyzed in 100 cases (90 patients with hepatobiliary diseases, 10 normal subjects) and its clinical significance investigated. The measurement of 3 beta-OH-delta 5 was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with immobilized 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) as the enzyme column. Esterified 3 beta-OH-delta 5 was measured after enzymatic hydrolysis with sulfatase and beta-glucuronidase. 3 beta-OH-delta 5 was hardly detected in normal cases. On the other hand, serum 3 beta-OH-delta 5 levels were remarkably high in cholestatic cases and also high in other cases with high bilirubin levels. The ratio of glycine- to taurine-conjugates (G/T ratio) was effective in discriminating cholestasis from hepatocellular damage such as in cases of acute hepatitis or fulminant hepatitis. More than 90% of the 3 beta-OH-delta 5, which is toxic, was sulfated or glucuronidated, suggesting detoxification by esterified bile acids. Significant increases of taurine-conjugated 3 beta-OH-delta 5 were observed in cases with pruritus, and a relationship between taurine-conjugated and pruritus was presumed. Therefore, analysis of 3 beta-OH-delta 5 is considered to be effective in clarifying the pathogenesis of hepatobiliary diseases.

103	Astaxanthin	WIKIPEDIA	"Astaxanthin is a keto-carotenoid within a group of chemical compounds known as carotenones or terpenes. Astaxanthin is a metabolite of zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin, containing both hydroxyl and ketone functional groups. It is a lipid-soluble pigment with red coloring properties, which result from the extended chain of conjugated (alternating double and single) double bonds at the center of the compound. The presence of the hydroxyl functional groups and the hydrophobic hydrocarbons render the molecule amphiphilic. Astaxanthin is produced naturally in the freshwater microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis, the yeast fungus Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (also known as Phaffia rhodozyma) and the bacteria Paracoccus carotinifaciens. When the algae are stressed by lack of nutrients, increased salinity, or excessive sunshine, they create astaxanthin. Animals who feed on the algae, such as salmon, red trout, red sea bream, flamingos, and crustaceans (shrimp, krill, crab, lobster, and crayfish), subsequently reflect the red-orange astaxanthin pigmentation. Astaxanthin is used as a dietary supplement for human, animal, and aquaculture consumption. Astaxanthin from algae, synthetic and bacterial sources is generally recognized as safe in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved astaxanthin as a food coloring (or color additive) for specific uses in animal and fish foods. The European Commission considers it as a food dye with E number E161j. The European Food Safety Authority has set an Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.2 mg per kg body weight, as of 2019. As a food color additive, astaxanthin and astaxanthin dimethyldisuccinate are restricted for use in Salmonid fish feed only. == Natural sources == Astaxanthin is present in most red-coloured aquatic organisms. The content varies from species to species, but also from individual to individual as it is highly dependent on diet and living conditions. Astaxanthin and other chemically related asta-carotenoids have also been found in a number of lichen species of the Arctic zone. The primary natural sources for industrial production of astaxanthin comprise the following: Euphausia pacifica (Pacific krill) Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) Haematococcus pluvialis (algae) Pandalus borealis (Arctic shrimp) Astaxanthin concentrations in nature are approximately: Algae are the primary natural source of astaxanthin in the aquatic food chain. The microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis contains high levels of astaxanthin (about 3.8% of dry weight), and is the primary industrial source of natural astaxanthin. In shellfish, astaxanthin is almost exclusively concentrated in the shells, with only low amounts in the flesh itself, and most of it only becomes visible during cooking as the pigment separates from the denatured proteins that otherwise bind it. Astaxanthin is extracted from Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) and from shrimp processing waste. == Biosynthesis == Astaxanthin biosynthesis starts with three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and one molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) that are combined by IPP isomerase and converted to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) by GGPP synthase. Two molecules of GGPP are then coupled by phytoene synthase to form phytoene. Next, phytoene desaturase creates four double bonds in the phytoene molecule to form lycopene. After desaturation, lycopene cyclase first forms γ-carotene by converting one of the ψ acyclic ends of the lycopene as a β-ring, then subsequently converts the other to form β-carotene. From β-carotene, hydrolases (blue) are responsible for the inclusion of two 3-hydroxy groups, and ketolases (green) for the addition of two 4-keto groups, forming multiple intermediate molecules until the final molecule, astaxanthin, is obtained. == Synthetic sources == The structure of astaxanthin by synthesis was described in 1975. Nearly all commercially available astaxanthin for aquaculture is produced synthetically, with an annual market of about $1 billion in 2019. An efficient synthesis from isophorone, cis-3-methyl-2-penten-4-yn-1-ol and a symmetrical C10-dialdehyde has been discovered and is used in industrial production. It combines these chemicals together with an ethynylation and then a Wittig reaction. Two equivalents of the proper ylide combined with the proper dialdehyde in a solvent of methanol, ethanol, or a mixture of the two, yields astaxanthin in up to 88% yields. == Metabolic engineering == The cost of astaxanthin extraction, high market price, and lack of efficient fermentation production systems, combined with the intricacies of chemical synthesis, discourage its commercial development. The metabolic engineering of bacteria (Escherichia coli) enables efficient astaxanthin production from beta-carotene via either zeaxanthin or canthaxanthin. == Structure == === Stereoisomers === In addition to structural isomeric configurations, astaxanthin also contains two chiral centers at the 3- and 3′-positions, resulting in three unique stereoisomers (3R,3′R and 3R,3'S meso and 3S,3'S). While all three stereoisomers are present in nature, relative distribution varies considerably from one organism to another. Synthetic astaxanthin contains a mixture of all three stereoisomers, in approximately 1:2:1 proportions. === Esterification === Astaxanthin exists in two predominant forms, non-esterified (yeast, synthetic) or esterified (algal) with various length fatty acid moieties whose composition is influenced by the source organism as well as growth conditions. The astaxanthin fed to salmon to enhance flesh coloration is in the non-esterified form The predominance of evidence supports a de-esterification of fatty acids from the astaxanthin molecule in the intestine prior to or concomitant with absorption resulting in the circulation and tissue deposition of non-esterified astaxanthin. European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a scientific opinion on a similar xanthophyll carotenoid, lutein, stating that ""following passage through the gastrointestinal tract and/or uptake lutein esters are hydrolyzed to form free lutein again"". While it can be assumed that non-esterified astaxanthin would be more bioavailable than esterified astaxanthin due to the extra enzymatic steps in the intestine needed to hydrolyse the fatty acid components, several studies suggest that bioavailability is more dependent on formulation than configuration. == Uses == Astaxanthin is used as a dietary supplement and feed supplement as food colorant for salmon, crabs, shrimp, chickens and egg production. === For seafood and animals === The primary use of synthetic astaxanthin today is as an animal feed additive to impart coloration, including farm-raised salmon and chicken egg yolks. Synthetic carotenoid pigments colored yellow, red or orange represent about 15–25% of the cost of production of commercial salmon feed. In the 21st century, most commercial astaxanthin for aquaculture is produced synthetically. Class action lawsuits were filed against some major grocery store chains for not clearly labeling the astaxanthin-treated salmon as ""color added"". The chains followed up quickly by labeling all such salmon as ""color added"". Litigation persisted with the suit for damages, but a Seattle judge dismissed the case, ruling that enforcement of the applicable food laws was up to government and not individuals. === Dietary supplement === The primary human application for astaxanthin is as a dietary supplement, and it remains under preliminary research. In 2020, the European Food Safety Authority reported that an intake of 8 mg astaxanthin per day from food supplements is safe for adults. == Role in the food chain == Lobsters, shrimp, and some crabs turn red when cooked because the astaxanthin, which was bound to the protein in the shell, becomes free as the protein denatures and unwinds. The freed pigment is thus available to absorb light and produce the red color. == Regulations == In April 2009, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved astaxanthin as an additive for fish feed only as a component of a stabilized color additive mixture. Color additive mixtures for fish feed made with astaxanthin may contain only those diluents that are suitable. The color additives astaxanthin, ultramarine blue, canthaxanthin, synthetic iron oxide, dried algae meal, Tagetes meal and extract, and corn endosperm oil are approved for specific uses in animal foods. Haematococcus algae meal (21 CFR 73.185) and Phaffia yeast (21 CFR 73.355) for use in fish feed to color salmonoids were added in 2000. In the European Union, astaxanthin-containing food supplements derived from sources that have no history of use as a source of food in Europe, fall under the remit of the Novel Food legislation, EC (No.) 258/97. Since 1997, there have been five novel food applications concerning products that contain astaxanthin extracted from these novel sources. In each case, these applications have been simplified or substantial equivalence applications, because astaxanthin is recognised as a food component in the EU diet. == References =="	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	{'FO': -0.00017743846, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -0.0002546641, ' PERSON': -0.0019595595, 'AL': -1.9385403e-05, ' CARE': 0.0}
106	Amantadine	WIKIPEDIA	"Amantadine, sold under the brand name Gocovri among others, is a medication used to treat dyskinesia associated with parkinsonism and influenza caused by type A influenzavirus, though its use for the latter is no longer recommended because of widespread drug resistance. It is also used for a variety of other uses. The drug is taken by mouth. Amantadine has a mild side effect profile. Common neurological side effects include drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, and confusion. Because of its effects on the central nervous system, it should be combined cautiously with additional central nervous system stimulants or anticholinergic drugs. Given that it is cleared by the kidneys, amantadine is contraindicated in persons with end stage kidney disease. Due to its anticholinergic effects, it should be taken with caution by those with enlarged prostates or glaucoma. The pharmacology of amantadine is complex. It acts as a sigma σ1 receptor agonist, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor negative allosteric modulator, dopaminergic agent, and weak NMDA receptor antagonist, among other actions. The precise mechanism of action of its therapeutic effects in the treatment of central nervous system disorders is unclear. The antiviral mechanism of action is inhibition of the influenza virus A M2 proton channel, which prevents endosomal escape (i.e., the release of viral genetic material into the host cytoplasm). Amantadine is an adamantane derivative and is related to memantine and rimantadine. Amantadine was first used for the treatment of influenza A. After its antiviral properties were initially reported in 1963, amantadine received approval for prophylaxis against the influenza virus A in 1966. In 1968, its antiparkinsonian effects were serendipitously discovered. In 1973, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved amantadine for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 2020, the extended-release formulation was approved for use in the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. == Medical uses == Amantadine was initially developed to prevent replication of the influenza A virus. Its main clinical use today is treatment of Parkinson's disease. Other uses include treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects, motor fluctuations during levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and autistic spectrum disorders. === Parkinson's disease === Amantadine is used to treat Parkinson's disease-related dyskinesia and drug-induced parkinsonism syndromes. Amantadine may be used alone or in combination with another anti-Parkinson's or anticholinergic drug. The specific symptoms targeted by amantadine therapy are dyskinesia and rigidity. The extended release amantadine formulation is commonly used to treat dyskinesias in people receiving levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease. A 2003 Cochrane review had concluded there was insufficient evidence to prove the safety or efficacy of amantadine to treat dyskinesia. In 2008, the World Health Organization reported amantadine is not effective as a stand-alone parkinsonian therapy, but recommended it could be used in combination therapy with levodopa. === Influenza A === Amantadine is not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza A in the United States. Amantadine has no effect preventing or treating influenza B infections. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 100% of seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples were resistant to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) during the 2008–2009 flu season. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend only neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza treatment and prophylaxis. The CDC recommends against amantadine and rimantadine to treat influenza A infections. Similarly, the 2011 World Health Organization (WHO) virology report showed all tested H1N1 influenza A viruses were resistant to amantadine. WHO guidelines recommend against use of M2 inhibitors for influenza A. The continued high rate of resistance observed in laboratory testing of influenza A has reduced the priority of M2 resistance testing. A 2014 Cochrane review did not find evidence for efficacy or safety of amantadine used for the prevention or treatment of influenza A. === Extrapyramidal symptoms === An extended-release formulation of amantadine is used to treat levodopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease. The WHO recommends the use of amantadine as a combination therapy to reduce levodopa side effects. === Off-label uses === ==== Fatigue in multiple sclerosis ==== A 2007 Cochrane literature review concluded that there was no overall evidence supporting the use of amantadine in treating fatigue in patients with MS. A follow-up 2012 Cochrane review stated that there may be some amantadine-induced improvement in fatigue in some people with MS. Despite multiple control trials that have also demonstrated improvements in subjective and objective ratings of fatigue, there is no final conclusion regarding its effectiveness. Consensus guidelines from the German Multiple Sclerosis Society (GMSS) in 2006 state that amantadine produces moderate improvement in subjective fatigue, problem solving, memory, and concentration. Thus, in 2006, GMSS guidelines recommended the use of amantadine in MS-related fatigue. In the UK NICE recommends considering amantadine for MS fatigue. ==== Disorders of consciousness ==== Disorders of consciousness (DoC) include coma, vegetative state (VS), and minimally conscious state (MCS). Amantadine has been shown to increase the rate of emergence from a MCS, defined by consistent demonstration of interactive communication and functional objective use. In traumatic brain injury patients in the intensive care unit, amantadine has also been shown in various randomized control trials to increase the rate of functional recovery and arousal, particularly in the time period immediately following an injury. There are also reports of significantly improved consciousness in patients treated for non-traumatic cases of DoC, such as in the case of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, and hypoxic encephalopathy. In 2018 the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) updated treatment guidelines on the use of amantadine for patients with prolonged DoC, recommending the use of amantadine (100–200 mg b.i.d.) for adults with DoC 4 to 16 weeks post injury to support early functional recovery and reduce disability. ==== Brain injury recovery ==== In various studies, amantadine and memantine have been shown to accelerate the rate of recovery from a brain injury. The time-limited window following a brain injury is characterized by neuroplasticity, or the capacity of neurons in the brain to adapt and compensate after injury. Thus, physiatrists will often start patients on amantadine as soon as impairments are recognized. There are also case reports showing improved functional recovery with amantadine treatment occurring years after the initial brain injury. There is insufficient evidence to determine if the functional gains are a result of effects through the dopamine or norepinephrine pathways. Some patients may benefit from direct dopamine stimulation with amantadine, while others may benefit more from other stimulants that act more on the norepinephrine pathway, such as methylphenidate. It is unclear if treatment with amantadine improves long-term outcomes or simply accelerates recovery. Nonetheless, amantadine-induced acceleration of recovery reduces the burden of disability, lessens health care costs, and minimizes psychosocial stressors in patients. == Contraindications == Amantadine is contraindicated in persons with end stage kidney disease. The drug is renally cleared. Amantadine may have anticholinergic side effects. Thus, patients with an enlarged prostate or glaucoma should use with caution. Live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated while taking amantadine. It is possible that amantadine will inhibit viral replication and reduce the efficacy of administered vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends avoiding amantadine for two weeks prior to vaccine administration and 48 hours afterward. == Side effects == Amantadine is generally well-tolerated and has a mild side effect profile. === Neurological === Side effects include drowsiness (especially while driving), lightheadedness, falls, and dizziness. Patients on amantadine should avoid combination with other central nervous system (CNS) depressing agents, such as alcohol. Excessive alcohol usage may increase the potential for CNS effects such as dizziness, confusion, and light headedness. Rare severe adverse effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, depression, convulsions, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. It has also been associated with disinhibited actions (gambling, sexual activity, spending, other addictions) and diminished control over compulsions. Amantadine may cause anxiety, feeling overexcited, hallucinations and nightmares. === Cardiovascular === Amantadine may cause orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and peripheral edema. === Gastrointestinal === Amantadine has also been associated with dry mouth and constipation. === Skin === Rare cases of skin rashes, such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome and livedo reticularis have also been reported in patients treated with amantadine. === Kidney === Amantadine inhibits the kidney's active-transport removal and transfer of creatinine from blood to urine, which normally occurs in the proximal tubules of the nephrons. The active-transport removal mechanism accounts for about fifteen percent of creatinine clearance. Therefore, amantadine may increase serum creatinine concentrations fifteen percent above normal levels and give the false impression of mild kidney disease in patients whose kidneys are actually undamaged (because kidney function is often assessed by measuring the concentration of creatinine in blood.) Also, if the patient does have kidney disease, amantadine may cause it to appear as much as fifteen percent worse than it actually is. === Pregnancy and lactation === Amantadine is Food and Drug Administration category C for pregnancy. Teratogenic effects have been observed in humans (case reports) and animal reproduction studies. Amantadine may also be present in breast milk and negatively alter breast milk production or excretion. The decision to breastfeed during amantadine therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the benefits of the drug to the mother. == Interactions == Amantadine may affect the central nervous system because of its dopaminergic and anticholinergic properties. The mechanisms of action are not fully known. Because of the CNS effects, caution is required when prescribing additional CNS stimulants or anticholinergic drugs. Thus, concurrent use of alcohol with Amantadine is not recommended because of enhanced CNS depressant effects. In addition, anti-dopaminergic drugs such as metoclopramide and typical antipsychotics should be avoided. These interactions are likely related to opposing dopaminergic mechanisms of action, which inhibits amantadine's anti-Parkinson effects. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === ==== Central nervous system disorders ==== The mechanism of action of the antiparkinsonian effects of amantadine is poorly understood. The effects of amantadine in Parkinson's disease were originally assumed to be anticholinergic or dopaminergic, but the situation soon proved more complicated than this. The pharmacodynamics of amantadine are complex and it interacts with many different biological targets at a variety of concentrations and hence potencies. The drug is a weak antagonist of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, increases dopamine release, and blocks dopamine reuptake. It is a negative allosteric modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically the α4β2 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In 1993, amantadine was found to bind to the sigma σ1 receptor with relatively high affinity (Ki = 20.25 μM). In 2004, it was discovered that amantadine and memantine bind to and act as agonists of the sigma σ1 receptor (Ki = 7.44 μM and 2.60 μM, respectively) and that activation of the σ1 receptor is potentially involved in the dopaminergic effects of amantadine at therapeutically relevant concentrations. σ1 receptor activation is one of amantadine's more potent actions. σ1 receptor agonists enhance tyrosine hydroxylase activity, modulate NMDA-stimulated dopamine release, increase dopamine release in the striatum in vivo, and decrease dopamine reuptake. As such, σ1 receptor activation may be involved in the antiparkinsonian and other central nervous system effects of amantadine. Binding of amantadine to the NMDA receptor was first reported in 1989 and antagonism of the receptor was first reported in 1991. Despite some reports, the NMDA receptor antagonism of amantadine is probably not its primary mechanism of action. It occurs at relatively high concentrations and many of the effects of amantadine are different from those of NMDA receptor antagonists. Some of its effects, such as enhancement of dopamine release in the striatum, are even reversed by NMDA receptor antagonists. However, NMDA receptor antagonism could still contribute to the effects of amantadine. Although some publications have reported that amantadine inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO), the drug probably does not actually inhibit this enzyme. Amantadine shows amphetamine-like psychostimulant effects (e.g., stimulation of locomotor activity) in animals at sufficiently high doses. It has been found to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine and to induce the release of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. However, the concentrations needed for these effects are very high and may not be therapeutically relevant. It is about 25 to 50 times less potent than amphetamines. Amantadine has been found to increase dopamine levels in the striatum. It does not act as a monoaminergic activity enhancer. Amantadine is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, for example of PDE1. Amantadine has been found to increase aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) expression. This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of dopamine from L-DOPA. An imaging study in humans found that amantadine increased AADC activity in the striatum by up to 27%. Various additional actions of amantadine have been described. ==== Influenza ==== The mechanisms for amantadine's antiviral and antiparkinsonian effects are unrelated. Amantadine targets the influenza A M2 ion channel protein. The M2 protein's function is to allow the intracellular virus to replicate (M2 also functions as a proton channel for hydrogen ions to cross into the vesicle), and exocytose newly formed viral proteins to the extracellular space (viral shedding). By blocking the M2 channel, the virus is unable to replicate because of impaired replication, protein synthesis, and exocytosis. Amantadine and rimantadine function in a mechanistically identical fashion, entering the barrel of the tetrameric M2 channel and blocking pore function—i.e., proton translocation. Resistance to the drug class is a consequence of mutations to the pore-lining amino acid residues of the channel, preventing both amantadine and rimantadine from binding and inhibiting the channel in their usual way. === Pharmacokinetics === Amantadine is well-absorbed orally. The onset of action is usually within 48 hours when used for parkinsonian syndromes, including dyskinesia. As plasma concentrations of amantadine increase, there is a greater risk for toxicity. Half-life elimination averages eight days in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Amantadine is only minimally removed by hemodialysis. Amantadine is metabolized to a small extent (5–15%) by acetylation. It is mainly excreted (90%) unchanged in urine by kidney excretion. == Chemistry == Amantadine is the organic compound 1-adamantylamine or 1-aminoadamantane, which consists of an adamantane backbone with an amino group substituted at one of the four tertiary carbons. Rimantadine is a closely related adamantane derivative with similar biological properties; both target the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus. Amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) is structurally related to other adamantanes including adapromine (1-(adamantan-1-yl)propan-1-amine), bromantane (N-(4-bromophenyl)adamantan-2-amine), memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane), and rimantadine (1-(1-aminoethyl)adamantane), among others. == History == === Influenza A === Antiviral properties were first reported in 1963 at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. In this amantadine trial study volunteer college students were exposed to a viral challenge. The group that received amantadine (100 milligrams 18 hours before viral challenge) had less Asia influenza infections than the placebo group. Amantadine received approval for the treatment of influenza virus A in adults in 1976. It was first used in West Germany in 1966. Amantadine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 1968, as a prophylactic agent against Asian (H2N2) influenza and received approval for prophylactic use for influenza A in 1976. During the 1980 influenza A epidemic, the first amantadine-resistance influenza viruses were reported. The frequency of amantadine resistance among influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1991 and 1995 was as low as 0.8%. In 2004 the resistance frequency increased to 12.3%. A year later resistance increase significantly to 96%, 72%, and 14.5% in China, South Korea, and the United States, respectively. By 2006, 90.6% of H3N2 strains and 15.6% of H1N1 were amantadine-resistant. A majority of the amantadine-resistant H3N2 isolates (98.2%) were found to contain an S31N mutation in the M2 transmembrane domain that confers resistance to amantadine. Currently, adamantane resistance is high among circulating influenza A viruses. Thus, they are no longer recommended for treatment of influenza A. === Parkinson's disease === An incidental finding in 1969 prompted investigations about amantadine's effectiveness for treating symptoms of Parkinson's disease. A woman with Parkinson's disease was prescribed amantadine to treat her influenza infection and reported her cogwheel rigidity and tremors improved. She also reported that her symptoms worsened after she finished the course of amantadine. The published case report was not initially corroborated by any other instances by the medical literature or manufacturer data. A team of researchers looked at a group of ten patients with Parkinson's disease and gave them amantadine. Seven of the ten patients showed improvement, which was convincing evidence for the need of a clinical trial, which included 163 patients with Parkinson's disease and 66% experienced subjective or objective reduction of symptoms with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Additional studies followed patients for greater lengths of time and in different combinations of neurological drugs. It was found to be a safe drug that could be used over long periods of time with few side effects as monotherapy or in combination with L-dopa or anti-cholinergic drugs. By April 1973, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved amantadine for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of amantadine in an extended release formulation for the treatment of dyskinesia, an adverse effect of levodopa in people with Parkinson's disease. == Society and culture == === Names === Brand names of amantadine include Gocovri, Symadine, and Symmetrel, among others. === Recreational use === Recreational use of amantadine at supratherapeutic doses has been reported. It is a weak NMDA receptor antagonist and is reported to produce dissociative and phencyclidine (PCP)-like effects in animals and humans at sufficiently high doses. However, the very long duration of action of amantadine (>40 hours) has likely limited its misuse potential. Recreational use of the related drug memantine has similarly been reported. === Veterinary misuse === In 2005, Chinese poultry farmers were reported to have used amantadine to protect birds against avian influenza. In Western countries and according to international livestock regulations, amantadine is approved only for use in humans. Chickens in China have received an estimated 2.6 billion doses of amantadine. Avian flu (H5N1) strains in China and southeast Asia are now resistant to amantadine, although strains circulating elsewhere still seem to be sensitive. If amantadine-resistant strains of the virus spread, the drugs of choice in an avian flu outbreak will probably be restricted to neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir which block the action of viral neuraminidase enzyme on the surface of influenza virus particles. However, there is an increasing incidence of oseltamivir resistance in circulating influenza strains (e.g., H1N1), highlighting the need for new anti-influenza therapies. In September 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the recall of Dingo Chip Twists ""Chicken in the Middle"" dog treats because the product has the potential to be contaminated with amantadine. == Research == === Depression === There has been interest in and study of amantadine in the treatment of depression. A 2017 systematic review of off-label augmentation for treatment of unipolar depression found two open-label studies of amantadine for augmenting imipramine and found that it was effective. However, the quality of evidence was very low and no conclusions could be drawn about its effectiveness. A 2022 systematic review of randomized controlled trials of glutamatergic agents for treatment-resistant depression identified one clinical trial of amantadine for this use. Amantadine was found to be effective in treating depressive symptoms in the trial. The mechanism of action of amantadine in the treatment of depression is unclear but various mechanisms have been postulated. These include dopaminergic actions like indirect enhancement of dopamine release, dopamine reuptake inhibition, and D2 receptor interactions, noradrenergic actions, glutamatergic actions like NMDA receptor antagonism, and immunomodulation, among many others. === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder === Amantadine has been studied in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A 2010 randomized clinical trial showed similar improvements in ADHD symptoms in children treated with amantadine as in those treated with methylphenidate, with less frequent side effects. A 2021 retrospective study showed that amantadine may serve as an effective adjunct to stimulants for ADHD-related symptoms and appears to be a safer alternative to second- or third-generation antipsychotics. === COVID-19 === Amantadine has been studied in the treatment of COVID-19. == References == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
109	Azithromycin	WIKIPEDIA	"Azithromycin, sold under the brand names Zithromax (in oral form) and Azasite (as an eye drop), is an antibiotic medication used for the treatment of several bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, strep throat, pneumonia, traveler's diarrhea, and certain other intestinal infections. Along with other medications, it may also be used for malaria. It is administered by mouth, into a vein, or into the eye. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and upset stomach. An allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, or a type of diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile is possible. Azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No harm has been found with its use during pregnancy. Its safety during breastfeeding is not confirmed, but it is likely safe. Azithromycin is an azalide, a type of macrolide antibiotic. It works by decreasing the production of protein, thereby stopping bacterial growth. Azithromycin was discovered in Yugoslavia (present day Croatia) in 1980 by the pharmaceutical company Pliva and approved for medical use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization lists it as an example under ""Macrolides and ketolides"" in its Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine (designed to help manage antimicrobial resistance). It is available as a generic medication and is sold under many brand names worldwide. In 2022, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Azithromycin is used to treat diverse infections, including: Acute bacterial sinusitis due to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae. A 1999 study found Azithromycin to be faster in resolving symptoms as compared to amoxicillin / clavulanic. Acute otitis media caused by H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae. A 2021 study concluded that Azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in its treatment and that it was safer and more tolerable in children. Community-acquired pneumonia due to C. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. pneumoniae, or S. pneumoniae. Genital ulcer disease (chancroid) in men due to H. ducreyi Pharyngitis or tonsillitis caused by S. pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy Prevention and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae. The benefits of long-term prophylaxis must be weighed on a patient-by-patient basis against the risk of cardiovascular and other adverse effects. Trachoma due to C. trachomatis Uncomplicated skin infections due to S. aureus, S. pyogenes, or S. agalactiae Scrub typhus caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. === Bacterial susceptibility === Azithromycin has relatively broad but shallow antibacterial activity. It inhibits some Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria, and many atypical bacteria. Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus (Methicillin-sensitive only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative microorganisms Bordetella pertussis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Legionella pneumophila Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Anaerobic microorganisms Peptostreptococcus species Prevotella bivia Other microorganisms Chlamydia trachomatis Chlamydophila pneumoniae Mycoplasma genitalium Mycoplasma pneumoniae Ureaplasma urealyticum === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === No harm has been found with use during pregnancy. However, there are no adequate well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The safety of the medication during breastfeeding is unclear. It was reported that because only low levels are found in breast milk and the medication has also been used in young children, it is unlikely that breastfed infants would have adverse effects. === Airway diseases === Azithromycin has beneficial effects in the treatment of asthma. It possesses antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties which contribute to its effectiveness. Asthma exacerbations can be caused by chronic neutrophilic inflammation, and azithromycin is known to reduce this type of inflammation due to its immunomodulatory properties. The recommended dosage for controlling asthma exacerbations with azithromycin is either 500 mg or 250 mg taken orally as tablets three times a week. In adults with severe asthma, low-dose azithromycin may be prescribed as an add-on treatment when standard therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids or long-acting beta2-agonists are not sufficient. Long-term use of azithromycin in patients with persistent symptomatic asthma aims to decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations and improve their quality of life. While both its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects play crucial roles in treating asthma, studies suggest that responsiveness to azithromycin therapy depends on individual variations in lung bacterial burden and microbial composition, collectively referred to as the lung microbiome. The richness (diversity) of the lung microbiome has been identified as a key factor in determining the effectiveness of azithromycin treatment. Azithromycin has significant interactions with the patient's microbiome. Long-term use of azithromycin reduces the presence of H. influenzae bacteria in the airways but also increases resistance against macrolide antibiotics. The specific pharmacological mechanisms through which azithromycin interacts with the patient's microbiome remain unknown as of 2024; research continues to explore how changes in microbial composition influence drug efficacy and patient outcomes. Azithromycin appears to be effective in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease through its suppression of inflammatory processes. Azithromycin is potentially useful in sinusitis via this mechanism. Azithromycin is believed to produce its effects through suppressing certain immune responses that may contribute to inflammation of the airways. == Adverse effects == Most common adverse effects are diarrhea (5%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting. Fewer than 1% of people stop taking the drug due to side effects. Nervousness, skin reactions, and anaphylaxis have been reported. Clostridioides difficile infection has been reported with use of azithromycin. Azithromycin does not affect the efficacy of birth control unlike some other antibiotics such as rifampin. Hearing loss has been reported. Occasionally, people have developed cholestatic hepatitis or delirium. Accidental intravenous overdose in an infant caused severe heart block, resulting in residual encephalopathy. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that azithromycin ""can cause abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart that may lead to a potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm."" The FDA noted in the warning a 2012 study that found the drug may increase the risk of death, especially in those with heart problems, compared with those on other antibiotics such as amoxicillin or no antibiotic. The warning indicated people with preexisting conditions are at particular risk, such as those with abnormalities in the QT interval, low blood levels of potassium or magnesium, a slower than normal heart rate, or those who use certain drugs to treat abnormal heart rhythms. The warning mentioned that azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. == Interactions == === Colchicine === Azithromycin, should not be taken with colchicine as it may lead to colchicine toxicity. Symptoms of colchicine toxicity include gastrointestinal upset, fever, myalgia, pancytopenia, and organ failure. === Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 === CYP3A4 is an enzyme that metabolizes many drugs in the liver. Some drugs can inhibit CYP3A4, which means they reduce its activity and increase the blood levels of the drugs that depend on it for elimination. This can lead to adverse effects or drug-drug interactions. Azithromycin is a member of macrolides that are a class of antibiotics with a cyclic structure with a lactone ring and sugar moieties. Macrolides can inhibit CYP3A4 by a mechanism called mechanism-based inhibition (MBI), which involves the formation of reactive metabolites that bind covalently and irreversibly to the enzyme, rendering it inactive. Mechanism-based inhibition is more serious and long-lasting than reversible inhibition, as it requires the synthesis of new enzyme molecules to restore the activity. The degree of mechanism-based inhibition by macrolides depends on the size and structure of their lactone ring. Clarithromycin and erythromycin have a 14-membered lactone ring, which is more prone to demethylation by CYP3A4 and subsequent formation of nitrosoalkenes, the reactive metabolites that cause mechanism-based inhibition. Azithromycin, on the other hand, has a 15-membered lactone ring, which is less susceptible to demethylation and nitrosoalkene formation. Therefore, azithromycin is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, while clarithromycin and erythromycin are strong inhibitors which increase the area under the curve (AUC) value of co-administered drugs more than five-fold. AUC it is a measure of the drug exposure in the body over time. By inhibiting CYP3A4, macrolide antibitiotics, such as erythromycin and clarithromycin, but not azithromycin, can significantly increase the AUC of the drugs that depend on it for clearance, which can lead to higher risk of adverse effects or drug-drug interactions. Azithromycin stands apart from other macrolide antibiotics because it is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and does not significantly increase AUC value of co-administered drugs. The difference in CYP3A4 inhibition by macrolides has clinical implications, for example for people who take statins, which are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of clarithromycin or erythromycin with statins can increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy, a condition that causes muscle pain and damage. Azithromycin, however, does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of statins and is considered a safer alternative than other macrolide antibiotics. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Azithromycin prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting translation of mRNA. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. === Pharmacokinetics === Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, so it can be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single dose of 500 mg, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of azithromycin is 68 hours. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, about 6% of the administered dose appears as an unchanged drug in urine. == History == A team of researchers at the pharmaceutical company Pliva in Zagreb, former Yugoslavia (present day Croatia) discovered azithromycin in 1980. The company Pliva patented it in 1981. In 1986, Pliva and Pfizer signed a licensing agreement, which gave Pfizer exclusive rights for the sale of azithromycin in Western Europe and the United States. Pliva put its azithromycin on the market in Central and Eastern Europe. Pfizer launched azithromycin under Pliva's license in other markets under the brand name Zithromax in 1991. Patent protection ended in 2005. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Azithromycin is available as a generic medication. Azithromycin is administered in film-coated tablet, capsule, oral suspension, intravenous injection, granules for suspension in sachet, and ophthalmic solution. === Usage === In 2010, azithromycin was the most prescribed antibiotic for outpatients in the US, whereas in Sweden, where outpatient antibiotic use is a third as prevalent, macrolides are only on 3% of prescriptions. In 2017, and 2022, azithromycin was the second most prescribed antibiotic for outpatients in the United States. In 2022, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. === Brand names === == Research == Azithromycin is researched for its supposed anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, which are believed to be exhibited through its suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which is important in dampening inflammation. Cytokines are small proteins that are secreted by immune cells and play a key role in the immune response. Studies suggest that azithromycin can decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 while increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. By decreasing the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, azithromycin probably controls potential tissue damage during inflammation. These effects are believed to be due to azithromycin's ability to suppress a transcription factor called nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) resulting in blockade of inflammatory response pathways downstream from NF-κB activation leading to decreased chemokine receptor CXCR4 signaling causing reduced inflammation. Despite the efficiency of treating rosacea with azithromycin, the exact mechanism of why azithromycin is effective in treating rosacea are not completely understood. It is unclear whether its antibacterial or immunomodulatory properties or a combination of both mechanisms contribute to its efficacy. Azithromycin may prevent mast cell degranulation and thus can suppress inflammation of dorsal root ganglia through various signaling pathways such as decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells which are particularly relevant since they mediate the response of hair follicle antigens. Inflammation in rosacea is thought to be associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inflammatory cells. The ability of azithromycin to decrease ROS production can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, but this remains speculation. The therapeutic role of azithromycin has been explored in various diseases such as cystic fibrosis exacerbation, burn injury-induced lung injury, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in COVID-19 infection. Despite early evidence showing azithromycin slowed down coronavirus multiplication in laboratory settings, further research indicates it to be ineffective as a treatment for COVID-19 in humans. Azithromycin in conjunction with of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been associated with deleterious outcomes in COVID-19 patients, including drug-induced QT prolongation. After a large-scale trial showed no benefit of using azithromycin in treating COVID-19, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its guidance and no longer recommends the medication for COVID-19. Azithromycin has been studied in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and has been reported to improve or even resolve symptoms in some cases. However, these studies have been described as being of very low quality. In any case, the beneficial effects might be by eradication of chronic bacterial infections that are possibly contributing to or causing CFS or by the immunomodulatory effects of azithromycin. Azithromycin therapy in cystic fibrosis patients yields a modest respiratory function improvement, reduces exacerbation risk, and extends time to exacerbation up to six months; still, long-term efficacy data is a subject of ongoing research. Potential benefits of azithromycin therapy is azithromycin's good safety profile, minimal treatment burden, and cost-effectiveness, but the drawbacks are gastrointestinal side effects with weekly dosing, which are ameliorated by a split dose regimen. The potential role of azithromycin in inhibiting the autophagic destruction of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) within macrophages has garnered significant attention. This mechanism may contribute to the observed correlation between long-term macrolide monotherapy and an increased risk of NTM infection and the emergence of macrolide-resistant strains. Azithromycin's interference with autophagy could potentially predispose patients with cystic fibrosis to mycobacterial infections. Despite repeated refutations of a direct association between azithromycin use and NTM infection, there remains a high level of concern regarding the potential for the development of NTM strains resistant to macrolides. Azithromycin has been shown to be an effective preventive measure against many postpartum infections in mothers following planned vaginal births; still, its impact on neonatal outcomes remains inconclusive and is the subject of ongoing research. == References == == See also == Zrinka Tamburašev, Croatian biochemist on the team that discovered azithromycin"	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
113	Cyclo(tyr-pro)	PUBMED	 An ultimate and general model describing the interaction between opioid ligands and mu-opioid receptors is not available yet, so the mode of action of atypical peptide analogues or peptidomimetics is worthy of investigation. In this context, the peptide c[-Tyr-d-Pro-d-Trp-Phe-Gly-] was observed to act as an agonist toward mu-opioid receptors with appreciable potency, albeit deprived of a protonable nitrogen. This compound was synthesized as a member of a library of diastereo- or enantiomeric cyclic peptides based on the sequence of endomorphin-1, aiming to obtain lipophilic peptide ligands active at the mu-opioid receptors, having good performances in terms of resistance to enzymatic degradation and permeation of biological barriers.

126	Glycocholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Glycocholic acid, or cholylglycine, is a crystalline bile acid involved in the emulsification of fats. It occurs as a sodium salt in the bile of mammals. It is a conjugate of cholic acid with glycine. Its anion is called glycocholate. == See also == Taurocholic acid == References ==	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': 0.0, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
129	Phenylalanine	WIKIPEDIA	"Phenylalanine (symbol Phe or F) is an essential α-amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2. It can be viewed as a benzyl group substituted for the methyl group of alanine, or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This essential amino acid is classified as neutral, and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. The L-isomer is used to biochemically form proteins coded for by DNA. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the biological pigment melanin. It is encoded by the messenger RNA codons UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is found naturally in the milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement as it is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenethylamine. As an essential amino acid, phenylalanine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine-containing proteins. The one-letter symbol F was assigned to phenylalanine for its phonetic similarity. == History == The first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the empirical formula, C9H11NO2, in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) seedlings. In 1882, Erlenmeyer and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia. The genetic codon for phenylalanine was first discovered by J. Heinrich Matthaei and Marshall W. Nirenberg in 1961. They showed that by using mRNA to insert multiple uracil repeats into the genome of the bacterium E. coli, they could cause the bacterium to produce a polypeptide consisting solely of repeated phenylalanine amino acids. This discovery helped to establish the nature of the coding relationship that links information stored in genomic nucleic acid with protein expression in the living cell. == Dietary sources == Good sources of phenylalanine are eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, and soybeans. Another common source of phenylalanine is anything sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame, such as diet drinks, diet foods and medication; the metabolism of aspartame produces phenylalanine as one of the compound's metabolites. == Dietary recommendations == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For phenylalanine plus tyrosine, for adults 19 years and older, 33 mg/kg body weight/day. In 2005 the DRI is set to 27 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine), the FAO/WHO/UNU recommendation of 2007 is 25 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine). == Other biological roles == L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids. L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier. In excessive quantities, supplementation can interfere with the production of serotonin and other aromatic amino acids as well as nitric oxide due to the overuse (eventually, limited availability) of the associated cofactors, iron or tetrahydrobiopterin. The corresponding enzymes for those compounds are the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family and nitric oxide synthase. === In plants === Phenylalanine is the starting compound used in the synthesis of flavonoids. Lignan is derived from phenylalanine and from tyrosine. Phenylalanine is converted to cinnamic acid by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. == Biosynthesis == Phenylalanine is biosynthesized via the shikimate pathway. == Phenylketonuria == The genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) is the inability to metabolize phenylalanine because of a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Individuals with this disorder are known as ""phenylketonurics"" and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood. Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and μmol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 μmol/L. A (rare) ""variant form"" of phenylketonuria called hyperphenylalaninemia is caused by the inability to synthesize a cofactor called tetrahydrobiopterin, which can be supplemented. Pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninemia may show similar symptoms of the disorder (high levels of phenylalanine in blood), but these indicators will usually disappear at the end of gestation. Pregnant women with PKU must control their blood phenylalanine levels even if the fetus is heterozygous for the defective gene because the fetus could be adversely affected due to hepatic immaturity. A non-food source of phenylalanine is the artificial sweetener aspartame. This compound is metabolized by the body into several chemical byproducts including phenylalanine. The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: ""Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine."" In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer to the presence of ""aspartame or E951"" and they must be labeled with a warning ""Contains a source of phenylalanine."" In Brazil, the label ""Contém Fenilalanina"" (Portuguese for ""Contains Phenylalanine"") is also mandatory in products which contain it. These warnings are placed to help individuals avoid such foods. == D-, L- and DL-phenylalanine == The stereoisomer D-phenylalanine (DPA) can be produced by conventional organic synthesis, either as a single enantiomer or as a component of the racemic mixture. It does not participate in protein biosynthesis although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been processed. The biological functions of D-amino acids remain unclear, although D-phenylalanine has pharmacological activity at niacin receptor 2. DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is marketed as a nutritional supplement for its purported analgesic and antidepressant activities, which have been supported by clinical trials. DL-Phenylalanine is a mixture of D-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of DL-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by D-phenylalanine of enkephalin degradation by the enzyme carboxypeptidase A. Enkephalins act as agonists of the mu and delta opioid receptors, and agonists of these receptors are known to produce antidepressant effects. The mechanism of DL-phenylalanine's supposed antidepressant activity may also be accounted for in part by the precursor role of L-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, though clinical trials have not found an antidepressant effect from L-phenylalanine alone. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect. D-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the portal circulation. A small amount of D-phenylalanine appears to be converted to L-phenylalanine. D-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the systemic circulation. It appears to cross the blood–brain barrier less efficiently than L-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of D-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine without penetrating the central nervous system. L-Phenylalanine is an antagonist at α2δ Ca2+ calcium channels with a Ki of 980 nM. In the brain, L-phenylalanine is a competitive antagonist at the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor and at the glutamate binding site of AMPA receptor. At the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor L-phenylalanine has an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of 573 μM estimated by Schild regression which is considerably lower than brain L-phenylalanine concentration observed in untreated human phenylketonuria. L-Phenylalanine also inhibits neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex with IC50 of 980 μM, a brain concentration seen in classical phenylketonuria, whereas D-phenylalanine has a significantly smaller effect. == Commercial synthesis == L-Phenylalanine is produced for medical, feed, and nutritional applications, such as aspartame, in large quantities by utilizing the bacterium Escherichia coli, which naturally produces aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine. The quantity of L-phenylalanine produced commercially has been increased by genetically engineering E. coli, such as by altering the regulatory promoters or amplifying the number of genes controlling enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the amino acid. == Derivatives == Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, used in neutron capture therapy. 4-Azido-L-phenylalanine is a protein-incorporated unnatural amino acid used as a tool for bioconjugation in the field of chemical biology. == References == == External links == Phenylalanine mass spectrum Phenylalanine at ChemSynthesis"	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.008796559, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': -1.9361265e-07, ',': -0.1036503, ' FOOD': -0.00039075434, ' MED': -0.00043150366, 'ICAL': -2.0219828e-05}
135	Methylthioadenosine	WIKIPEDIA	5′-Methylthioadenosine is S-methyl derivative of the adenosine. It is an intermediate in the methylthioadenosine (MTA) cycle, also known as the methionine salvage pathway that is universal to aerobic life. == Formation == The pervasive cofactor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is the precursor to 5′-methylthioadenosine. The sulfonium group in SAM can cleave in three ways, one involves loss of CH2CH2CH(NH3+)CO2−, generating the title compound. == History == In 1912, an adenine nucleoside was isolated by Hunter et al. from yeast that were grown without phosphorus or sulfur. Later in 1925, that substance was shown by Levene and Sobotkal to be adenylthiomethylpentose. In 1936, Nakahara et al. did experiments on rats that suggested that vitamin L2 deficiency inhibits the ability of female rats for lactation. In 1942, they identified vitamin L2 to be adenylthiomethylpentose. Later studies by Folley et al (1942) refuted Nakahara's claims and demonstrated that L2 is not necessary for lactation and thus L2 is not considered a vitamin today. Hecht found in 1937 that the body temperature of rabbits, cats and guinea pigs were lowered by 1 to 2 degrees after he gave them adenylthiomethylpentose at a dose of 0.2 g/kg. Kühn et al. replicated this in guinea pigs in 1941. == References == == Further reading ==	ENDOGENOUS	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': -2.577686e-06, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
138	Methionine	WIKIPEDIA	"Methionine (symbol Met or M) () is an essential amino acid in humans. As the precursor of other non-essential amino acids such as cysteine and taurine, versatile compounds such as SAM-e, and the important antioxidant glutathione, methionine plays a critical role in the metabolism and health of many species, including humans. Methionine is also involved in angiogenesis and various processes related to DNA transcription, epigenetic expression, and gene regulation. Methionine was first isolated in 1921 by John Howard Mueller. It is encoded by the codon AUG. It was named by Satoru Odake in 1925, as an abbreviation of its structural description 2-amino-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid. == Biochemical details == Methionine (abbreviated as Met or M; encoded by the codon AUG) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological pH conditions), an amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form under biological pH conditions) located in α-position with respect to the carboxyl group, and an S-methyl thioether side chain, classifying it as a nonpolar, aliphatic amino acid. In nuclear genes of eukaryotes and in Archaea, methionine is coded for by the start codon, meaning it indicates the start of the coding region and is the first amino acid produced in a nascent polypeptide during mRNA translation. == A proteinogenic amino acid == Cysteine and methionine are the two sulfur-containing proteinogenic amino acids. Excluding the few exceptions where methionine may act as a redox sensor (e.g.,methionine sulfoxide), methionine residues do not have a catalytic role. This is in contrast to cysteine residues, where the thiol group has a catalytic role in many proteins. The thioether within methionine does however have a minor structural role due to the stability effect of S/π interactions between the side chain sulfur atom and aromatic amino acids in one-third of all known protein structures. This lack of a strong role is reflected in experiments where little effect is seen in proteins where methionine is replaced by norleucine, a straight hydrocarbon sidechain amino acid which lacks the thioether. It has been conjectured that norleucine was present in early versions of the genetic code, but methionine intruded into the final version of the genetic code due to the fact it is used in the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e). This situation is not unique and may have occurred with ornithine and arginine. === Encoding === Methionine is one of only two amino acids encoded by a single codon (AUG) in the standard genetic code (tryptophan, encoded by UGG, is the other). In reflection to the evolutionary origin of its codon, the other AUN codons encode isoleucine, which is also a hydrophobic amino acid. In the mitochondrial genome of several organisms, including metazoa and yeast, the codon AUA also encodes for methionine. In the standard genetic code AUA codes for isoleucine and the respective tRNA (ileX in Escherichia coli) uses the unusual base lysidine (bacteria) or agmatidine (archaea) to discriminate against AUG. The methionine codon AUG is also the most common start codon. A ""Start"" codon is message for a ribosome that signals the initiation of protein translation from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a Kozak consensus sequence. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of proteins in eukaryotes and archaea during translation, although it can be removed by post-translational modification. In bacteria, the derivative N-formylmethionine is used as the initial amino acid. == Derivatives == === S-Adenosylmethionine === The methionine-derivative S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) is a cofactor that serves mainly as a methyl donor. SAM-e is composed of an adenosyl molecule (via 5′ carbon) attached to the sulfur of methionine, therefore making it a sulfonium cation (i.e., three substituents and positive charge). The sulfur acts as a soft Lewis acid (i.e., donor/electrophile) which allows the S-methyl group to be transferred to an oxygen, nitrogen, or aromatic system, often with the aid of other cofactors such as cobalamin (vitamin B12 in humans). Some enzymes use SAM-e to initiate a radical reaction; these are called radical SAM-e enzymes. As a result of the transfer of the methyl group, S-adenosylhomocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the homocysteine, leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into autoinducer-2, which is excreted as a waste product or quorum signal. == Biosynthesis == As an essential amino acid, methionine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, which must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins. In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis belongs to the aspartate family, along with threonine and lysine (via diaminopimelate, but not via α-aminoadipate). The main backbone is derived from aspartic acid, while the sulfur may come from cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. First, aspartic acid is converted via β-aspartyl semialdehyde into homoserine by two reduction steps of the terminal carboxyl group (homoserine has therefore a γ-hydroxyl, hence the homo- series). The intermediate aspartate semialdehyde is the branching point with the lysine biosynthetic pathway, where it is instead condensed with pyruvate. Homoserine is the branching point with the threonine pathway, where instead it is isomerised after activating the terminal hydroxyl with phosphate (also used for methionine biosynthesis in plants). Homoserine is then activated with a phosphate, succinyl or an acetyl group on the hydroxyl. In plants and possibly in some bacteria, phosphate is used. This step is shared with threonine biosynthesis. In most organisms, an acetyl group is used to activate the homoserine. This can be catalysed in bacteria by an enzyme encoded by metX or metA (not homologues). In enterobacteria and a limited number of other organisms, succinate is used. The enzyme that catalyses the reaction is MetA and the specificity for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is dictated by a single residue. The physiological basis for the preference of acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA is unknown, but such alternative routes are present in some other pathways (e.g. lysine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis). The hydroxyl activating group is then replaced with cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. A replacement reaction is technically a γ-elimination followed by a variant of a Michael addition. All the enzymes involved are homologues and members of the Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family, which is a subset of the PLP-dependent fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP (pyridoxal phosphate), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates. If it reacts with cysteine, it produces cystathionine, which is cleaved to yield homocysteine. The enzymes involved are cystathionine-γ-synthase (encoded by metB in bacteria) and cystathionine-β-lyase (metC). Cystathionine is bound differently in the two enzymes allowing β or γ reactions to occur. If it reacts with free hydrogen sulfide, it produces homocysteine. This is catalysed by O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase (formerly known as O-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase. It is encoded by either metY or metZ in bacteria. If it reacts with methanethiol, it produces methionine directly. Methanethiol is a byproduct of catabolic pathway of certain compounds, therefore this route is more uncommon. If homocysteine is produced, the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two methionine synthases are known; one is cobalamin (vitamin B12) dependent and one is independent. The pathway using cysteine is called the ""transsulfuration pathway"", while the pathway using hydrogen sulfide (or methanethiol) is called ""direct-sulfurylation pathway"". Cysteine is similarly produced, namely it can be made from an activated serine and either from homocysteine (""reverse transsulfurylation route"") or from hydrogen sulfide (""direct sulfurylation route""); the activated serine is generally O-acetylserine (via CysK or CysM in E. coli), but in Aeropyrum pernix and some other archaea O-phosphoserine is used. CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade. === Transsulfurylation pathway === Enzymes involved in the E. coli transsulfurylation route of methionine biosynthesis: Aspartokinase Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase Homoserine dehydrogenase Homoserine O-transsuccinylase Cystathionine-γ-synthase Cystathionine-β-lyase Methionine synthase (in mammals, this step is performed by homocysteine methyltransferase or betaine—homocysteine S-methyltransferase.) == Other biochemical pathways == Although mammals cannot synthesize methionine, they can still use it in a variety of biochemical pathways: === Catabolism === Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) by (1) methionine adenosyltransferase. SAM-e serves as a methyl donor in many (2) methyltransferase reactions, and is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). (3) Adenosylhomocysteinase cysteine. === Regeneration === Methionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via (4) methionine synthase in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor. Homocysteine can also be remethylated using glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine, TMG) to methionine via the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (E.C.2.1.1.5, BHMT). BHMT makes up to 1.5% of all the soluble protein of the liver, and recent evidence suggests that it may have a greater influence on methionine and homocysteine homeostasis than methionine synthase. === Reverse-transulfurylation pathway: conversion to cysteine === Homocysteine can be converted to cysteine. (5) Cystathionine-β-synthase (an enzyme which requires pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6) combines homocysteine and serine to produce cystathionine. Instead of degrading cystathionine via cystathionine-β-lyase, as in the biosynthetic pathway, cystathionine is broken down to cysteine and α-ketobutyrate via (6) cystathionine-γ-lyase. (7) The enzyme α-ketoacid dehydrogenase converts α-ketobutyrate to propionyl-CoA, which is metabolized to succinyl-CoA in a three-step process (see propionyl-CoA for pathway). === Ethylene synthesis === This amino acid is also used by plants for synthesis of ethylene. The process is known as the Yang cycle or the methionine cycle. == Metabolic diseases == The degradation of methionine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) Homocystinuria Methylmalonic acidemia Propionic acidemia == Chemical synthesis == The industrial synthesis combines acrolein, methanethiol, and cyanide, which affords the hydantoin. Racemic methionine can also be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate by alkylation with chloroethylmethylsulfide (ClCH2CH2SCH3) followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation. Also see Methanol. == Human nutrition == There is inconclusive clinical evidence on methionine supplementation. Dietary restriction of methionine can lead to bone-related disorders. Methionine supplementation may benefit those suffering from copper poisoning. Overconsumption of methionine, the methyl group donor in DNA methylation, is related to cancer growth in a number of studies. === Requirements === The Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For methionine combined with cysteine, for adults 19 years and older, 19 mg/kg body weight/day. This translates to about 1.33 grams per day for a 70 kilogram individual. === Dietary sources === High levels of methionine can be found in eggs, meat, and fish; sesame seeds, Brazil nuts, and some other plant seeds; and cereal grains. Most fruits and vegetables contain very little. Most legumes, though protein dense, are low in methionine. Proteins without adequate methionine are not considered to be complete proteins. For that reason, racemic methionine is sometimes added as an ingredient to pet foods. == Health == Loss of methionine has been linked to senile greying of hair. Its lack leads to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in hair follicles, a reduction in tyrosinase effectiveness, and a gradual loss of hair color. Methionine raises the intracellular concentration of glutathione, thereby promoting antioxidant-mediated cell defense and redox regulation. It also protects cells against dopamine induced nigral cell loss by binding oxidative metabolites. Methionine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cysteine, carnitine, taurine, lecithin, phosphatidylcholine, and other phospholipids. Improper conversion of methionine can lead to atherosclerosis due to accumulation of homocysteine. == Other uses == DL-Methionine is sometimes given as a supplement to dogs; It helps reduce the chances of kidney stones in dogs. Methionine is also known to increase the urinary excretion of quinidine by acidifying the urine. Aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and urinary acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used. Methionine is allowed as a supplement to organic poultry feed under the US certified organic program. Methionine can be used as a nontoxic pesticide option against giant swallowtail caterpillars, which are a serious pest to orange crops. == See also == Allantoin Formylmethionine Methionine oxidation Paracetamol poisoning Photoreactive methionine S-Methylcysteine == References == == External links == Rudra MN, Chowdhury LM (30 September 1950).

139	Sulforaphane	WIKIPEDIA	Sulforaphane (sometimes sulphoraphane in British English) is a compound within the isothiocyanate group of organosulfur compounds. It is produced when the enzyme myrosinase transforms glucoraphanin, a glucosinolate, into sulforaphane upon damage to the plant (such as from chewing or chopping during food preparation), which allows the two compounds to mix and react. Sulforaphane is present in cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. Sulforaphane has two possible stereoisomers due to the presence of a stereogenic sulfur atom. The R-sulforaphane enantiomer occurs naturally, while the S-sulforaphane can be synthesized. == Occurrence and isolation == Sulforaphane occurs in broccoli sprouts, which, among cruciferous vegetables, have the highest concentration of glucoraphanin, the precursor to sulforaphane. It is also found in cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, bok choy, kale, collards, mustard greens, and watercress. == Research == Although there has been some basic research on how sulforaphane might have effects in vivo, there is no clinical evidence that consuming cruciferous vegetables and sulforaphane affects the risk of cancer or any other disease, as of 2017. == See also == Raphanin == References ==	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -3.888926e-06, 'OD': 0.0}
140	Metoprolol	WIKIPEDIA	"Metoprolol, sold under the brand name Lopressor among others, is a medication used to treat angina and a number of conditions involving an abnormally fast heart rate. It is also used to prevent further heart problems after myocardial infarction and to prevent headaches in those with migraines. It is a selective β1 receptor blocker medication. It is taken by mouth or is given intravenously. Common side effects include trouble sleeping, feeling tired, feeling faint, and abdominal discomfort. Large doses may cause serious toxicity. Risk in pregnancy has not been ruled out. It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. The metabolism of metoprolol can vary widely among patients, often as a result of hepatic impairment or CYP2D6 polymorphism. Metoprolol was first made in 1969, patented in 1970, and approved for medical use in 1978. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the sixth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 65 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Metoprolol is used for a number of conditions, including angina, acute myocardial infarction, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and prevention of migraine headaches. It is an adjunct in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Both oral and intravenous forms of metoprolol are available for administration. The different salt versions of metoprolol – metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate – are approved for different conditions and are not interchangeable. Off-label uses include supraventricular tachycardia and thyroid storm. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects, especially with higher doses, include dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, diarrhea, unusual dreams, trouble sleeping, depression, and vision problems such as blurred vision or dry eyes. β-blockers, including metoprolol, reduce salivary flow via inhibition of the direct sympathetic innervation of the salivary glands. Metoprolol may also cause the hands and feet to feel cold. Due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier, lipophilic beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances such as insomnia, vivid dreams and nightmares. Patients should be cautious while driving or operating machinery due to its potential to cause decreased alertness. There may also be an impact on blood sugar levels, and it can potentially mask signs of low blood sugar. The safety of metoprolol during pregnancy is not fully established. === Precautions === Metoprolol reduces long-term mortality and hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure. A meta-analysis further supports reduced incidence of heart failure worsening in patients treated with beta-blockers compared to placebo. However, in some circumstances, particularly when initiating metoprolol in patients with more symptomatic disease, an increased prevalence of hospitalisation and mortality has been reported within the first two months of starting. Patients should monitor for swelling of extremities, fatigue, and shortness of breath. A Cochrane Review concluded that although metoprolol reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence, it is unclear whether the long-term benefits outweigh the risks. This medicine may cause changes in blood sugar levels or cover up signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid pulse rate. It also may cause some people to become less alert than they are normally, making it dangerous for them to drive or use machines. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Risk for the fetus has not been ruled out, per being rated pregnancy category C in Australia, meaning that it may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus (but no malformations). It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. == Overdose == Excessive doses of metoprolol can cause bradycardia, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, seizures, and cardiorespiratory arrest. Blood or plasma concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of overdose or poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 200 μg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 1–20 mg/L in overdose victims. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Metoprolol is a beta blocker, or an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is specifically a selective antagonist of the β1-adrenergic receptor and has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Metoprolol exerts its effects by blocking the action of certain neurotransmitters, specifically adrenaline and noradrenaline. It does this by selectively binding to and antagonizing β-1 adrenergic receptors in the body. When adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline (norepinephrine) are released from nerve endings or secreted by the adrenal glands, they bind to β-1 adrenergic receptors found primarily in cardiac tissues such as the heart. This binding activates these receptors, leading to various physiological responses, including an increase in heart rate, force of contraction (inotropic effect), conduction speed through electrical pathways in the heart, and release of renin from the kidneys. Metoprolol competes with adrenaline and noradrenaline for binding sites on these β-1 receptors. By occupying these receptor sites without activating them, metoprolol blocks or inhibits their activation by endogenous catecholamines like adrenaline or noradrenaline. Metoprolol blocks β1-adrenergic receptors in heart muscle cells, thereby decreasing the slope of phase 4 in the nodal action potential (reducing Na+ uptake) and prolonging repolarization of phase 3 (slowing down K+ release). It also suppresses the norepinephrine-induced increase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak and the spontaneous SR Ca2+ release, which are the major triggers for atrial fibrillation. Through this mechanism of selective blockade at beta-(β)-1 receptors, metoprolol exerts the following effects: Heart rate reduction, i.e., decrease of the resting heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and reduction of excessive elevations resulting from exercise or stress. Reduction of the force of contraction, i.e., decrease in contractility (negative inotropic effect), which lessens how hard each heartbeat contracts. Decrease in cardiac output, i.e., decrease in both heart rate and contractility within myocardium cells, where beta-(β)-1 is predominantly located, overall blood output per minute lowers called cardiac output/dysfunction, allowing decreased demands placed onto impaired hearts, reducing oxygen demand-supply mismatch. Lowering of blood pressure. Antiarrhythmic effects, such as supraventricular tachycardia prevention. Metoprolol also prevents electrical wave propagation. === Pharmacokinetics === Metoprolol is mostly absorbed from the intestine with an absorption fraction of 0.95. The systemic bioavailability after oral administration is approximately 50%. Less than 5% of an orally administered dose of metoprolol is excreted unchanged in urine; most of it is eliminated in metabolized form through feces via bile secretion into the intestines. Metoprolol undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, mainly α-hydroxylation and O-demethylation through various cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6 (primary), CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9. The primary metabolites formed are α-hydroxymetoprolol and O-demethylmetoprolol. Metoprolol is classified as a moderately lipophilic beta blocker. More lipophilic beta blockers tend to cross the blood–brain barrier more readily, with greater potential for effects in the central nervous system as well as associated neuropsychiatric side effects. Metoprolol binds mainly to human serum albumin with an unbound fraction of 0.88. It has a large volume of distribution at steady state (3.2 L/kg), indicating extensive distribution throughout the body. == Chemistry == Metoprolol was synthesized and its activity discovered in 1969. The specific agent in on-market formulations of metoprolol is either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate, where tartrate is an immediate-release formulation and the succinate is an extended-release formulation (with 100 mg metoprolol tartrate corresponding to 95 mg metoprolol succinate). === Stereochemistry === Metoprolol contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers. This is a racemate, i.e. a 1:1 mixture of (R)- and the (S)-form: == Society and culture == === Legal status === Metoprolol was approved for medical use in the United States in August 1978. === Economics === In the 2000s, a lawsuit was brought against the manufacturers of Toprol XL (a time-release formula version of metoprolol) and its generic equivalent (metoprolol succinate) claiming that to increase profits, lower cost generic versions of Toprol XL were intentionally kept off the market. It alleged that the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca AB, AstraZeneca LP, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, and Aktiebolaget Hassle violated antitrust and consumer protection law. In a settlement by the companies in 2012, without admission to the claims, they agreed to a settlement pay-out of US$ 11 million. === Sport === Because beta blockers can be used to reduce heart rate and minimize tremors, which can enhance performance in sports such as archery, metoprolol is banned by the world anti-doping agency in some sports. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2017).

141	Carvedilol	WIKIPEDIA	"Carvedilol, sold under the brand name Coreg among others, is a beta blocker medication, that may be prescribed for the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension) and chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (also known as HFrEF or systolic heart failure). Beta-blockers as a collective medication class are not recommended as routine first-line treatment of high blood pressure for all patients, due to evidence demonstrating less effective cardiovascular protection and a less favourable safety profile when compared to other classes of blood pressure-lowering medications. Common side effects include dizziness, tiredness, joint pain, low blood pressure, nausea, and shortness of breath. Severe side effects may include bronchospasm. Safety during pregnancy or breastfeeding is unclear. Use is not recommended in those with liver problems. Carvedilol is a nonselective beta blocker and alpha-1 blocker. How it improves outcomes is not entirely clear but may involve dilation of blood vessels. Carvedilol was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 34th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Carvedilol is indicated in the management of congestive heart failure (CHF), commonly as an adjunct to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and diuretics. It has been clinically shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations in people with CHF. The mechanism of carvedilol in heart failure is due to its inhibition of receptors in the adrenergic nervous system, which releases noradrenaline to the body, including the heart. Noradrenaline is a hormone that causes the heart to beat faster and work harder. Blocking its binding to adrenergic receptors in the heart causes vasodilation, decreases heart rate and blood pressure, and improves myocardial contractility, which ultimately decreases the heart's workload. Carvedilol reduces the risk of death, hospitalisations, and recurring heart attacks in patients with moderate to severe heart failure (with an ejection fraction <40%) following a heart attack Carvedilol has also been proven to reduce death and hospitalization in patients with severe heart failure. Carvedilol is not considered a first-line treatment for hypertension; however, research has demonstrated that it exhibits an antihypertensive effect when compared to a placebo or other antihypertensive medications. Carvedilol has shown efficacy in preventing bleeding from oesophageal varices in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis and may have benefit in avoiding successive bleeds. Carvedilol is used in the treatment of acute cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. overdose) with sympathomimetics, for instance caused by amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, or ephedrine. It has also specifically been found to block the sympathomimetic effects of MDMA. Dual α1 and beta blockers like carvedilol and labetalol may be more favorable for such purposes due to the possibility of ""unopposed α-stimulation"" with selective beta blockers. === Available forms === Carvedilol is available in the following forms: Oral tablet Extended-release (24-hour) oral capsule (approved by the FDA in 2006) == Contraindications == Carvedilol should not be used in patients with bronchial asthma or bronchospastic conditions due to increased risk of bronchoconstriction. It should not be used in people with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, severe bradycardia (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or a decompensated heart condition. People with severe hepatic impairment should use carvedilol with caution. == Side effects == The most common side effects (>10% incidence) of carvedilol include: Dizziness Fatigue Low blood pressure Diarrhea Weakness Slowed heart rate Weight gain Erectile dysfunction Carvedilol is not recommended for people with uncontrolled bronchospastic disease (e.g. current asthma symptoms) as it can block receptors that assist in opening the airways. Carvedilol may mask symptoms of low blood sugar, resulting in hypoglycemia unawareness. This is termed beta blocker induced hypoglycemia unawareness. == Interactions == The risk of bradycardia is increased if used with amiodarone, digoxin, diltiazem, ivabradine, or verapamil. Also, combination of carvedilol with non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, including diltiazem and verapamil, enhances it cardiodepressant effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Carvedilol is both a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist (β1, β2) and an α-adrenergic receptor antagonist (α1). The S(–) enantiomer accounts for the beta-blocking activity whereas the S(–) and R(+) enantiomers have alpha-blocking activity. The affinity (Ki) of carvedilol for the β-adrenergic receptors is 0.32 nM for the human β1-adrenergic receptor and 0.13 to 0.40 nM for the β2-adrenergic receptor. Using rat proteins, carvedilol has shown affinity for a variety of targets including the β1-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 0.24–0.43 nM), β2-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 0.19–0.25 nM), α1-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 3.4 nM), α2-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 2,168 nM), 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 3.4 nM), 5-HT2 receptor (Ki = 207 nM), H1 receptor (Ki = 3,034 nM), D2 receptor (Ki = 213 nM), μ-opioid receptor (Ki = 2,700 nM), veratridine site of voltage-gated sodium channels (IC50 = 1,260 nM), serotonin transporter (Ki = 528 nM), norepinephrine transporter (Ki = 2,406 nM), and dopamine transporter (Ki = 627 nM). It is an antagonist of the human 5-HT2A receptors with moderate affinity (Ki = 547 nM), although it is unclear if this is significant for its pharmacological actions given its much stronger activity at adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol reversibly binds to β-adrenergic receptors on cardiac myocytes. Inhibition of these receptors prevents a response to the sympathetic nervous system, leading to decreased heart rate and contractility. This action is beneficial in heart failure patients where the sympathetic nervous system is activated as a compensatory mechanism. Carvedilol blockade of α1-adrenergic receptors causes vasodilation of blood vessels. This inhibition leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance and an antihypertensive effect. There is no reflex tachycardia response due to carvedilol blockade of β1-adrenergic receptors on the heart. === Pharmacokinetics === Carvedilol is about 25% to 35% bioavailable following oral administration due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Absorption is slowed when administered with food, however, it does not show a significant difference in bioavailability. Taking carvedilol with food decreases the risk of orthostatic hypotension. The majority of carvedilol is bound to plasma proteins (98%), mainly to albumin. Carvedilol is a basic, hydrophobic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of 115 L. Plasma clearance ranges from 500 to 700 mL/min. Carvedilol is highly lipophilic and easily crosses the blood–brain barrier in animals, and hence is not thought to be peripherally selective. The compound is metabolized by liver enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 via aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation, then further conjugated by glucuronidation and sulfation. The three active metabolites exhibit only one-tenth of the vasodilating effect of the parent compound. However, the 4'-hydroxyphenyl metabolite is about 13-fold more potent in β-blockade than the parent. The mean elimination half-life of carvedilol following oral administration ranges from 7 to 10 hours. The pharmaceutical product is a mix of two enantiomorphs, R(+)-carvedilol and S(–)-carvedilol, with differing metabolic properties. R(+)-Carvedilol undergoes preferential selection for metabolism, which results in a fractional half-life of about 5 to 9 hours, compared with 7 to 11 hours for the S(-)-carvedilol fraction. == Chemistry == Carvedilol is a highly lipophilic compound with an experimental log P of 3.8 to 4.19 and a predicted log P of 3.05 to 4.2. == References == == Further reading == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
142	Ranolazine	WIKIPEDIA	Ranolazine, sold under the brand name Ranexa among others, is a medication used to treat heart related chest pain. Typically it is used together with other medications when those are insufficient. Therapeutic benefits appear smaller in females than males. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include constipation, headache, nausea, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include QT prolongation. Ranolazine is contraindicated (not recommended) in those with liver cirrhosis. How it works is not clear but may involve adenosine triphosphate. Ranolazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2006. In 2022, it was the 232nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ranolazine is used to treat chronic angina. It may be used concomitantly with β blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. It is also effective at preventing atrial fibrillation, and has been studied as monotherapy as well as in combination with other medications used to treat irregular heartbeat. Its use is not recommended in Scotland as of 2019. == Contraindications == Some contraindications for ranolazine are related to its metabolism and are described under Drug Interactions. Additionally, in clinical trials ranolazine slightly increased QT interval in some patients and the FDA label contains a warning for doctors to beware of this effect in their patients. The drug's effect on the QT interval is increased in the setting of liver dysfunction; thus it is contraindicated in persons with mild to severe liver disease. == Side effects == The most common side effects are dizziness (11.5%) and constipation (10.9%). Other side effects include headache and nausea. == Drug interactions == Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by the CYP3A enzyme. It also inhibits another metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome CYP2D6. For this reason, the doses of ranolazine and drugs that interact with those enzymes need to be adjusted when they are used by the same patient. Ranolazine should not be used with drugs such as ketoconazole, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir that strongly inhibit CYP3A, nor with drugs that activate CYP3A, such as rifampin and phenobarbital. For drugs that are moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as diltiazem, verapamil, and erythromycin, the dose of ranolazine should be reduced. Drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, such as tricyclic antidepressants, may need to be given at reduced doses when administered with ranolazine. == Mechanism of action == Ranolazine inhibits persistent or late inward sodium current (INa) in heart muscle in a variety of voltage-gated sodium channels. Inhibiting that current leads to reductions in intracellular calcium levels. This in turn leads to reduced tension in the heart wall, leading to reduced oxygen requirements for the muscle. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of IKr, which prolongs the ventricular action potential. Ranolazine also exhibits its effects on the delayed rectifier current (hERG/IKr potassium channels), it readily stimulates myogenesis, it reduces a pro-oxidant inflammation/oxidative condition, and activates the calcium signaling pathway. Ranolazine prolongs the action potential duration, with corresponding QT interval prolongation on electrocardiography, blocks the INa current, and prevents calcium overload caused by the hyperactive INa current, thus it stabilizes the membrane and reducing excitability. == History == Syntex Inc. originally began developing ranolazine in 1985 and 61 studies were completed from then until 1994. Afterwards, Phase 2 studies were done; however, it was found that the formulation did not result in adequate plasma concentrations of drug. It is due to this that the sustained-release (SR) formulation of ranolazine was created. Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 In 1996, CV Therapeutics licensed the North American and European rights to ranolazine from Syntex, a subsidiary of Roche, which had discovered the drug and had developed it through Phase II trials in angina. In 2006, CV Therapeutics acquired the remaining worldwide rights to ranolazine from Roche. In 2008 CV Therapeutics exclusively licensed rights for ranolazine in Europe and some other countries to Menarini. In 2009, Gilead acquired CV Therapeutics. In 2013 Gilead expanded the partnership with Menarini to include additional countries, including those in Asia. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Ranolazine was approved by the FDA in January 2006, for the treatment of patients with chronic angina as a second-line treatment in addition to other drugs. In 2007 the label was updated to make ranolazine a first-line treatment, alone or with other drugs. In April 2008 ranolazine was approved by the European EMEA for use in angina. === Commercial aspects === Ranolazine is manufactured and sold as Ranexa by Gilead.

145	Donepezil	WIKIPEDIA	"Donepezil, sold under the brand name Aricept among others, is a medication used to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type. It appears to result in a small benefit in mental function and ability to function. Use, however, has not been shown to change the progression of the disease. Treatment should be stopped if no benefit is seen. It is taken by mouth or via a transdermal patch. Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and structurally unrelated to other anticholinesterase agents. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, aggression, diarrhea, feeling tired, and muscle cramps. Serious side effects may include abnormal heart rhythms, urinary incontinence, and seizures. Donepezil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 146th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Alzheimer's disease === There is no evidence that donepezil or other similar agents alter the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease. Six-to-twelve-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition or behavior. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends donepezil as an option in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The person should, however, be reviewed frequently and if there is no significant benefit it should be stopped. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved donepezil for treatment of mild, moderate and severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease. === Other === Lewy body dementia: Some studies have shown benefits of donepezil for the treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Lewy body dementia. Traumatic brain injury: Some research suggests an improvement in memory dysfunction in patients with traumatic brain injury with donepezil use. Vascular dementia: Studies have shown that donepezil may improve cognition in patients with vascular dementia but not overall global functioning. Dementia associated with Parkinson disease: Some evidence suggests that donepezil can improve cognition, executive function, and global status in Parkinson disease dementia. == Adverse effects == In clinical trials the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Other side effects included difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps and loss of appetite. Most side effects were observed in patients taking the 23 mg dose compared to 10 mg or lower doses. Side effects are mild and transient in most patients, lasting up to three weeks and usually improved even with continued use. Donepezil, like other cholinesterase inhibitors, can cause nightmares due to enhanced activation of the visual association cortex during REM sleep. Dosing donepezil in the morning can reduce the frequency of nightmares. === Precautions === Donepezil should be used with caution in people with heart disease, cardiac conduction disturbances, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, severe cardiac arrhythmia and sick sinus syndrome. People with peptic ulcer disease or taking NSAIDs should use with caution because increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was noted. Slow heart beat and fainting in people with heart problems were also seen. These symptoms may appear more frequent when initiating treatment or increasing the donepezil dose. Although occurrence of seizures is rare, people who have a predisposition to seizures should be treated with caution. If daily donepezil has suspended for 7 days or less, restarting at the same dose is recommended, while if the suspension lasts longer than 7 days, retitrate from 5 mg daily is suggested. == Mechanism of action == Donepezil binds and reversibly inhibits enzymes called cholinesterases, especially acetylcholinesterase, thus inhibiting hydrolysis of acetylcholine. This increases acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic synapses. The precise mechanism of action of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood. Certainly, Alzheimer's disease involves a substantial loss of the elements of the cholinergic system and it is generally accepted that the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are related to this cholinergic deficit, particularly in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain. In addition to its actions as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil has been found to act as a potent agonist of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 14.6 nM), and has been shown to produce specific antiamnestic effects in animals mainly via this action. Some noncholinergic mechanisms have also been proposed. Donepezil upregulates the nicotinic receptors in the cortical neurons, adding to neuroprotective activity. It inhibits voltage-activated sodium currents reversibly and delays rectifier potassium currents and fast transient potassium currents, although this action is unlikely to contribute to clinical effects. == Synergy == Donepezil was claimed to act synergistically with an agent called FK962 [283167-06-6] & FK960 [133920-70-4]. {potential activation of somatostatinergic neurotransmission} However, the development was discontinued after Phase II ""since the data reviewed did not indicate clear efficacy of the compound for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."" == Stereochemistry == Donepezil medications are racemates. == History == Research leading to the development of donepezil began in 1983, at Eisai, and in 1996, Eisai received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for donepezil under the brand Aricept, which it co-marketed with Pfizer. The team at Eisai was led by Hachiro Sugimoto. As of 2011, Aricept was the world's best-selling Alzheimer's disease treatment. The first generic donepezil became available in November 2010, with the US FDA approval of a formulation prepared by Ranbaxy Labs. == Research == Donepezil has been tested in other cognitive disorders, including Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia, but it is not currently approved for these indications. Donepezil has also been found to improve sleep apnea in people with Alzheimer's. It also improves gait in people with mild Alzheimer's. Donepezil has also been studied in people with mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, post-coronary artery bypass surgery cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment associated with multiple sclerosis, CADASIL syndrome, and Down syndrome. A three-year National Institutes of Health trial in people with mild cognitive impairment reported donepezil was superior to placebo in delaying rate of progression to dementia during the initial 18 months of the study, but this was not sustained at 36 months. In a secondary analysis, a subgroup of individuals with the apolipoprotein E4 genotype showed sustained benefits with donepezil throughout the study. At this time, though, donepezil is not indicated for prevention of dementia. === Cognitive enhancement === Donepezil has shown mixed results for improving cognitive abilities in healthy individuals. A 2009 double-blind, placebo controlled study (n=24) investigating donepezil's effects across a variety of memory tests in reported an improvement in spatial memory accuracy both before (90 minutes after dosing) and at theoretical Tmax (210 minutes after dosing). However, a later 2011 paper featuring two study double-blind, placebo controlled experiments evaluating donepezil's effects in older but healthy subjects reported impairment after acute (5 hours after dose) and chronic (4 weeks) donepezil administration. === ADHD === The addition of donepezil with existing ADHD medications has shown mixed results. In those with Tourette syndrome and ADHD, donepezil may reduce tics while it had no effect on ADHD's symptoms. === Pervasive developmental disorder === Donepezil, along with other cholinesterase inhibitors, is suggested as having potential for trouble behaviors: irritability, hyperactivity, and difficulty in social communication which are typically seen in those with pervasive developmental disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and autism-spectrum disorder. === Anorexia nervosa === Donepezil is furthermore suggested as a feasible therapeutic option for anorexia nervosa. Emerging literature reports that a subset of patients suffering from restrictive anorexia nervosa have enhanced habit formation compared with healthy controls. Habit formation is modulated by striatal cholinergic interneurons. Based on the physiopathology of anorexia nervosa, namely in terms of cholinergic deficiencies, the effects of donepezil and other drugs that act as cholinesterase inhibitors could thus be effective in the treatment of the disorder. However, no trial to date supports this hypothesis. == References == == Further reading == Brenner GD, Brenner GM (2000). Pharmacology. Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders. ISBN 978-0-7216-7757-6.

147	Vanillylmandelic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) is a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of artificial vanilla flavorings and is an end-stage metabolite of the catecholamines (epinephrine, and norepinephrine). It is produced via intermediary metabolites. == Chemical synthesis == VMA synthesis is the first step of a two-step process practiced by Rhodia since the 1970s to synthesize artificial vanilla. Specifically the reaction entails the condensation of guaiacol and glyoxylic acid in an ice cold, aqueous solution with sodium hydroxide. == Biological elimination == VMA is found in the urine, along with other catecholamine metabolites, including homovanillic acid (HVA), metanephrine, and normetanephrine. In timed urine tests the quantity excreted (usually per 24 hours) is assessed along with creatinine clearance, and the quantity of cortisols, catecholamines, and metanephrines excreted is also measured. == Clinical significance == Urinary VMA is elevated in patients with tumors that secrete catecholamines. These urinalysis tests are used to diagnose an adrenal gland tumor called pheochromocytoma, a tumor of catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells. These tests may also be used to diagnose neuroblastomas, and to monitor treatment of these conditions. Norepinephrine is metabolised into normetanephrine and VMA. Norepinephrine is one of the hormones produced by the adrenal glands, which are found on top of the kidneys. These hormones are released into the blood during times of physical or emotional stress, which are factors that may skew the results of the test. == References ==	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.004432255, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -1.2948405e-05, ' MED': -0.034777775, 'ICAL': 0.0}
149	Morphinan, 3-methoxy-	PUBMED	 Morphinan derivatives lacking the 4,5-epoxy ring were synthesized to examine the participation of the 14-OH group, the 3-OMe group, and the aromaticity of the A-ring in the activity and selectivity for the orexin 1 receptor (OX Herein we describe a Free-Wilson/Fujita-Ban QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) analysis of the analgesic potency of over 50 semisynthetic opioid narcotics. The 3-hydroxy- and 3-methoxy-N-alkylmorphinan-6-ones of B/C-cis and -trans stereochemistry include compounds exhibiting structural variation at five positions [N-methyl (C17), oxygen at C3, C4-C5 oxygen bridge, alkyl substituents at C7 and C8]. The pharmacological parameter correlated was the analgesic potency (-log ED50) exhibited on abdominal contractions produced by acetylcholine injection in mice. A satisfactory correlation was obtained only by assuming interdependent contributions of the substituents on C17 and O(C3), with which it was possible to explain 75% of the variance. Phenolic compounds (3-OH) behave somewhat differently from the methyl ethers (3-OCH3), and in both series the substituents on C8 have a size-dependent negative contribution, implying steric hindrance at their contact point on the receptor. With use of this correlation the potency of five further members of the series was predicted. Subsequent testing fully confirmed the validity of the correlation since the measured potencies were, within experimental error, equal to those calculated. In a further refinement, phenolic compounds were considered separately from the ethers, and it was found that the contribution of the substituents on C17, C7, and C8 remained similar in sign and magnitude but not that of the furan oxygen. This analysis allows us to conclude that if both phenolic and nonphenolic members of this series act on the same receptor they must bind at different subsites or in alternate modes, supporting an earlier proposal in the literature.

151	Verapamil	WIKIPEDIA	"Verapamil, sold under various trade names, is a calcium channel blocker medication used for the treatment of high blood pressure, angina (chest pain from not enough blood flow to the heart), and supraventricular tachycardia. It may also be used for the prevention of migraines and cluster headaches. It is given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, low blood pressure, nausea, and constipation. Other side effects include allergic reactions and muscle pains. It is not recommended in people with a slow heart rate or heart failure. It is believed to cause problems for the fetus if used during pregnancy. It is in the non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker family of medications. Verapamil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Verapamil is available as a generic medication. Long acting formulations exist. In 2022, it was the 188th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Verapamil is used for controlling ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and migraine headache prevention. Verapamil is also used for the treatment of angina (chronic stable, vasospastic or Prinzmetal variant), unstable angina (crescendo, preinfarction), and for the prevention of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Verapamil is a class-IV antiarrhythmic and more effective than digoxin in controlling ventricular rate. Verapamil is not listed as a first line antihypertensive agent by the guidelines provided by JAMA in JNC-8. However, it may be used to treat hypertension if patient has co-morbid atrial fibrillation or other types of arrhythmia. Verapamil is used intra-arterially to treat cerebral vasospasm. It is also used to treat cluster headaches. Tentative evidence supports the use of verapamil topically to treat plantar fibromatosis. Use of verapamil in people with recent onset of type 1 diabetes may improve pancreatic beta cell function. In a 2023 meta-analysis involving data from two randomized controlled trials (113 patients with recent onset type-1 diabetes), it was demonstrated that the use of verapamil over one year was associated with significantly higher C-peptide area under the curve levels. Higher C-peptide levels means better pancreatic insulin production and beta cell function. Verapamil has been reported to be effective in both short-term and long-term treatment of mania and hypomania. Addition of magnesium oxide to the verapamil treatment protocol enhances the antimanic effect. == Contraindications == Use of verapamil is generally avoided in people with severe left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), cardiogenic shock, and hypersensitivity to verapamil. It is also contraindicated in people with atrial flutter or fibrillation and an existing accessory tract such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. == Side effects == The most common side effect of verapamil is constipation (7.3%). While the definite mechanism by which verapamil causes constipation has not been studied, studies have been conducted to rule out mechanisms of actions that might yield this adverse effect. A study by The National Library of Medicine called ""Effect of Verapamil on the Human Intestinal Transit"" found that verapamil affects the colon but not the upper gastrointestinal tract. Other side effects include dizziness (3.3%), nausea (2.7%), low blood pressure (2.5%), and headache 2.2%. Other side effects seen in less than 2% of the population include: edema, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, diarrhea, fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, shortness of breath, low heart rate, atrioventricular block, rash and flushing. Along with other calcium channel blockers, verapamil is known to induce gingival enlargement. === Overdose === Acute overdose is often manifested by nausea, weakness, slow heart rate, dizziness, low blood pressure, and abnormal heart rhythms. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of verapamil and norverapamil, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Blood or plasma verapamil concentrations are usually in a range of 50–500 μg/L in persons on therapy with the drug, but may rise to 1–4 mg/L in acute overdose patients and are often at levels of 5–10 mg/L in fatal poisonings. == Mechanism of action == Verapamil's mechanism in all cases is to block voltage-dependent calcium channels. In cardiac pharmacology, calcium channel blockers are considered class-IV antiarrhythmic agents. Since calcium channels are especially concentrated in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, these agents can be used to decrease impulse conduction through the AV node, thus protecting the ventricles from atrial tachyarrhythmias. Specific conditions that fall under the definition of atrial tachyarrhythmias are atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and so on. Verapamil is also a Kv voltage gated potassium channel blocker. Calcium channels are also present in the smooth muscle lining blood vessels. By relaxing the tone of this smooth muscle, calcium channel blockers dilate the blood vessels. This has led to their use in treating high blood pressure and angina pectoris. The pain of angina is caused by a deficit in oxygen supply to the heart. Calcium channel blockers like verapamil dilate the coronary blood vessels, which increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. They also cause dilatation of systemic peripheral vessels as well, causing a reduction in the workload of the heart. Thereby reducing myocardial oxygen consumption. === Cluster headaches === Preventive therapy with verapamil is believed to work because it has an effect on the circadian rhythm and on CGRPs, as CGRP-release is controlled by voltage-gated calcium channels. == Pharmacokinetic details == More than 90% of verapamil is absorbed when given orally, but due to high first-pass metabolism, bioavailability is much lower (10–35%). It is 90% bound to plasma proteins and has a volume of distribution of 3–5 L/kg. It takes 1 to 2 hours to reach peak plasma concentration after oral administration. It is metabolized in the liver to at least 12 inactive metabolites (though one metabolite, norverapamil, retains 20% of the vasodilatory activity of the parent drug). As its metabolites, 70% is excreted in the urine and 16% in feces; 3–4% is excreted unchanged in urine. This is a nonlinear dependence between plasma concentration and dosage. Onset of action is 1 to 2 hours after oral dosage, and 3 to 5 minutes after intravenous bolus dosage. Biphasic or triphasic following IV administration; terminal elimination half-life is 2–8 hours. Plasma half-life of 2–8 or 4.5–12 hours after single oral dose or multiple oral doses, respectively. It is not cleared by hemodialysis. It is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued while verapamil is administered. == Veterinary use == Intra-abdominal adhesions are common in rabbits following surgery. Verapamil can be given postoperatively in rabbits which have suffered trauma to abdominal organs to prevent formation of these adhesions. Such effect was not documented in another study with ponies. == Uses in cell biology == Verapamil inhibits the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family of proteins found in stem cells and has been used to study cancer stem cells (CSC) within head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Verapamil is also used in cell biology as an inhibitor of drug efflux pump proteins such as P-glycoprotein and other ABC transporter proteins. This is useful, as many tumor cell lines overexpress drug efflux pumps, limiting the effectiveness of cytotoxic drugs or fluorescent tags. It is also used in fluorescent cell sorting for DNA content, as it blocks efflux of a variety of DNA-binding fluorophores such as Hoechst 33342. Radioactively labelled verapamil and positron emission tomography can be used with to measure P-glycoprotein function. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
152	Pterostilbene	WIKIPEDIA	"Pterostilbene () (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystilbene) is a stilbenoid chemically related to resveratrol. In plants, it serves a defensive phytoalexin role. == Natural occurrence == Pterostilbene is found in almonds, various Vaccinium berries (including blueberries), grape leaves and vines, and Pterocarpus marsupium heartwood. == Safety and regulation == Pterostilbene is considered to be a corrosive substance, is dangerous upon exposure to the eyes, and is an environmental toxin, especially to aquatic life. A preliminary study of healthy human subjects given pterostilbene for 6–8 weeks, showed pterostilbene to be safe for human use at dosages up to 250 mg per day, although this study did not assess metabolic effects on the lipid profile. Other studies have reported dose-based elevations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, ""bad cholesterol"") and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, ""good cholesterol"") within 4 to 8 weeks of daily dosing. The elevation of LDL-C may move previously normal ranges into borderline high or high reference range and has raised questions about the longterm cardiovascular risk of pterostilbene supplementation in humans. Its chemical relative, resveratrol, received FDA GRAS status in 2007, and approval of synthetic resveratrol as a safe compound by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2016. Pterostilbene differs from resveratrol by exhibiting increased bioavailability (80% compared to 20% in resveratrol) due to the presence of two methoxy groups which cause it to exhibit increased lipophilic and oral absorption. == Research == Pterostilbene is being studied in laboratory and preliminary clinical research. == See also == Piceatannol, a stilbenoid related to both resveratrol and pterostilbene == References =="	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -0.00012666137, 'OD': 0.0}
153	Palmatine	WIKIPEDIA	Palmatine is a protoberberine alkaloid found in several plants including Coptis Chinensis (Rhizoma coptidis, chinese goldthread), Corydalis yanhusuo, Tinospora cordifolia (gurjo, heart-leaved moonseed), Tinospora sagittata, Phellodendron amurense (amur cork tree), and Stephania yunnanensis. It is the major component of the protoberberine extract from Enantia chlorantha. It has been studied for its potential use in the treatment of jaundice, dysentery, hypertension, inflammation, and liver-related diseases. This compound also has weak in vitro activity against flavivirus. == Pharmacology == === Neuroprotective activity === Palmatine can be used to treat Alzheimer’s disease, mainly by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and neuraminidase-1 (NA-1). It was found, that the positively charged nitrogen on palmatine binds in the gorge of active sire of AChE. Research show that palmatine had antidepressant effect. It was achieved by regulating brain catalase levels, monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) activity, lipid peroxidation, plasma nitrite and corticosterone levels. === Regulating blood lipid activity === Palmatine achieved hypoglycemic effects by inducing insulin release and insulin-mimicking activity. In addition, studies found that palmatine also inhibited the activity of lens aldose reductase, sucrase and maltase. In vivo research showed that palmatine reduced serum total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) and increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. === Anticancer activity === Research showed that palmatine had broad anti-cancer activity. Palmatine had significant growth inhibitory effects on seven human cancer cell lines: 7701QGY, SMMC7721, HepG2, CEM, CEM/VCR, K III and Lewis. In addition, palmatine also had anti-cancer activity on MCF-7, U251, KB, CHOK-1, HT-29 and SiHacell lines. Palmatine induced apoptosis in human skin epithelial carcinoma cells (A431) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner via damaging severely to DNA and inhibiting the activity of Bcl-2 protein. In addition, palmatine can inhibit the proliferation and infiltration of cancer cells. === Antibacterial and antiviral activity === Palmitine has inhibitory effect on Gram-positive bacteria which is significantly stronger than that on Gram-negative bacteria, and 9-O-substituted palmatine derivatives exhibited stronger antibacterial activity. === Anti-inflammatory activity === Studies have shown that palmatine can decrease the production of pro-inflammatory factors and increase the production of anti-inflammatory factors. === Other pharmacological activity === Studies have shown that palmatine chave antioxidant activity, had a protective effect on gastric ulcer, derivatives of palmatine were more effective against ulcerative colitis, including low cytotoxicity to intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, palmatine might have the antiarrhythmic effect, and provideprotection from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. == Toxicity == A large number of studies have shown that palmatine has a complex effect on the metabolism of enzymes in the liver, and that palmatine has significant DNA toxicity. However, some 9-O-substituted palmatine derivatives exhibited less toxic than palmatine. In addition, palmatine had higher affinity to nucleic acids than serum proteins, which make them suitable candidates for delivery by serum proteins. == See also == Berberine Jatrorrhizine Phellodendrine == References ==	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -1.7835755e-05, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.11193228, ' FOOD': -0.0004923874}
154	Berberine	WIKIPEDIA	Berberine is a quaternary ammonium salt from the protoberberine group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, occurring naturally as a secondary metabolite in some plants including species of Berberis, from which its name is derived. Due to their yellow pigmentation, raw Berberis materials were once commonly used to dye wool, leather, and wood. Under ultraviolet light, berberine shows a strong yellow fluorescence, making it useful in histology for staining heparin in mast cells. As a natural dye, berberine has a color index of 75160. == Research == Studies on the pharmacological effects of berberine, including its potential use as a medicine, are preliminary basic research: some studies are conducted on cell cultures or animal models, whereas clinical trials investigating the use of berberine in humans are limited. A 2023 review study stated that berberine may improve lipid concentrations. High-quality, large clinical studies are needed to properly evaluate the effectiveness and safety of berberine in various health conditions, because existing studies are insufficient to draw reliable conclusions. Berberine supplements are widely available in the U.S. but have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any specific medical use. Researchers publicly warn that studies linking berberine to supposed health benefits are limited. Furthermore, the quality of berberine supplements can vary between different brands. A study conducted in 2017 found that out of 15 different products sold in the U.S., only six contained at least 90% of specified berberine amount. == Biological sources == Berberis vulgaris (barberry) Berberis aristata (tree turmeric) Berberis thunbergii Fibraurea tinctoria Mahonia aquifolium (Oregon grape) Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal) Xanthorhiza simplicissima (yellowroot) Phellodendron amurense (Amur cork tree) Coptis chinensis (Chinese goldthread) Tinospora cordifolia Argemone mexicana (prickly poppy) Eschscholzia californica (California poppy) Berberine is usually found in the roots, rhizomes, stems, and bark. == Biosynthesis == The alkaloid berberine has a tetracyclic skeleton derived from a benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline system with the incorporation of an extra carbon atom as a bridge. Formation of the berberine bridge is rationalized as an oxidative process in which the N-methyl group, supplied by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), is oxidized to an iminium ion, and a cyclization to the aromatic ring occurs by virtue of the phenolic group. Reticuline is the immediate precursor of protoberberine alkaloids in plants. Berberine is an alkaloid derived from tyrosine. L-DOPA and 4-hydroxypyruvic acid both come from L-tyrosine. Although two tyrosine molecules are used in the biosynthetic pathway, only the phenethylamine fragment of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring system is formed via DOPA; the remaining carbon atoms come from tyrosine via 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. == References ==	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.07686665, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' FOOD': -1.6882126e-05}

This medicine is also sometimes used for neuropathic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), smoking cessation and anxiety. Its use for young people with depression and other psychiatric disorders may be limited due to increased suicidality in the 18–24 population initiating treatment. Nortriptyline is not a preferred treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or smoking cessation. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurry vision, sleepiness, low blood pressure with standing, and weakness. Serious side effects may include seizures, an increased risk of suicide in those less than 25 years of age, urinary retention, glaucoma, mania, and a number of heart issues. Nortriptyline may cause problems if taken during pregnancy. Use during breastfeeding appears to be relatively safe. It is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and is believed to work by altering levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Nortriptyline was approved for medical use in the United States in 1964. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 191st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Nortriptyline is used to treat depression. A level between 50 and 150 ng/mL of nortriptyline in the blood generally corresponds with an antidepressant effect. It is also used off-label for the treatment of panic disorder, ADHD, irritable bowel syndrome, tobacco-cessation, migraine prophylaxis and chronic pain or neuralgia modification, particularly temporomandibular joint disorder. === Irritable bowel syndrome === Nortriptyline has also been used as an off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). == Contraindications == Nortriptyline should not be used in the acute recovery phase after myocardial infarction (heart attack). Use of tricyclic antidepressants along with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), linezolid, or IV methylene blue are contraindicated as it can cause an increased risk of developing serotonin syndrome. Closer monitoring is required for those with a history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, glaucoma, or seizures, as well as in persons with hyperthyroidism or receiving thyroid hormones. == Side effects == The most common side effects include dry mouth, sedation, constipation, increased appetite, blurred vision and tinnitus. An occasional side effect is a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Alcohol may exacerbate some of its side effects. == Overdose == The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are generally the same as for the other tricyclic antidepressants, including anticholinergic effects, serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. TCAs, particularly nortriptyline, have a relatively narrow therapeutic index, which increase the chance of an overdose (both accidental and intentional). Symptoms of overdose include: irregular heartbeat, seizures, coma, confusion, hallucination, widened pupils, drowsiness, agitation, fever, low body temperature, stiff muscles and vomiting. == Interactions == Excessive consumption of alcohol in combination with nortriptyline therapy may have a potentiating effect, which may lead to the danger of increased suicidal attempts or overdosage, especially in patients with histories of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation. It may interact with the following drugs: heart rhythm medications such as flecainide (Tambocor), propafenone (Rhythmol), or quinidine (Cardioquin, Quinidex, Quinaglute) cimetidine guanethidine reserpine == Pharmacology == Nortriptyline is a strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and a moderate serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Its pharmacologic profile is as the table shows with (inhibition or antagonism of all sites). === Pharmacodynamics === Nortriptyline is an active metabolite of amitriptyline by demethylation in the liver. Chemically, it is a secondary amine dibenzocycloheptene and pharmacologically it is classed as a first-generation antidepressant. Nortriptyline may also have a sleep-improving effect due to antagonism of the H1 and 5-HT2A receptors. In the short term, however, nortriptyline may disturb sleep due to its activating effect. In one study, nortriptyline had the highest affinity for the dopamine transporter among the tricyclic antidepressants (KD = 1,140 nM) besides amineptine (a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor), although its affinity for this transporter was still 261- and 63-fold lower than for the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters (KD = 4.37 and 18 nM, respectively). === Pharmacogenetics === Nortriptyline is metabolized in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6, and genetic variations within the gene coding for this enzyme can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of nortriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have ""normal"" metabolism of nortriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use nortriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding nortriptyline in persons who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. If use of nortriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommends reducing the dose of nortriptyline in CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or increasing the dose in ultrarapid metabolizers. == Chemistry == Nortriptyline is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene tricyclic antidepressants include amitriptyline (N-methylnortriptyline), protriptyline, and butriptyline. Nortriptyline is a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant, with its N-methylated parent amitriptyline being a tertiary amine. Other secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants include desipramine and protriptyline. The chemical name of nortriptyline is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N-methyl-1-propanamine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21N1 with a molecular weight of 263.384 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 72-69-5 and of the hydrochloride is 894-71-3. == History == Nortriptyline was developed by Geigy. It first appeared in the literature in 1962 and was patented the same year. The drug was first introduced for the treatment of depression in 1963. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Nortriptyline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while nortriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are nortriptilina, in German is nortriptylin, and in Latin is nortriptylinum. === Brand names === Brand names of nortriptyline include Allegron, Aventyl, Noritren, Norpress, Nortrilen, Norventyl, Norzepine, Pamelor, and Sensival, among many others. == Research == Although not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neuropathic pain, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants for the treatment of this condition in both depressed and non-depressed individuals. In 2010, an evidence-based guideline sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Pain recommended nortriptyline as a first-line medication for neuropathic pain. However, in a 2015 Cochrane systematic review the authors did not recommend nortriptyline as a first-line agent for neuropathic pain. It may be effective in the treatment of tobacco-cessation. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
168	Duloxetine	WIKIPEDIA	"Duloxetine, sold under the brand name Cymbalta among others, is a medication used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain and central sensitization. It is taken by mouth. Duloxetine is a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The precise mechanism for its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects is not known. Common side effects include dry mouth, nausea, feeling tired, dizziness, agitation, sexual problems, and increased sweating. Severe side effects include an increased risk of suicide, serotonin syndrome, mania, and liver problems. Antidepressant withdrawal syndrome may occur if stopped. There are concerns that use during the later part of pregnancy can harm the developing fetus. Duloxetine was approved for medical use in the United States and the European Union in 2004. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 31st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 18 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == The main uses of duloxetine are in major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, neuropathic pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and fibromyalgia. Duloxetine is recommended as a first-line agent for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, as a first-line therapy for fibromyalgia in the presence of mood disorders by the German Interdisciplinary Association for Pain Therapy, as a Grade B recommendation for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy by the American Association for Neurology and as a level A recommendation in certain neuropathic states by the European Federation of Neurological Societies. === Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy === A 2014 Cochrane review concluded that duloxetine is beneficial in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia but that more comparative studies with other medicines are needed. The French medical journal Prescrire concluded that duloxetine is no better than other available agents and has a greater risk of side effects. Whereas duloxetine has shown efficacy in treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy by blocking late Nav 1.7 sodium ion channels and increasing norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine in the central nervous system (CNS) and while improving mean NPRS scores and achieving a ≥50% pain response in more patients compared to placebo, it has been associated with potentially serious adverse reactions including hepatotoxicity, serotonin syndrome, severe skin reactions, increased risk of bleeding, increased blood pressure and sexual dysfunction. === Major depressive disorder === Duloxetine was approved for the treatment of major depression in 2004. While duloxetine has demonstrated improvement in depression-related symptoms compared to placebo, comparisons of duloxetine to other antidepressant medications have been less successful. A 2012 Cochrane Review did not find greater efficacy of duloxetine compared to SSRIs and newer antidepressants. Additionally, the review found evidence that duloxetine has increased side effects and reduced tolerability compared to other antidepressants. It thus did not recommend duloxetine as a first-line treatment for major depressive disorder, given the (then) high cost of duloxetine compared to inexpensive off-patent antidepressants and lack of increased efficacy. Duloxetine appears less tolerable than some other antidepressants. Generic duloxetine became available in 2013. === Generalized anxiety disorder === Duloxetine is more effective than placebo in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). A review from the Annals of Internal Medicine lists duloxetine among the first line drug treatments along with citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, and venlafaxine. === Neuropathic pain === Duloxetine was approved for the pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) by the US FDA. The response is achieved in the first two weeks on the medication. Duloxetine slightly increased the fasting serum glucose. The comparative efficacy of duloxetine and established pain-relief medications for diabetic peripheral neuropathy is unclear. A systematic review noted that tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine and amitriptyline), traditional anticonvulsants and opioids have better efficacy than duloxetine. Duloxetine, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants have similar tolerability while opioids cause more side effects. Another review in Prescrire International considered the moderate pain relief achieved with duloxetine to be clinically insignificant and the results of the clinical trials unconvincing. The reviewer saw no reason to prescribe duloxetine in practice. The comparative data collected by reviewers in BMC Neurology indicated that amitriptyline, other tricyclic antidepressants, and venlafaxine may be more effective. The authors noted that the evidence in favor of duloxetine is much more solid, however. A Cochrane review concluded that the evidence in support of duloxetine's efficacy in treating painful diabetic neuropathy was adequate and that further trials should focus on comparisons with other medications. A crossover trial found that duloxetine, pregabalin, and amitriptyline offered similar levels of pain relief. Duloxetin also has similar effect on pain relief in diabetic neuropathic pain as gabapentin. Comparing at various doses, the strongest effect on relieving diabetic neuropatic pain is on 120 mg/d dose. Combination treatment of duloxetine and pregabalin offered additional pain relief for people whose pain is not adequately controlled with one medication and was safe. Duloxetine is also an option for the management of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis patients. === Fibromyalgia and chronic pain === A review of duloxetine found that it reduced pain and fatigue, and improved physical and mental performance compared to placebo. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for the treatment of fibromyalgia in June 2008. It may be useful for chronic pain from osteoarthritis. In November 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved duloxetine to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain, including discomfort from osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain. === Stress urinary incontinence === Duloxetine failed to receive US approval for stress urinary incontinence amid concerns over liver toxicity and suicidal events; it was approved for this use in the UK, however, where it is recommended as an add-on medication in stress urinary incontinence instead of surgery. The safety and utility of duloxetine in the treatment of incontinence have been evaluated in a series of meta-analyses and practice guidelines. A 2017 meta-analysis found that the harms are at least as great if not greater than the benefits. A 2013 meta-analysis concluded that duloxetine decreased incontinence episodes more than placebo with people about 56% more likely than placebo to experience a 50% decrease in episodes. Adverse effects were experienced by 83% of duloxetine-treated subjects and by 45% of placebo-treated subjects. A 2012 review and practice guideline published by the European Association of Urology concluded that the clinical trial data provides Grade 1a evidence that duloxetine improves but does not cure urinary incontinence and that it causes a high rate of gastrointestinal side effects (mainly nausea and vomiting) leading to a high rate of treatment discontinuation. The National Institute for Clinical and Health Excellence recommends (as of September 2013) that duloxetine not be routinely offered as first-line treatment, and that it only be offered as second-line therapy in women wishing to avoid therapy. The guideline further states that women should be counseled regarding the drug's side effects. == Contraindications == The following contraindications are listed by the manufacturer: Hypersensitivity: duloxetine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to duloxetine or any of the inactive ingredients. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): concomitant use in patients taking MAOIs is contraindicated. Uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma: in clinical trials, Cymbalta use was associated with an increased risk of mydriasis (dilation of the pupil); therefore, its use should be avoided in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma, in which mydriasis can cause sudden worsening. Central nervous system (CNS) acting drugs: given the primary CNS effects of duloxetine, it should be used with caution when it is taken in combination with or substituted for other centrally acting drugs, including those with a similar mechanism of action. Duloxetine and thioridazine should not be co-administered. In addition, the FDA has reported on life-threatening drug interactions that may be possible when co-administered with triptans and other drugs acting on serotonin pathways leading to increased risk for serotonin syndrome. Duloxetine should also be avoided in hepatic impairment such as cirrhosis. == Adverse effects == Nausea, somnolence, insomnia, and dizziness are the main side effects, reported by about 10% to 20% of patients. In a trial for major depressive disorder (MDD), the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events among duloxetine-treated patients were nausea (34.7%), dry mouth (22.7%), headache (20.0%) and dizziness (18.7%), and except for headache, these were reported significantly more often than in the placebo group. In a long-term study of fibromyalgia patients receiving duloxetine, frequency and type of adverse effects was similar to that reported in the MDD trial above. Side effects tended to be mild-to-moderate, and tended to decrease in intensity over time. === Sexual dysfunction === In four clinical trials of duloxetine for the treatment of MDD, sexual dysfunction occurred significantly more frequently in patients treated with duloxetine than those treated with placebo, and this difference occurred only in men. Specifically, common side effects include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and anorgasmia (trouble achieving orgasm). Loss of or decreased response to sexual stimuli and ejaculatory anhedonia are also reported. Frequency of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction were similar for duloxetine and SSRIs when compared in a 6-month observational study in depressed patients. Rates of sexual dysfunction in MDD patients treated with duloxetine versus escitalopram did not differ significantly at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment, although the trend favored duloxetine (33.3% of duloxetine patients experienced sexual side effects compared to 43.6% of those receiving escitalopram and 25% of those receiving placebo). === Increased sweating === Duloxetine may also cause sweating more than usual (hyperhidrosis). The exact mechanism behind why duloxetine increases sweating is still not fully understood. However, a possible explanation is in duloxetine's action on the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic nerves control thermoregulation and sweating in humans; when increased levels of noradrenaline are present (as seen with SNRIs), this can stimulate sweat gland activity, leading to an increase in perspiration. Noradrenaline release may also cause increased serotonin availability that results from inhibiting reuptake. Such release enhances and further facilitates the activation of post-synaptic α-adrenoceptors by noradrenaline, which can stimulate sweat gland activity, leading to more significant amounts of copious liquid secretion mainly at higher duloxetine dosages above certain thresholds. The amount of sweating experienced may be influenced by the noradrenergic tone, which is determined by the interaction between noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Therefore, at higher serum doses or concentrations (above certain thresholds) resulting from therapeutic antidepressant treatment, patients may show more perspiration than at lower doses. === Discontinuation syndrome === During marketing of other SSRIs and SNRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as brain zap electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. The withdrawal syndrome from duloxetine resembles the SSRI discontinuation syndrome. When discontinuing treatment with duloxetine, the manufacturer recommends a gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to nine weeks' duration of patients with MDD, a systematic evaluation of discontinuation symptoms in patients taking duloxetine following abrupt discontinuation found the following symptoms occurring at a rate greater than or equal to 2% and at a significantly higher rate in duloxetine-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, nausea, headache, paresthesia, vomiting, irritability, and nightmare. In 2012 The Institute for Safe Medical Practices (ISMP) published a report: ""Duloxetine and Serious Withdrawal Symptoms"". The report highlights early clinical studies which found ""abrupt discontinuation showed that withdrawal effects occurred in 40-50% of patients, that 10% of those were severe and approximately half were not resolved when side effects monitoring had ended after one or two weeks"". Withdrawal symptoms listed in 48 case reports (in the first quarter of 2012) included anger, crying, dizziness, and suicidal ideation. The report concluded there was insufficient information and a lack of clear warnings about the effects of discontinuing duloxetine and that in many cases withdrawal symptoms may be ""severe, persistent, or both"", adding ""the prescribing information for physicians and pharmacists does not provide realistic schedules for tapering or a clear picture of the likely incidence of these reactions"". === Suicidality === In the United States all antidepressants, including duloxetine carry a black box warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 2-fold increase in the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase in suicidality in the 18–24 age group. To obtain statistically significant results the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications. As suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical trials are rare, the results for any drug taken separately usually do not reach statistical significance. In 2005, the United States FDA released a public health advisory noting that there had been eleven reports of suicide attempts and three reports of suicidality within the mostly middle-aged women participating in the open-label extension trials of duloxetine for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The FDA described the potential role of confounding social stressors as ""unclear"". The suicide attempt rate in the SUI study population (based on 9,400 patients) was calculated to be 400 per 100,000 person-years. This rate is greater than the suicide attempt rate among middle-aged US women that has been reported in published studies, i.e., 150 to 160 per 100,000 person-years. In addition, one death from suicide was reported in a Cymbalta clinical pharmacology study in a healthy female volunteer without SUI. No increase in suicidality was reported in controlled trials of Cymbalta for depression or diabetic neuropathic pain. === Postmarketing reports === Reported adverse events that were temporally correlated to duloxetine therapy include rash, reported rarely, and the following adverse events, reported very rarely: alanine aminotransferase increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema, aspartate aminotransferase increased, bilirubin increased, glaucoma, hepatotoxicity, hyponatremia, jaundice, orthostatic hypotension (especially at the initiation of treatment), Stevens–Johnson syndrome, syncope (especially at initiation of treatment), and urticaria. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Duloxetine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine (NE) in the central nervous system. Duloxetine increases dopamine (DA) specifically in the prefrontal cortex, where there are few DA reuptake pumps, via the inhibition of NE reuptake pumps (NET), which is believed to mediate the reuptake of DA and NE. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA reuptake transporters, however, and can therefore be considered to be a selective reuptake inhibitor at the 5-HT and NE transporters. Duloxetine undergoes extensive metabolism, but the major circulating metabolites do not contribute significantly to the pharmacologic activity. In vitro binding studies using synaptosomal preparations isolated from rat cerebral cortex indicated that duloxetine was approximately 3 fold more potent at inhibiting serotonin uptake than norepinephrine uptake. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Duloxetine is acid labile, and is formulated with an enteric coating to prevent degradation in the stomach. Duloxetine has good oral bioavailability, averaging 50% after one 60 mg dose. There is an average 2-hour lag until absorption begins with maximum plasma concentrations occurring about 6 hours post-dose. Food or bedtime administration has no significant impact on the Cmax of duloxetine, but delay time to reach peak concentration by 4 hours. This delay is caused by reduced gastrointestinal motility, and reduce area under curve and half-life by only 11% and 18%, respectively; as such, no dose adjustments or time-of-day restrictions are necessary. Depending on condition being treated, duloxetine is taken once a day or twice a day. ==== Distribution ==== Duloxetine is highly bound (>90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Volume of distribution is about 1640 L. ==== Metabolism ==== Duloxetine undergoes predominately hepatic metabolism via two cytochrome P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Circulating metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. Duloxetine is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor. ==== Elimination ==== Duloxetine, administered in a single oral dose of 20 mg or 40 mg has plasma elimination half-life of 10–12 h and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state concentration is usually achieved after 3 days. Only trace amounts (<1%) of unchanged duloxetine are present in the urine and most of the dose (approx. 70%) appears in the urine as metabolites of duloxetine with about 20% excreted in the feces. Smoking is associated with a decrease in duloxetine concentration. == Research directions == Major depressive disorder is believed to be due in part to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines within the central nervous system. Antidepressants including ones with a similar mechanism of action as duloxetine, i.e., serotonin metabolism inhibition, cause a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine activity and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines; this mechanism may apply to duloxetine in its effect on depression but research on cytokines specific to duloxetine therapy is insufficient. Cytokines are immunoregulatory molecules that play a key role in the human immune response. Some cytokines are proinflammatory and contribute to the development of inflammation, while others are anti-inflammatory and help to control the proinflammatory response. Duloxetine can reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and may increase the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), however, mechanisms behind these effects are not well elucidated, there have been mixed findings regarding duloxetine's impact on cytokine production in different contexts, and the results are inconclusive. Duloxetine is being investigated for its potential to decrease opioid use in the perioperative period because duloxetine administration can help reduce opioid consumption and mitigate the risk of opioid-related side effects and dependence. In total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA), duloxetine is researched to provide pain relief; studies demonstrated that it can reduce pain for several weeks post-surgery without an increased risk of adverse drug events, suggesting that duloxetine could be a valuable component of a multimodal management regimen for patients undergoing THA or TKA. Also, duloxetine can reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting after THA or TKA, which are common side effects of anesthesia and opioids: this additional benefit could improve patient comfort and satisfaction, potentially enhancing recovery outcomes. == History == Duloxetine was created by Eli Lilly and Company researchers. David Robertson; David Wong, a co-inventor of fluoxetine; and Joseph Krushinski are listed as inventors on the patent application filed in 1986 and granted in 1990. The first publication on the invention of the racemic form of duloxetine known as LY227942, was made in 1988. The (+)-enantiomer, assigned LY248686, was chosen for further studies, because it inhibited serotonin reuptake in rat synaptosomes to twice the degree of the (–)-enantiomer. This molecule was subsequently named duloxetine. In 2001, Lilly filed a New Drug Application (NDA) for duloxetine with the US Food and Drug Administration. In 2003, however, the FDA ""recommended this application as not approvable from the manufacturing and control standpoint"" because of ""significant cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) violations at the finished product manufacturing facility"" of Eli Lilly in Indianapolis. Additionally, ""potential liver toxicity"" and QTc interval prolongation appeared as a concern. The FDA experts concluded that ""duloxetine can cause hepatotoxicity in the form of transaminase elevations. It may also be a factor in causing more severe liver injury, but there are no cases in the NDA database that clearly demonstrate this. Use of duloxetine in the presence of ethanol may potentiate the deleterious effect of ethanol on the liver."" The FDA also recommended ""routine blood pressure monitoring"", since there was a dose-dependent increase in elevated blood pressure readings, including at the new highest recommended dose of 120 mg ""where 24% of patients had one or more [elevated] blood pressure readings of 140/90 vs. 9% of placebo patients."" After the manufacturing issues were resolved, the liver toxicity warning included in the prescribing information, and the follow-up studies showed that duloxetine does not cause QTc interval prolongation, duloxetine was approved by the FDA for depression and diabetic neuropathy in 2004. In 2007, Health Canada approved duloxetine for the treatment of depression and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Duloxetine was approved for use of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in the EU in 2004. In 2005, Lilly withdrew the duloxetine application for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in the US, stating that discussions with the FDA indicated ""the agency is not prepared at this time to grant approval ... based on the data package submitted."" A year later Lilly abandoned the pursuit of this indication in the US market. The FDA approved duloxetine for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in February 2007. Cymbalta generated sales of nearly US$5 billion in 2012, with $4 billion of that in the US, but its patent protection terminated 1 January 2014. Lilly received a six-month extension beyond 30 June 2013, after testing for the treatment of depression in adolescents, which may produce US$1.5 billion in added sales. The first generic duloxetine was marketed by an Indian pharmaceutical company Dr. Reddy's Laboratories. == See also == List of antidepressants == Explanatory notes == == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -5.5122365e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
170	8-hydroxy mirtazapine	PUBMED	  To investigate the metabolism of mirtazapine (MIR) in Japanese psychiatric patients, we determined the plasma levels of MIR,   Seventy-nine Japanese psychiatric patients were treated with MIR for 1-8 weeks to achieve a steady-state concentration. Plasma levels of MIR, DMIR, and 8-OH-MIR were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma concentrations of MIR-G and 8-OH-MIR-G were determined by total MIR and total 8-OH-MIR (i. e., concentrations after hydrolysis) minus unconjugated MIR and unconjugated 8-OH-MIR, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction was used to determine CYP2D6 genotypes.  Plasma levels of 8-OH-MIR were lower than those of MIR and DMIR (median 1.42 nmol/L vs. 92.71 nmol/L and 44.96 nmol/L, respectively). The plasma levels (median) of MIR-G and 8-OH-MIR-G were 75.00 nmol/L and 111.60 nmol/L, giving MIR-G/MIR and 8-OH-MIR-G/8-OH-MIR ratios of 0.92 and 59.50, respectively. Multiple regression analysis revealed that smoking was correlated with the plasma MIR concentration (dose- and body weight-corrected, p=0.040) and that age (years) was significantly correlated with the plasma DMIR concentration (dose- and body weight-corrected, p=0.018). The steady-state plasma concentrations of MIR and its metabolites were unaffected by the number of CYP2D6*5 and CYP2D6*10 alleles.  The plasma concentration of 8-OH-MIR was as low as 1.42 nmol/L, whereas 8-OH-MIR-G had an approximate 59.50 times higher concentration than 8-OH-MIR, suggesting a significant role for hydroxylation of MIR and its glucuronidation in the Japanese population. A selective and reproducible off-line solid-phase microextraction procedure was developed for the simultaneous enantioselective determination of mirtazapine (MRT), demethylmirtazapine and 8-hydroxymirtazapine in human urine. CE was used for optimization of the extraction procedure whereas LC-MS was used for method validation and application. The influence of important factors in the solid-phase microextraction efficiency is discussed, such as the fiber coatings, extraction time, pH, ionic strength, temperature and desorption time. Before extraction, human urine samples were submitted to enzymatic hydrolysis at 37 degrees C for 16 h. Then, the enzyme was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and the pH was adjusted to 8 with 1 mol/L pH 11 phosphate buffer solution. In the extraction, the analytes were transferred from the aqueous solution to the polydimethylsiloxane-divinylbenzene fiber coating and then desorbed in methanol. The mean recoveries were 5.4, 1.7 and 1.0% for MRT, demethylmirtazapine and 8-hydroxymirtazapine enantiomers, respectively. The method was linear over the concentration range of 62-1250 ng/mL. The within-day and between-day assay precision and accuracy were lower than 15%. The method was successfully employed in a preliminary cumulative urinary excretion study after administration of racemic MRT to a healthy volunteer.

171	Imatinib	WIKIPEDIA	"Imatinib, sold under the brand names Gleevec and Glivec (both marketed worldwide by Novartis) among others, is an oral targeted therapy medication used to treat cancer. Imatinib is a small molecule inhibitor targeting multiple tyrosine kinases such as CSF1R, ABL, c-KIT, FLT3, and PDGFR-β. Specifically, it is used for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that are Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph+), certain types of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), systemic mastocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, and rash. Severe side effects may include fluid retention, gastrointestinal bleeding, bone marrow suppression, liver problems, and heart failure. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Imatinib works by stopping the Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase. This can slow growth or result in programmed cell death of certain types of cancer cells. Imatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. A generic version became available in the UK as of 2017. == Medical uses == Imatinib is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and a number of other malignancies. In 2006 the FDA expanded approved use to include dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD), and aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM). Imatinib is considered to be a very effective treatment for CML, and has been shown to improve outcomes for people with this type of leukemia. It can also be used to treat some types of ALL, but is not considered a standard of care for ALL. In many cases, Imatinib can induce a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) and many patients can have a long-term remission. It is also used to maintain remission in chronic phase CML patients. While Imatinib is a very effective treatment for CML and some types of ALL, it is not a cure for leukemia. Instead, it is a 'chronic therapy' that helps to control the disease and prevent it from progressing. Some patients may need to continue taking Imatinib for an extended period of time to maintain remission, and some patients may eventually require additional treatment options. === Chronic myelogenous leukemia === The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved imatinib as first-line treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, both in adults and children. The drug is approved in multiple contexts of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, including after stem cell transplant, in blast crisis, and newly diagnosed. Due in part to the development of imatinib and related drugs, the five-year survival rate for people with chronic myeloid leukemia increased from 31% in 1993, to 59% in 2009, to 70% in 2016. By 2023, the five year survival rate for people with chronic myeloid leukemia had risen to 90%. Starting from 2011, it became clear that CML patients who continue to respond to imatinib have the same or almost the same life expectancy as the general population. === Gastrointestinal stromal tumors === The FDA first granted approval for advanced GIST patients in 2002. On 1 February 2012, imatinib was approved for use after the surgical removal of KIT-positive tumors to help prevent recurrence. The drug is also approved in unresectable KIT-positive GISTs. === Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) === The FDA granted approval for the treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) patients in 2006. Specifically adult patients with unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Prior to approval DFSP was considered unresponsive to chemotherapy treatments. === Other === The FDA has approved imatinib for use in adults with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene rearrangements, aggressive systemic mastocytosis without or an unknown D816V c-KIT mutation, hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia who have the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase (CHIC2 allele deletion) or FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase negative or unknown, unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. On 25 January 2013, Gleevec was approved for use in children with Ph+ ALL. For treatment of progressive plexiform neurofibromas associated with neurofibromatosis type I, early research has shown potential for using the c-KIT tyrosine kinase blocking properties of imatinib. There have been several phase 2 trials of imatinib for aggressive fibromatosis. == Contraindications and cautions == The only known contraindication to imatinib is hypersensitivity to imatinib. Cautions include: Hepatic impairment Risk of severe CHF or left ventricular dysfunction, especially in patients with comorbidities Pregnancy, risk of embryo-fetal toxicity Risk of fluid retention Risk of growth stunting in children or adolescents == Side effects == The most common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, leg aches/cramps, fluid retention, visual disturbances, itchy rash, lowered resistance to infection, bruising or bleeding, loss of appetite, weight gain, reduced number of blood cells (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), and edema. === Cardiotoxicity === In some individuals, imatinib use was reported to be associated with left ventricular dysfunction which sometimes progressed to congestive cardiac failure despite an absence of prior heart disease. Clinical trials of imatinib did not report cardiac adverse effects, but had reported a notably high incidence of peripheral oedema, with some cases classified as severe. Patient biopsies as well as mice treated with large doses of imatinib exhibited cellular signs of cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxic effects appeared to mediated by inhibition of cytoplasmic ABL1 tyrosine kinase. === Childhood growth inhibition === Multiple human and animal studies suggest that if imatinib is used in prepubescent children, it may delay normal growth (more specifically bone elongation), although some may experience at least partial catch-up growth during puberty. The reason for this side effect is unclear; interference with a growth hormone (GH)-related pathway may be involved (prepubertal growth is GH-dependent, whereas pubertal growth is synergystically promoted by both GH and sex hormones). === Pigmentation changes === Imatinib use may cause lightening/depigmentation or darkening/repigmentation of hair (as is the case with some other tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and/or skin as well as hyperpigmentation of the gingiva. The median onset of hair color change is 4 weeks after initiation of therapy (but may occur over a year after initiation), is dose-dependent, and is reversible upon treatment discontinuation or dose reduction. C-kit receptors - one of the biological target of imatinib - are expressed by melanocytes. == Overdose == Medical experience with imatinib overdose is limited. Treatment is supportive. Imatinib is highly plasma protein-bound: dialysis is unlikely to be helpful removing imatinib. == Interactions == Its use is advised against in people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, ritonavir and nefazodone due to its reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates of any of these enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism. As with other immunosuppressants, application of live vaccines is contraindicated because the microorganisms in the vaccine could multiply and infect the patient. Inactivated and toxoid vaccines do not hold this risk, but may not be effective under imatinib therapy. Eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice are strongly discouraged as it increases the concentration of imatinib in the blood. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Imatinib is a 2-phenyl amino pyrimidine derivative that functions as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes. It occupies the TK active site, leading to a decrease in activity. There are a large number of TK enzymes in the body, including the insulin receptor. Imatinib is specific for the TK domain in abl (the Abelson proto-oncogene), c-kit and PDGF-R (platelet-derived growth factor receptor). In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the Philadelphia chromosome leads to a fusion protein of abl with bcr (breakpoint cluster region), termed bcr-abl. As this is now a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, imatinib is used to decrease bcr-abl activity. The active sites of tyrosine kinases each have a binding site for ATP. The enzymatic activity catalyzed by a tyrosine kinase is the transfer of the terminal phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on its substrates, a process known as protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Imatinib works by binding close to the ATP binding site of bcr-abl, locking it in a closed or self-inhibited conformation, and therefore inhibiting the enzyme activity of the protein semi-competitively. This fact explains why many BCR-ABL mutations can cause resistance to imatinib by shifting its equilibrium toward the open or active conformation. Imatinib is quite selective for bcr-abl, though it does also inhibit other targets mentioned above (c-kit and PDGF-R), as well as ABL2 (ARG) and DDR1 tyrosine kinases and NQO2 – an oxidoreductase. Imatinib also inhibits the abl protein of non-cancer cells, but these cells normally have additional redundant tyrosine kinases, which allows them to continue to function even if abl tyrosine kinase is inhibited. Some tumor cells, however, have a dependence on bcr-abl. Inhibition of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase also stimulates its entry in to the nucleus, where it is unable to perform any of its normal anti-apoptopic functions, leading to tumor cell death. ==== Other pathways affected ==== The Bcr-Abl pathway has many downstream pathways including the Ras/MapK pathway, which leads to increased proliferation due to increased growth factor-independent cell growth. It also affects the Src/Pax/Fak/Rac pathway. This affects the cytoskeleton, which leads to increased cell motility and decreased adhesion. The PI/PI3K/AKT/BCL-2 pathway is also affected. BCL-2 is responsible for keeping the mitochondria stable; this suppresses cell death by apoptosis and increases survival. The last pathway that Bcr-Abl affects is the JAK/STAT pathway, which is responsible for proliferation. === Pharmacokinetics === Imatinib is rapidly absorbed when given by mouth, and is highly bioavailable: 98% of an oral dose reaches the bloodstream. Metabolism of imatinib occurs in the liver and is mediated by several isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The main metabolite, N-demethylated piperazine derivative, is also active. The major route of elimination is in the bile and feces; only a small portion of the drug is excreted in the urine. Most of imatinib is eliminated as metabolites; only 25% is eliminated unchanged. The half-lives of imatinib and its main metabolite are 18 h and 40 h, respectively. It blocks the activity of Abelson cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (ABL), c-Kit and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). As an inhibitor of PDGFR, imatinib mesylate appears to have utility in the treatment of a variety of dermatological diseases. Imatinib has been reported to be an effective treatment for FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha+ mast cell disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === == History == Imatinib was invented in the late 1990s by scientists at Ciba-Geigy (which merged with Sandoz in 1996 to become Novartis), in a team led by the British biochemist Nicholas Lydon and that included Elisabeth Buchdunger and Jürg Zimmermann, and its use to treat CML was driven by oncologist Brian Druker of Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Other major contributions to imatinib development were made by biologist Anthony R. Hunter at Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, a physician, scientist, and hematologist at the University of Milano Bicocca, Italy, John Goldman at Hammersmith Hospital in London, and later on by Charles Sawyers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Imatinib was developed by rational drug design. After the Philadelphia chromosome mutation and hyperactive bcr-abl protein were discovered, the investigators screened chemical libraries to find a drug that would inhibit that protein. With high-throughput screening, they identified 2-phenylaminopyrimidine. This lead compound was then tested and modified by the introduction of methyl and benzamide groups to give it enhanced binding properties, resulting in imatinib. When Novartis tested imatinib in rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys in 1996, it was found to have several toxic effects; in particular, results indicating liver damage in dogs nearly stopped drug development completely. However, favorable results in studies with monkeys and in vitro human cells allowed testing to continue in humans. The first clinical trial of Gleevec took place in 1998, after Novartis reluctantly synthesized and released a few grams of the drug for Druker, enough for him to run a trial using a hundred or so patients. Mel Mann, who entered the clinical trial in August 1998, is the longest living person to be treated with the drug. The drug received FDA approval in May 2001, only two and a half years after the new drug application was submitted. On the same month it made the cover of TIME magazine as a ""bullet"" to be used against cancer. Druker, Lydon and Sawyers received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2009 for ""converting a fatal cancer into a manageable chronic condition"". During the FDA review, the tradename of the drug for the US market was changed from ""Glivec"" to ""Gleevec"" at the request of the FDA, to avoid confusion with Glyset, a diabetes drug. A Swiss patent application was filed on imatinib and various salts on in April 1992, which was then filed in the EU, the US, and other countries in March and April 1993. and in 1996 United States and European patent offices issued patents listing Jürg Zimmermann as the inventor. In July 1997, Novartis filed a new patent application in Switzerland on the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate (the mesylate salt of imatinib). The ""beta crystalline form"" of the molecule is a specific polymorph of imatinib mesylate; a specific way that the individual molecules pack together to form a solid. This is the actual form of the drug sold as Gleevec/Glivec; a salt (imatinib mesylate) as opposed to a free base, and the beta crystalline form as opposed to the alpha or other form.: 3 and 4 In 1998, Novartis filed international patent applications claiming priority to the 1997 filing. A United States patent was granted in 2005. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2013, more than 100 cancer specialists published a letter in Blood saying that the prices of many new cancer drugs, including imatinib, are so high that people in the United States could not afford them, and that the level of prices, and profits, was so high as to be immoral. Signatories of the letter included Brian Druker, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, and John Goldman, developers of imatinib. They wrote that in 2001, imatinib was priced at $30,000 (equivalent to $51,622 in 2023) a year, which was based on the price of interferon, then the standard treatment, and that at this price Novartis would have recouped its initial development costs in two years. They wrote that after unexpectedly becoming a blockbuster, Novartis increased the price to $92,000 (equivalent to $122,098 in 2023) per year in 2012, with annual revenues of $4.7 billion. Other physicians have complained about the cost. Druker, who led the clinical studies, never received any royalties or profits from the success of the drug. By 2016, the average wholesale price had increased to $120,000 (equivalent to $152,346 in 2023) a year, according to an analysis prepared for The Washington Post by Stacie Dusetzina of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. When competitive drugs came on the market, they were sold at a higher price to reflect the smaller population, and Novartis raised the price of Gleevec to match them. A 2012 economic analysis funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb estimated that the discovery and development of imatinib and related drugs had created $143 billion in societal value at a cost to consumers of approximately $14 billion. The $143 billion figure was based on an estimated 7.5 to 17.5 year survival advantage conferred by imatinib treatment, and included the value (discounted at 3% per annum) of ongoing benefits to society after the imatinib patent expiration. Prices for a 100 mg pill of Gleevec internationally range from $20 to $30, although generic imatinib is cheaper, as low as $2 per pill. === Controversies === ==== Patent litigation in India ==== Novartis fought a seven-year, controversial battle to patent Gleevec in India, and took the case all the way to the Indian Supreme Court. The patent application at the center of the case was filed by Novartis in India in 1998, after India had agreed to enter the World Trade Organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the TRIPS agreement. As part of this agreement, India made changes to its patent law, the biggest of which was that prior to these changes, patents on products were not allowed, while afterwards they were, albeit with restrictions. These changes came into effect in 2005, so Novartis' patent application waited in a ""mailbox"" with others until then, under procedures that India instituted to manage the transition. India also passed certain amendments to its patent law in 2005, just before the laws came into effect. The patent application claimed the final form of Gleevec (the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate).: 3 In 1993, during the time India did not allow patents on products, Novartis had patented imatinib, with salts vaguely specified, in many countries but could not patent it in India. The key differences between the two patent applications, were that 1998 patent application specified the counterion (Gleevec is a specific salt – imatinib mesylate) while the 1993 patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate, and the 1998 patent application specified the solid form of Gleevec – the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured (this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules) – while the 1993 patent application did not. The solid form of imatinib mesylate in Gleevec is beta crystalline. As provided under the TRIPS agreement, Novartis applied for Exclusive Marketing Rights (EMR) for Gleevec from the Indian Patent Office and the EMR was granted in November 2003. Novartis made use of the EMR to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched Gleevec in India. When examination of Novartis' patent application began in 2005, it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling Gleevec in India and by advocacy groups. The application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board. The key basis for the rejection was the part of Indian patent law that was created by amendment in 2005, describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs. That section, 3d, specified that such inventions are patentable only if ""they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy."" At one point, Novartis went to court to try to invalidate Section 3d; it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated TRIPS. Novartis lost that case and did not appeal. Novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to India's Supreme Court, which took the case. The Supreme Court case hinged on the interpretation of Section 3d. The Supreme Court issued its decision in 2013, ruling that the substance that Novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug (the raw form of imatinib, which was publicly disclosed in the 1993 patent application and in scientific articles), that Novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of Gleevec and the raw form of imatinib, and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts. == Research == One study demonstrated that imatinib mesylate was effective in patients with systemic mastocytosis, including those who had the D816V mutation in c-KIT. However, since imatinib binds to tyrosine kinases when they are in the inactive configuration and the D816V mutant of c-KIT is constitutively active, imatinib does not inhibit the kinase activity of the D816V mutant of c-KIT. Experience has shown, however, that imatinib is much less effective in patients with this mutation, and patients with the mutation comprise nearly 90% of cases of mastocytosis. Imatinib was initially thought to have a potential role in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. It was shown to reduce both the smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pulmonary vasculature in a variety of disease processes, including portopulmonary hypertension. However, a long-term trial of Imatinib in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension was unsuccessful, and serious and unexpected adverse events were frequent. These included 6 subdural hematomas and 17 deaths during or within 30 days of study end. In systemic sclerosis, the drug has been tested for potential use in slowing down pulmonary fibrosis. In laboratory settings, imatinib is being used as an experimental agent to suppress platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) by inhibiting its receptor (PDGF-Rβ). One of its effects is delaying atherosclerosis in mice without or with diabetes. Mouse animal studies have suggested that imatinib and related drugs may be useful in treating smallpox, should an outbreak ever occur. In vitro studies identified that a modified version of imatinib can bind to gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP). GSAP selectively increases the production and accumulation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid plaques, which suggests that molecules which target GSAP and are able to cross blood–brain barrier are potential therapeutic agents for treating Alzheimer's disease. Another study suggests that imatinib may not need to cross the blood–brain barrier to be effective at treating Alzheimer's, as the research indicates the production of beta-amyloid may begin in the liver. Tests on mice indicate that imatinib is effective at reducing beta-amyloid in the brain. It is not known whether reduction of beta-amyloid is a feasible way of treating Alzheimer's, as an anti-beta-amyloid vaccine has been shown to clear the brain of plaques without having any effect on Alzheimer symptoms. A formulation of imatinib with a cyclodextrin (Captisol) as a carrier to overcome the blood–brain barrier has shown reversal of opioid tolerance in a 2012 study in rats. Imatinib is an experimental drug in the treatment of desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis. == Etymology == The -tinib word stem makes reference to the drug's action as a tyrosine kinase (TYK) inhibitor. == References == == External links == ""Imatinib mesylate"".

172	Dextrorphan	WIKIPEDIA	Dextrorphan (DXO) is a psychoactive drug of the morphinan class which acts as an antitussive or cough suppressant and in high doses a dissociative hallucinogen. It is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of racemorphan; the levorotatory enantiomer is levorphanol. Dextrorphan is produced by O-demethylation of dextromethorphan by CYP2D6. Dextrorphan is an NMDA antagonist and contributes to the psychoactive effects of dextromethorphan. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The pharmacology of dextrorphan is similar to that of dextromethorphan (DXM). However, dextrorphan is much more potent as an NMDA receptor antagonist as well much less active as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but retains DXM's activity as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It also has more affinity for the opioid receptors than dextromethorphan, significantly so at high doses. === Pharmacokinetics === Dextrorphan has a notably longer elimination half-life than its parent compound, and therefore has a tendency to accumulate in the blood after repeated administration of normally dosed dextromethorphan formulations. It is further converted to 3-HM by CYP3A4 or glucuronidated. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Dextrorphan was formerly a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, but was unscheduled on October 1, 1976. == Research == Dextrorphan was under development for the treatment of stroke, and reached phase II clinical trials for this indication, but development was discontinued. == Environmental presence == In 2021, dextrorphan was identified in >75% of sludge samples taken from 12 wastewater treatment plants in California. The same study associated dextrorphan with estrogenic activity by using predictive modelling, before observing it in in vitro. == See also == Cough syrup Racemorphan; Levorphanol Noscapine Codeine; Pholcodine Dextromethorphan; Dimemorfan Butamirate Pentoxyverine Tipepidine Cloperastine Levocloperastine == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
174	Ondansetron	WIKIPEDIA	Ondansetron, sold under the brand name Zofran among others, is a medication used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, migraines, or surgery. It is also effective for treating gastroenteritis. It can be given orally (by mouth), intramuscularly (injection into a muscle), or intravenously (injection into a vein). Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation, headache, sleepiness, and itchiness. Serious side effects include QT prolongation and severe allergic reaction. It appears to be safe during pregnancy but has not been well studied in this group. It is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. It does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Ondansetron was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 61st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ondansetron is indicated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and postoperative nausea and vomiting. === Pregnancy === Ondansetron is used off-label to treat morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum of pregnancy. It is typically used after other antiemetic drugs have failed. A large multi-center cohort study found no association between ondansetron exposure and fetal risk compared to other antiemetics. === Cyclic vomiting syndrome === Ondansetron is one of several antiemetics used during the vomiting phase of cyclic vomiting syndrome. === Gastroenteritis === Trials in emergency department settings support the use of ondansetron to abort vomiting episodes associated with gastroenteritis and dehydration. A randomized controlled trial using a single dose of oral ondansetron in children with presumably viral gastroenteritis found it to be highly effective in stopping vomiting and increasing the effectiveness of oral rehydration therapy, thereby significantly increasing patient satisfaction. Only 16 of the 123 children treated with ondansetron vomited in the following 6 hours. A retrospective review found that ondansetron was used commonly for vomiting due to gastroenteritis, being administered in over 58% of cases. Its use reduced hospital admissions, but was also associated with higher rates of return visits to the emergency department. Furthermore, people who had initially received ondansetron were more likely to be admitted on the return visit than people who had not received the drug. However, this effect may simply be due to the agent being used more frequently in people who present with more severe illness. Its use was not found to mask serious diagnoses. === Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) === In a study of patients diagnosed as having IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), ondansetron showed statistically significant effects on stool consistency, frequency, urgency and bloating, but not on pain scores. This was confirmed in a later trial and meta-analysis and is included in international guidelines. == Special populations == === Children === Ondansetron has rarely been studied in people under 4 years of age. As such, little data is available to guide dosage recommendations. Three open non-comparative studies have been conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of ondansetron in children receiving a variety of chemotherapy regimens. Ondansetron was well tolerated and none of the patients experienced extrapyramidal symptoms. == Adverse effects == Headache is the most common adverse effect. A review of use for post-operative nausea and vomiting found that for every 36 people treated, one would experience headache, which could be severe. Constipation, diarrhea, and dizziness are other commonly reported side effects. It is broken down by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system and it has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system. === QT prolongation === Use of ondansetron has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to a potentially fatal heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Although this may happen in any person with any formulation, the risk is most salient with the injectable (intravenous) form of the drug and increases with dose. The risk is also higher in people taking other medicines that prolong the QT interval, as well as in people with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and/or bradyarrhythmias. As such, single doses of injectable ondansetron should not exceed 16 mg at one time. (Oral dosing recommendations remain intact, including the recommendation of a single 24 mg oral dose when indicated.) Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before the use of injectable ondansetron. People are cautioned to seek immediate medical care if symptoms such as irregular heartbeat/palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting occur while taking ondansetron. === Overdose === No specific treatment is available for ondansetron overdose; people are managed with supportive measures. An antidote to ondansetron is not known. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ondansetron is a highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity for dopamine receptors. The 5-HT3 receptors are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema in the medulla. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. It is thought that ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated mostly via antagonism of vagal afferents with a minor contribution from antagonism of central receptors. The R– and S–ondansetron isomers have similar potency as serotonin antagonists when tested on ex vivo rat vagus nerve. However, the R–ondansetron enantiomer was 7.9 times more potent as an antagonist of serotonin and 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (2-methylserotonin) when tested on the longitudinal smooth muscle from guinea pig ileum. However, the guinea pig ileum test was likely not as faithful as a test of 5-HT3 receptor antagonism, because ondansetron only partially blocked the effect of serotonin, while it completely blocked the effect of 2-methylserotonin. === Pharmacokinetics === Ondansetron may have a degree of peripheral selectivity due to binding to P-glycoprotein and efflux out of the brain at the blood–brain barrier. Ondansetron is marketed as a racemic mixture of R–(–)–ondansetron and S–(+)–ondansetron, and the two enantiomers have significantly different kinetics. In rats given 2 mg/kg intravenous doses of each enantiomer separately, R–(–)–ondansetron was found to have a 37% longer half-life (P < 0.05) and an 87% higher area-under-curve or AUC (P < 0.01) compared to S–(+)–ondansetron, indicating that the R enantiomer is metabolized more slowly. The chiral carbon in ondansetron is adjacent to a carbonyl group, so keto-enol tautomerism could theoretically lead to interconversion between the two enantiomers under physiologic conditions, if the hydrogen on the chiral carbon were removed and then replaced with opposite chirality. An experiment in rats given each enantiomer separately showed no evidence of this interconversion, the chirality was stable in vivo. A study of 141 human patients given 4 or 8 mg of intravenous ondansetron for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting also found that R and S–ondansetron have different pharmacokinetic properties. Each patient was classified according to their genotype for the liver enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A5, and they were put on a spectrum between poor metabolizers (slow) and ultra metabolizers (fast). CYP2D6 was found to be more important for the elimination of S–ondansetron, whereas CYP3A5 genotype had no impact on S–ondansetron plasma levels, measured 3 hours after drug administration. CYP3A5 was more important for R–ondansetron clearance, and CYP2D6 genotype had no consistent effect on plasma levels of R–ondansetron at 3 hours. == History == Ondansetron (marketed under the brand name Zofran) was developed in the mid-1980s by GlaxoSmithKline in London. It was granted U.S. patent protection in September 1987, received a use patent June 1988, and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 1991. It was granted another divisional patent in November 1996. Finally, owing to GlaxoSmithKline's research on pediatric use, ondansetron's patent protection was extended until December 2006. By this final year of its patent (2006), Zofran had become the 20th highest-selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales of US$1.3 billion in the first 9 months of 2006 (80% from the US). The first generic versions were approved by the U.S. FDA in December 2006, with marketing approval granted to Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and SICOR Pharmaceuticals. In December 2012, the FDA announced that the 32 mg, single intravenous (IV) dose of ondansetron was being withdrawn from U.S. market because of the potential for serious cardiac issues from prolonged QT interval. In 2018, University of São Paulo and Biolab were granted a patent for an orodispersible form of the drug. == Society and culture == === Publication bias === In 1997, ondansetron was the subject of a meta-analysis case study. Researchers examined 84 trials, with 11,980 people receiving ondansetron, published between 1991 and September 1996. Intravenous ondansetron 4 mg versus placebo was investigated in 16 reports and three further reports which had been duplicated a total of six times. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent vomiting within 24 hours was 9.5, with 95% confidence interval 6.9 to 15, in the 16 nonduplicated reports. In the three duplicated reports, the NNT was significantly lower at 3.9 (3.3 to 4.8). When all 25 reports were combined, the apparent NNT improved to 4.9 (4.4 to 5.6). Inclusion of duplicate reports led to a 23% overestimation of ondansetron's antiemetic efficacy. In addition, the authors found the covert duplication of reports on ondansetron was not easy to detect, because of lack of cross-referencing between papers, and reports containing duplicate findings were cited in eight reviews of the drug. Their analysis was a subject of an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1999. === Availability === Ondansetron is a generic medication and is available in many countries under many brand names. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
175	Caffeine	WIKIPEDIA	"Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class and is the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance globally. It is mainly used for its eugeroic (wakefulness promoting), ergogenic (physical performance-enhancing), or nootropic (cognitive-enhancing) properties. Caffeine acts by blocking binding of adenosine at a number of adenosine receptor types, inhibiting the centrally depressant effects of adenosine and enhancing the release of acetylcholine. Caffeine has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of adenosine, which allows it to bind and block its receptors. Caffeine also increases cyclic AMP levels through nonselective inhibition of phosphodiesterase, increases calcium release from intracellular stores, and antagonizes GABA receptors, although these mechanisms typically occur at concentrations beyond usual human consumption. Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline purine, a methylxanthine alkaloid, and is chemically related to the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). It is found in the seeds, fruits, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to Africa, East Asia and South America and helps to protect them against herbivores and from competition by preventing the germination of nearby seeds, as well as encouraging consumption by select animals such as honey bees. The best-known source of caffeine is the coffee bean, the seed of the Coffea plant. People may drink beverages containing caffeine to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve cognitive performance. To make these drinks, caffeine is extracted by steeping the plant product in water, a process called infusion. Caffeine-containing drinks, such as coffee, tea, and cola, are consumed globally in high volumes. In 2020, almost 10 million tonnes of coffee beans were consumed globally. Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike most other psychoactive substances, caffeine remains largely unregulated and legal in nearly all parts of the world. Caffeine is also an outlier as its use is seen as socially acceptable in most cultures with it even being encouraged. Caffeine has both positive and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent the premature infant breathing disorders bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Some people experience sleep disruption or anxiety if they consume caffeine, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal; some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit caffeine to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less. Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence – associated with withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness, headache, and irritability – when an individual stops using caffeine after repeated daily intake. Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use (i.e., these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use). Caffeine is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as generally recognized as safe. Toxic doses, over 10 grams per day for an adult, are much higher than the typical dose of under 500 milligrams per day. The European Food Safety Authority reported that up to 400 mg of caffeine per day (around 5.7 mg/kg of body mass per day) does not raise safety concerns for non-pregnant adults, while intakes up to 200 mg per day for pregnant and lactating women do not raise safety concerns for the fetus or the breast-fed infants. A cup of coffee contains 80–175 mg of caffeine, depending on what ""bean"" (seed) is used, how it is roasted, and how it is prepared (e.g., drip, percolation, or espresso). Thus it requires roughly 50–100 ordinary cups of coffee to reach the toxic dose. However, pure powdered caffeine, which is available as a dietary supplement, can be lethal in tablespoon-sized amounts. == Uses == === Medical === Caffeine is used for both prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. It may improve weight gain during therapy and reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy as well as reduce language and cognitive delay. On the other hand, subtle long-term side effects are possible. Caffeine is used as a primary treatment for apnea of prematurity, but not prevention. It is also used for orthostatic hypotension treatment. Some people use caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee or tea to try to treat their asthma. Evidence to support this practice is poor. It appears that caffeine in low doses improves airway function in people with asthma, increasing forced expiratory volume (FEV1) by 5% to 18% for up to four hours. The addition of caffeine (100–130 mg) to commonly prescribed pain relievers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen modestly improves the proportion of people who achieve pain relief. Consumption of caffeine after abdominal surgery shortens the time to recovery of normal bowel function and shortens length of hospital stay. Caffeine was formerly used as a second-line treatment for ADHD. It is considered less effective than methylphenidate or amphetamine but more so than placebo for children with ADHD. Children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD are more likely to consume caffeine, perhaps as a form of self-medication. === Enhancing performance === ==== Cognitive performance ==== Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that may reduce fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, wakefulness, concentration, and motor coordination. The amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance. The desired effects arise approximately one hour after consumption, and the desired effects of a moderate dose usually subside after about three or four hours. Caffeine can delay or prevent sleep and improves task performance during sleep deprivation. Shift workers who use caffeine make fewer mistakes that could result from drowsiness. Caffeine in a dose dependent manner increases alertness in both fatigued and normal individuals. A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2014 found that concurrent caffeine and L-theanine use has synergistic psychoactive effects that promote alertness, attention, and task switching; these effects are most pronounced during the first hour post-dose. ==== Physical performance ==== Caffeine is a proven ergogenic aid in humans. Caffeine improves athletic performance in aerobic (especially endurance sports) and anaerobic conditions. Moderate doses of caffeine (around 5 mg/kg) can improve sprint performance, cycling and running time trial performance, endurance (i.e., it delays the onset of muscle fatigue and central fatigue), and cycling power output. Caffeine increases basal metabolic rate in adults. Caffeine ingestion prior to aerobic exercise increases fat oxidation, particularly in persons with low physical fitness. Caffeine improves muscular strength and power, and may enhance muscular endurance. Caffeine also enhances performance on anaerobic tests. Caffeine consumption before constant load exercise is associated with reduced perceived exertion. While this effect is not present during exercise-to-exhaustion exercise, performance is significantly enhanced. This is congruent with caffeine reducing perceived exertion, because exercise-to-exhaustion should end at the same point of fatigue. Caffeine also improves power output and reduces time to completion in aerobic time trials, an effect positively (but not exclusively) associated with longer duration exercise. === Specific populations === ==== Adults ==== For the general population of healthy adults, Health Canada advises a daily intake of no more than 400 mg. This limit was found to be safe by a 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology. ==== Children ==== In healthy children, moderate caffeine intake under 400 mg produces effects that are ""modest and typically innocuous"". As early as six months old, infants can metabolize caffeine at the same rate as that of adults. Higher doses of caffeine (>400 mg) can cause physiological, psychological and behavioral harm, particularly for children with psychiatric or cardiac conditions. There is no evidence that coffee stunts a child's growth. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that caffeine consumption, particularly in the case of energy and sports drinks, is not appropriate for children and adolescents and should be avoided. This recommendation is based on a clinical report released by American Academy of Pediatrics in 2011 with a review of 45 publications from 1994 to 2011 and includes inputs from various stakeholders (Pediatricians, Committee on nutrition, Canadian Pediatric Society, Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Sports Medicine & Fitness committee, National Federations of High School Associations). For children age 12 and under, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 2.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Based on average body weights of children, this translates to the following age-based intake limits: ==== Adolescents ==== Health Canada has not developed advice for adolescents because of insufficient data. However, they suggest that daily caffeine intake for this age group be no more than 2.5 mg/kg body weight. This is because the maximum adult caffeine dose may not be appropriate for light-weight adolescents or for younger adolescents who are still growing. The daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight would not cause adverse health effects in the majority of adolescent caffeine consumers. This is a conservative suggestion since older and heavier-weight adolescents may be able to consume adult doses of caffeine without experiencing adverse effects. ==== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ==== The metabolism of caffeine is reduced in pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, and the half-life of caffeine during pregnancy can be increased up to 15 hours (as compared to 2.5 to 4.5 hours in non-pregnant adults). Evidence regarding the effects of caffeine on pregnancy and for breastfeeding are inconclusive. There is limited primary and secondary advice for, or against, caffeine use during pregnancy and its effects on the fetus or newborn. The UK Food Standards Agency has recommended that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake, out of prudence, to less than 200 mg of caffeine a day – the equivalent of two cups of instant coffee, or one and a half to two cups of fresh coffee. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200 mg per day in pregnant women. For women who breastfeed, are pregnant, or may become pregnant, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300 mg, or a little over two 8 oz (237 mL) cups of coffee. A 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology found evidence supporting that caffeine consumption up to 300 mg/day for pregnant women is generally not associated with adverse reproductive or developmental effect. There are conflicting reports in the scientific literature about caffeine use during pregnancy. A 2011 review found that caffeine during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations, miscarriage or growth retardation even when consumed in moderate to high amounts. Other reviews, however, concluded that there is some evidence that higher caffeine intake by pregnant women may be associated with a higher risk of giving birth to a low birth weight baby, and may be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss. A systematic review, analyzing the results of observational studies, suggests that women who consume large amounts of caffeine (greater than 300 mg/day) prior to becoming pregnant may have a higher risk of experiencing pregnancy loss. == Adverse effects == === Physiological === Caffeine in coffee and other caffeinated drinks can affect gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion. In postmenopausal women, high caffeine consumption can accelerate bone loss. Caffeine, alongside other factors such as stress and fatigue, can also increase the pressure in various muscles, including the eyelids. Acute ingestion of caffeine in large doses (at least 250–300 mg, equivalent to the amount found in 2–3 cups of coffee or 5–8 cups of tea) results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived of caffeine for a period of days or weeks. This increase is due to both a diuresis (increase in water excretion) and a natriuresis (increase in saline excretion); it is mediated via proximal tubular adenosine receptor blockade. The acute increase in urinary output may increase the risk of dehydration. However, chronic users of caffeine develop a tolerance to this effect and experience no increase in urinary output. === Psychological === Minor undesired symptoms from caffeine ingestion not sufficiently severe to warrant a psychiatric diagnosis are common and include mild anxiety, jitteriness, insomnia, increased sleep latency, and reduced coordination. Caffeine can have negative effects on anxiety disorders. According to a 2011 literature review, caffeine use may induce anxiety and panic disorders in people with Parkinson's disease. At high doses, typically greater than 300 mg, caffeine can both cause and worsen anxiety. For some people, discontinuing caffeine use can significantly reduce anxiety. In moderate doses, caffeine has been associated with reduced symptoms of depression and lower suicide risk. Two reviews indicate that increased consumption of coffee and caffeine may reduce the risk of depression. Some textbooks state that caffeine is a mild euphoriant, while others state that it is not a euphoriant. Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder is a subclass of the DSM-5 diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. === Reinforcement disorders === ==== Addiction ==== Whether caffeine can result in an addictive disorder depends on how addiction is defined. Compulsive caffeine consumption under any circumstances has not been observed, and caffeine is therefore not generally considered addictive. However, some diagnostic models, such as the ICDM-9 and ICD-10, include a classification of caffeine addiction under a broader diagnostic model. Some state that certain users can become addicted and therefore unable to decrease use even though they know there are negative health effects. Caffeine does not appear to be a reinforcing stimulus, and some degree of aversion may actually occur, with people preferring placebo over caffeine in a study on drug abuse liability published in an NIDA research monograph. Some state that research does not provide support for an underlying biochemical mechanism for caffeine addiction. Other research states it can affect the reward system. ""Caffeine addiction"" was added to the ICDM-9 and ICD-10. However, its addition was contested with claims that this diagnostic model of caffeine addiction is not supported by evidence. The American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 does not include the diagnosis of a caffeine addiction but proposes criteria for the disorder for more study. ==== Dependence and withdrawal ==== Withdrawal can cause mild to clinically significant distress or impairment in daily functioning. The frequency at which this occurs is self-reported at 11%, but in lab tests only half of the people who report withdrawal actually experience it, casting doubt on many claims of dependence. and most cases of caffeine withdrawal were 13% in the moderate sense. Moderately physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms may occur upon abstinence, with greater than 100 mg caffeine per day, although these symptoms last no longer than a day. Some symptoms associated with psychological dependence may also occur during withdrawal. The diagnostic criteria for caffeine withdrawal require a previous prolonged daily use of caffeine. Following 24 hours of a marked reduction in consumption, a minimum of 3 of these signs or symptoms is required to meet withdrawal criteria: difficulty concentrating, depressed mood/irritability, flu-like symptoms, headache, and fatigue. Additionally, the signs and symptoms must disrupt important areas of functioning and are not associated with effects of another condition. The ICD-11 includes caffeine dependence as a distinct diagnostic category, which closely mirrors the DSM-5's proposed set of criteria for ""caffeine-use disorder"". Caffeine use disorder refers to dependence on caffeine characterized by failure to control caffeine consumption despite negative physiological consequences. The APA, which published the DSM-5, acknowledged that there was sufficient evidence in order to create a diagnostic model of caffeine dependence for the DSM-5, but they noted that the clinical significance of the disorder is unclear. Due to this inconclusive evidence on clinical significance, the DSM-5 classifies caffeine-use disorder as a ""condition for further study"". Tolerance to the effects of caffeine occurs for caffeine-induced elevations in blood pressure and the subjective feelings of nervousness. Sensitization, the process whereby effects become more prominent with use, may occur for positive effects such as feelings of alertness and wellbeing. Tolerance varies for daily, regular caffeine users and high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200 mg/day spread throughout the day) have been shown to produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100 mg/day, such as a 6 oz (170 g) cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz (340 g) servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular caffeine users have the least caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not. === Risk of other diseases === A neuroprotective effect of caffeine against Alzheimer's disease and dementia is possible but the evidence is inconclusive. Caffeine may lessen the severity of acute mountain sickness if taken a few hours prior to attaining a high altitude. One meta analysis has found that caffeine consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Regular caffeine consumption may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and may slow the progression of Parkinson's disease. Caffeine increases intraocular pressure in those with glaucoma but does not appear to affect normal individuals. The DSM-5 also includes other caffeine-induced disorders consisting of caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, caffeine-induced sleep disorder and unspecified caffeine-related disorders. The first two disorders are classified under ""Anxiety Disorder"" and ""Sleep-Wake Disorder"" because they share similar characteristics. Other disorders that present with significant distress and impairment of daily functioning that warrant clinical attention but do not meet the criteria to be diagnosed under any specific disorders are listed under ""Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorders"". === Energy crash === Caffeine is reputed to cause a fall in energy several hours after drinking, but this is not well researched. == Overdose == Consumption of 1–1.5 grams (1,000–1,500 mg) per day is associated with a condition known as caffeinism. Caffeinism usually combines caffeine dependency with a wide range of unpleasant symptoms including nervousness, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and palpitations after caffeine use. Caffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system overstimulation known as caffeine intoxication, a clinically significant temporary condition that develops during, or shortly after, the consumption of caffeine. This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400–500 mg at a time). According to the DSM-5, caffeine intoxication may be diagnosed if five (or more) of the following symptoms develop after recent consumption of caffeine: restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, diuresis, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, rambling flow of thought and speech, tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia, periods of inexhaustibility, and psychomotor agitation. According to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), cases of very high caffeine intake (e.g. > 5 g) may result in caffeine intoxication with symptoms including mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations or psychosis, and rhabdomyolysis. === Energy drinks === High caffeine consumption in energy drinks (at least one liter or 320 mg of caffeine) was associated with short-term cardiovascular side effects including hypertension, prolonged QT interval, and heart palpitations. These cardiovascular side effects were not seen with smaller amounts of caffeine consumption in energy drinks (less than 200 mg). === Severe intoxication === As of 2007 there is no known antidote or reversal agent for caffeine intoxication. Treatment of mild caffeine intoxication is directed toward symptom relief; severe intoxication may require peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or hemofiltration. Intralipid infusion therapy is indicated in cases of imminent risk of cardiac arrest in order to scavenge the free serum caffeine. === Lethal dose === Death from caffeine ingestion appears to be rare, and most commonly caused by an intentional overdose of medications. In 2016, 3702 caffeine-related exposures were reported to Poison Control Centers in the United States, of which 846 required treatment at a medical facility, and 16 had a major outcome; and several caffeine-related deaths are reported in case studies. The LD50 of caffeine in rats is 192 milligrams per kilogram of body mass. The fatal dose in humans is estimated to be 150–200 milligrams per kilogram, which is 10.5–14 grams for a typical 70 kg (150 lb) adult, equivalent to about 75–100 cups of coffee. There are cases where doses as low as 57 milligrams per kilogram have been fatal. A number of fatalities have been caused by overdoses of readily available powdered caffeine supplements, for which the estimated lethal amount is less than a tablespoon. The lethal dose is lower in individuals whose ability to metabolize caffeine is impaired due to genetics or chronic liver disease. A death was reported in 2013 of a man with liver cirrhosis who overdosed on caffeinated mints. == Interactions == Caffeine is a substrate for CYP1A2, and interacts with many substances through this and other mechanisms. === Alcohol === According to DSST, alcohol causes a decrease in performance on their standardized tests, and caffeine causes a significant improvement. When alcohol and caffeine are consumed jointly, the effects of the caffeine are changed, but the alcohol effects remain the same. For example, consuming additional caffeine does not reduce the effect of alcohol. However, the jitteriness and alertness given by caffeine is decreased when additional alcohol is consumed. Alcohol consumption alone reduces both inhibitory and activational aspects of behavioral control. Caffeine antagonizes the effect of alcohol on the activational aspect of behavioral control, but has no effect on the inhibitory behavioral control. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend avoidance of concomitant consumption of alcohol and caffeine, as taking them together may lead to increased alcohol consumption, with a higher risk of alcohol-associated injury. === Smoking === Smoking tobacco has been shown to increase caffeine clearance by 56% as a result of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons inducing the CYP1A2 enzyme. The CYP1A2 enzyme that is induced by smoking is responsible for the metabolism of caffeine; increased enzyme activity leads to increased caffeine clearance, and is associated with greater coffee consumption for regular smokers. === Birth control === Birth control pills can extend the half-life of caffeine by as much as 40%, requiring greater attention to caffeine consumption. === Medications === Caffeine sometimes increases the effectiveness of some medications, such as those for headaches. Caffeine was determined to increase the potency of some over-the-counter analgesic medications by 40%. The pharmacological effects of adenosine may be blunted in individuals taking large quantities of methylxanthines like caffeine. Some other examples of methylxanthines include the medications theophylline and aminophylline, which are prescribed to relieve symptoms of asthma or COPD. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === In the absence of caffeine and when a person is awake and alert, little adenosine is present in CNS neurons. With a continued wakeful state, over time adenosine accumulates in the neuronal synapse, in turn binding to and activating adenosine receptors found on certain CNS neurons; when activated, these receptors produce a cellular response that ultimately increases drowsiness. When caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness. ==== Receptor and ion channel targets ==== Caffeine is an antagonist of adenosine A2A receptors, and knockout mouse studies have specifically implicated antagonism of the A2A receptor as responsible for the wakefulness-promoting effects of caffeine. Antagonism of A2A receptors in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) reduces inhibitory GABA neurotransmission to the tuberomammillary nucleus, a histaminergic projection nucleus that activation-dependently promotes arousal. This disinhibition of the tuberomammillary nucleus is the downstream mechanism by which caffeine produces wakefulness-promoting effects. Caffeine is an antagonist of all four adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), although with varying potencies. The affinity (KD) values of caffeine for the human adenosine receptors are 12 μM at A1, 2.4 μM at A2A, 13 μM at A2B, and 80 μM at A3. Antagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine also stimulates the medullary vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, which increases respiratory rate, reduces heart rate, and constricts blood vessels. Adenosine receptor antagonism also promotes neurotransmitter release (e.g., monoamines and acetylcholine), which endows caffeine with its stimulant effects; adenosine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. Heart palpitations are caused by blockade of the A1 receptor. Because caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily crosses the blood–brain barrier that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors (in other words, an agent that reduces the effects of adenosine). The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a competitive antagonist. In addition to its activity at adenosine receptors, caffeine is an inositol trisphosphate receptor 1 antagonist and a voltage-independent activator of the ryanodine receptors (RYR1, RYR2, and RYR3). It is also a competitive antagonist of the ionotropic glycine receptor. ==== Effects on striatal dopamine ==== While caffeine does not directly bind to any dopamine receptors, it influences the binding activity of dopamine at its receptors in the striatum by binding to adenosine receptors that have formed GPCR heteromers with dopamine receptors, specifically the A1–D1 receptor heterodimer (this is a receptor complex with one adenosine A1 receptor and one dopamine D1 receptor) and the A2A–D2 receptor heterotetramer (this is a receptor complex with two adenosine A2A receptors and two dopamine D2 receptors). The A2A–D2 receptor heterotetramer has been identified as a primary pharmacological target of caffeine, primarily because it mediates some of its psychostimulant effects and its pharmacodynamic interactions with dopaminergic psychostimulants. Caffeine also causes the release of dopamine in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens core (a substructure within the ventral striatum), but not the nucleus accumbens shell, by antagonizing A1 receptors in the axon terminal of dopamine neurons and A1–A2A heterodimers (a receptor complex composed of one adenosine A1 receptor and one adenosine A2A receptor) in the axon terminal of glutamate neurons. During chronic caffeine use, caffeine-induced dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens core is markedly reduced due to drug tolerance. ==== Enzyme targets ==== Caffeine, like other xanthines, also acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. As a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caffeine raises intracellular cyclic AMP, activates protein kinase A, inhibits TNF-alpha and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. Caffeine also affects the cholinergic system where it is a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. === Pharmacokinetics === Caffeine from coffee or other beverages is absorbed by the small intestine within 45 minutes of ingestion and distributed throughout all bodily tissues. Peak blood concentration is reached within 1–2 hours. It is eliminated by first-order kinetics. Caffeine can also be absorbed rectally, evidenced by suppositories of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine (for the relief of migraine) and of chlorobutanol and caffeine (for the treatment of hyperemesis). However, rectal absorption is less efficient than oral: the maximum concentration (Cmax) and total amount absorbed (AUC) are both about 30% (i.e., 1/3.5) of the oral amounts. Caffeine's biological half-life – the time required for the body to eliminate one-half of a dose – varies widely among individuals according to factors such as pregnancy, other drugs, liver enzyme function level (needed for caffeine metabolism) and age. In healthy adults, caffeine's half-life is between 3 and 7 hours. The half-life is decreased by 30-50% in adult male smokers, approximately doubled in women taking oral contraceptives, and prolonged in the last trimester of pregnancy. In newborns the half-life can be 80 hours or more, dropping rapidly with age, possibly to less than the adult value by age 6 months. The antidepressant fluvoxamine (Luvox) reduces the clearance of caffeine by more than 90%, and increases its elimination half-life more than tenfold, from 4.9 hours to 56 hours. Caffeine is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzyme system (particularly by the CYP1A2 isozyme) into three dimethylxanthines, each of which has its own effects on the body: Paraxanthine (84%): Increases lipolysis, leading to elevated glycerol and free fatty acid levels in blood plasma. Theobromine (12%): Dilates blood vessels and increases urine volume. Theobromine is also the principal alkaloid in the cocoa bean (chocolate). Theophylline (4%): Relaxes smooth muscles of the bronchi, and is used to treat asthma. The therapeutic dose of theophylline, however, is many times greater than the levels attained from caffeine metabolism. 1,3,7-Trimethyluric acid is a minor caffeine metabolite. 7-Methylxanthine is also a metabolite of caffeine. Each of the above metabolites is further metabolized and then excreted in the urine. Caffeine can accumulate in individuals with severe liver disease, increasing its half-life. A 2011 review found that increased caffeine intake was associated with a variation in two genes that increase the rate of caffeine catabolism. Subjects who had this mutation on both chromosomes consumed 40 mg more caffeine per day than others. This is presumably due to the need for a higher intake to achieve a comparable desired effect, not that the gene led to a disposition for greater incentive of habituation. == Chemistry == Pure anhydrous caffeine is a bitter-tasting, white, odorless powder with a melting point of 235–238 °C. Caffeine is moderately soluble in water at room temperature (2 g/100 mL), but quickly soluble in boiling water (66 g/100 mL). It is also moderately soluble in ethanol (1.5 g/100 mL). It is weakly basic (pKa of conjugate acid = ~0.6) requiring strong acid to protonate it. Caffeine does not contain any stereogenic centers and hence is classified as an achiral molecule. The xanthine core of caffeine contains two fused rings, a pyrimidinedione and imidazole. The pyrimidinedione in turn contains two amide functional groups that exist predominantly in a zwitterionic resonance the location from which the nitrogen atoms are double bonded to their adjacent amide carbons atoms. Hence all six of the atoms within the pyrimidinedione ring system are sp2 hybridized and planar. The imidazole ring also has a resonance. Therefore, the fused 5,6 ring core of caffeine contains a total of ten pi electrons and hence according to Hückel's rule is aromatic. === Synthesis === The biosynthesis of caffeine is an example of convergent evolution among different species. Caffeine may be synthesized in the lab starting with 1,3-dimethylurea and malonic acid. Production of synthesized caffeine largely takes place in pharmaceutical plants in China. Synthetic and natural caffeine are chemically identical and nearly indistinguishable. The primary distinction is that synthetic caffeine is manufactured from urea and chloroacetic acid, while natural caffeine is extracted from plant sources, a process known as decaffeination. Despite the different production methods, the final product and its effects on the body are similar. Research on synthetic caffeine supports that it has the same stimulating effects on the body as natural caffeine. And although many claim that natural caffeine is absorbed slower and therefore leads to a gentler caffeine crash, there is little scientific evidence supporting the notion. === Decaffeination === Germany, the birthplace of decaffeinated coffee, is home to several decaffeination plants, including the world's largest, Coffein Compagnie. Over half of the decaf coffee sold in the U.S. first travels from the tropics to Germany for caffeine removal before making its way to American consumers. Extraction of caffeine from coffee, to produce caffeine and decaffeinated coffee, can be performed using a number of solvents. Following are main methods: Water extraction: Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains many other compounds in addition to caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through activated charcoal, which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter caffeine tablets. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction: Supercritical carbon dioxide is an excellent nonpolar solvent for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: CO2 is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1 °C and pressures above 73 atm. Under these conditions, CO2 is in a ""supercritical"" state: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden CO2 is then sprayed with high-pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by charcoal adsorption (as above) or by distillation, recrystallization, or reverse osmosis. Extraction by organic solvents: Certain organic solvents such as ethyl acetate present much less health and environmental hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used formerly. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds. ""Decaffeinated"" coffees do in fact contain caffeine in many cases – some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable levels. One study found that decaffeinated coffee contained 10 mg of caffeine per cup, compared to approximately 85 mg of caffeine per cup for regular coffee. === Detection in body fluids === Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2–10 mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36 mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15 mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse. === Analogs === Some analog substances have been created which mimic caffeine's properties with either function or structure or both. Of the latter group are the xanthines DMPX and 8-chlorotheophylline, which is an ingredient in dramamine. Members of a class of nitrogen substituted xanthines are often proposed as potential alternatives to caffeine. Many other xanthine analogues constituting the adenosine receptor antagonist class have also been elucidated. Some other caffeine analogs: Dipropylcyclopentylxanthine 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine 8-Phenyltheophylline === Precipitation of tannins === Caffeine, as do other alkaloids such as cinchonine, quinine or strychnine, precipitates polyphenols and tannins. This property can be used in a quantitation method. == Natural occurrence == Around thirty plant species are known to contain caffeine. Common sources are the ""beans"" (seeds) of the two cultivated coffee plants, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora (the quantity varies, but 1.3% is a typical value); and of the cocoa plant, Theobroma cacao; the leaves of the tea plant; and kola nuts. Other sources include the leaves of yaupon holly, South American holly yerba mate, and Amazonian holly guayusa; and seeds from Amazonian maple guarana berries. Temperate climates around the world have produced unrelated caffeine-containing plants. Caffeine in plants acts as a natural pesticide: it can paralyze and kill predator insects feeding on the plant. High caffeine levels are found in coffee seedlings when they are developing foliage and lack mechanical protection. In addition, high caffeine levels are found in the surrounding soil of coffee seedlings, which inhibits seed germination of nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving seedlings with the highest caffeine levels fewer competitors for existing resources for survival. Caffeine is stored in tea leaves in two places. Firstly, in the cell vacuoles where it is complexed with polyphenols. This caffeine probably is released into the mouth parts of insects, to discourage herbivory. Secondly, around the vascular bundles, where it probably inhibits pathogenic fungi from entering and colonizing the vascular bundles. Caffeine in nectar may improve the reproductive success of the pollen producing plants by enhancing the reward memory of pollinators such as honey bees. The differing perceptions in the effects of ingesting beverages made from various plants containing caffeine could be explained by the fact that these beverages also contain varying mixtures of other methylxanthine alkaloids, including the cardiac stimulants theophylline and theobromine, and polyphenols that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine. == Products == Products containing caffeine include coffee, tea, soft drinks (""colas""), energy drinks, other beverages, chocolate, caffeine tablets, other oral products, and inhalation products. According to a 2020 study in the United States, coffee is the major source of caffeine intake in middle-aged adults, while soft drinks and tea are the major sources in adolescents. Energy drinks are more commonly consumed as a source of caffeine in adolescents as compared to adults. === Beverages === ==== Coffee ==== The world's primary source of caffeine is the coffee ""bean"" (the seed of the coffee plant), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of coffee bean and the method of preparation used; even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety espresso, to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of drip coffee. Arabica coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the robusta variety. In general, dark-roast coffee has slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces caffeine content of the bean by a small amount. ==== Tea ==== Tea contains more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since less of the product is used as compared to an equivalent serving of coffee. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, teas contain varying amounts of caffeine. Tea contains small amounts of theobromine and slightly higher levels of theophylline than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese green tea, gyokuro, for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like lapsang souchong, which has minimal content. ==== Soft drinks and energy drinks ==== Caffeine is also a common ingredient of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce (350 mL) serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient. ==== Other beverages ==== Maté is a drink popular in many parts of South America. Its preparation consists of filling a gourd with the leaves of the South American holly yerba mate, pouring hot but not boiling water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves. Guaraná is a soft drink originating in Brazil made from the seeds of the Guaraná fruit. The leaves of Ilex guayusa, the Ecuadorian holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a guayusa tea. The leaves of Ilex vomitoria, the yaupon holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a yaupon tea. Commercially prepared coffee-flavoured milk beverages are popular in Australia. Examples include Oak's Ice Coffee and Farmers Union Iced Coffee. The amount of caffeine in these beverages can vary widely. Caffeine concentrations can differ significantly from the manufacturer's claims. === Cacao solids === Cocoa solids (derived from cocoa bean) contain 230 mg caffeine per 100 g. The caffeine content varies between cocoa bean strains. Caffeine content mg/g (sorted by lowest caffeine content): Forastero (defatted): 1.3 mg/g Nacional (defatted): 2.4 mg/g Trinitario (defatted): 6.3/g Criollo (defatted): 11.3 mg/g ==== Chocolate ==== Caffeine per 100 g: Dark chocolate, 70-85% cacao solids: 80 mg Dark chocolate, 60-69% cacao solids: 86 mg Dark chocolate, 45- 59% cacao solids: 43 mg Milk chocolate: 20 mg The stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine. === Tablets === Tablets offer several advantages over coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages, including convenience, known dosage, and avoidance of concomitant intake of sugar, acids, and fluids. A use of caffeine in this form is said to improve mental alertness. These tablets are commonly used by students studying for their exams and by people who work or drive for long hours. === Other oral products === One U.S. company is marketing oral dissolvable caffeine strips. Another intake route is SpazzStick, a caffeinated lip balm. Alert Energy Caffeine Gum was introduced in the United States in 2013, but was voluntarily withdrawn after an announcement of an investigation by the FDA of the health effects of added caffeine in foods. === Inhalants === Similar to an e-cigarette, a caffeine inhaler may be used to deliver caffeine or a stimulant like guarana by vaping. In 2012, the FDA sent a warning letter to one of the companies marketing an inhaler, expressing concerns for the lack of safety information available about inhaled caffeine. === Combinations with other drugs === Some beverages combine alcohol with caffeine to create a caffeinated alcoholic drink. The stimulant effects of caffeine may mask the depressant effects of alcohol, potentially reducing the user's awareness of their level of intoxication. Such beverages have been the subject of bans due to safety concerns. In particular, the United States Food and Drug Administration has classified caffeine added to malt liquor beverages as an ""unsafe food additive"". Ya ba contains a combination of methamphetamine and caffeine. Painkillers such as propyphenazone/paracetamol/caffeine combine caffeine with an analgesic. == History == === Discovery and spread of use === According to Chinese legend, the Chinese emperor Shennong, reputed to have reigned in about 3000 BCE, inadvertently discovered tea when he noted that when certain leaves fell into boiling water, a fragrant and restorative drink resulted. Shennong is also mentioned in Lu Yu's Cha Jing, a famous early work on the subject of tea. The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee plant appears in the middle of the fifteenth century, in the Sufi monasteries of the Yemen in southern Arabia. From Mocha, coffee spread to Egypt and North Africa, and by the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia and Turkey. From the Middle East, coffee drinking spread to Italy, then to the rest of Europe, and coffee plants were transported by the Dutch to the East Indies and to the Americas. Kola nut use appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many West African cultures, in both private and social settings, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs. The earliest evidence of cocoa bean use comes from residue found in an ancient Mayan pot dated to 600 BCE. Also, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called xocolatl, often seasoned with vanilla, chile pepper, and achiote. Xocolatl was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the theobromine and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, and cocoa beans were often used as currency. Xocolatl was introduced to Europe by the Spaniards, and became a popular beverage by 1700. The Spaniards also introduced the cacao tree into the West Indies and the Philippines. The leaves and stems of the yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) were used by Native Americans to brew a tea called asi or the ""black drink"". Archaeologists have found evidence of this use far into antiquity, possibly dating to Late Archaic times. === Chemical identification, isolation, and synthesis === In 1819, the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time; he called it ""Kaffebase"" (i.e., a base that exists in coffee). According to Runge, he did this at the behest of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In 1821, caffeine was isolated both by the French chemist Pierre Jean Robiquet and by another pair of French chemists, Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou, according to Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in his yearly journal. Furthermore, Berzelius stated that the French chemists had made their discoveries independently of any knowledge of Runge's or each other's work. However, Berzelius later acknowledged Runge's priority in the extraction of caffeine, stating: ""However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his Phytochemical Discoveries, 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name Caffeebase a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris."" Pelletier's article on caffeine was the first to use the term in print (in the French form Caféine from the French word for coffee: café). It corroborates Berzelius's account: Caffeine, noun (feminine). Crystallizable substance discovered in coffee in 1821 by Mr. Robiquet. During the same period – while they were searching for quinine in coffee because coffee is considered by several doctors to be a medicine that reduces fevers and because coffee belongs to the same family as the cinchona [quinine] tree – on their part, Messrs. Pelletier and Caventou obtained caffeine; but because their research had a different goal and because their research had not been finished, they left priority on this subject to Mr. Robiquet. We do not know why Mr. Robiquet has not published the analysis of coffee which he read to the Pharmacy Society. Its publication would have allowed us to make caffeine better known and give us accurate ideas of coffee's composition ... Robiquet was one of the first to isolate and describe the properties of pure caffeine, whereas Pelletier was the first to perform an elemental analysis. In 1827, M. Oudry isolated ""théine"" from tea, but in 1838 it was proved by Mulder and by Carl Jobst that theine was actually the same as caffeine. In 1895, German chemist Hermann Emil Fischer (1852–1919) first synthesized caffeine from its chemical components (i.e. a ""total synthesis""), and two years later, he also derived the structural formula of the compound. This was part of the work for which Fischer was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902. === Historic regulations === Because it was recognized that coffee contained some compound that acted as a stimulant, first coffee and later also caffeine has sometimes been subject to regulation. For example, in the 16th century Islamists in Mecca and in the Ottoman Empire made coffee illegal for some classes. Charles II of England tried to ban it in 1676, Frederick II of Prussia banned it in 1777, and coffee was banned in Sweden at various times between 1756 and 1823. In 1911, caffeine became the focus of one of the earliest documented health scares, when the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of Coca-Cola syrup in Chattanooga, Tennessee, alleging the caffeine in its drink was ""injurious to health"". Although the Supreme Court later ruled in favor of Coca-Cola in United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola, two bills were introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1912 to amend the Pure Food and Drug Act, adding caffeine to the list of ""habit-forming"" and ""deleterious"" substances, which must be listed on a product's label. == Society and culture == === Regulations === ==== United States ==== The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers safe beverages containing less than 0.02% caffeine; but caffeine powder, which is sold as a dietary supplement, is unregulated. It is a regulatory requirement that the label of most prepackaged foods must declare a list of ingredients, including food additives such as caffeine, in descending order of proportion. However, there is no regulatory provision for mandatory quantitative labeling of caffeine, (e.g., milligrams caffeine per stated serving size). There are a number of food ingredients that naturally contain caffeine. These ingredients must appear in food ingredient lists. However, as is the case for ""food additive caffeine"", there is no requirement to identify the quantitative amount of caffeine in composite foods containing ingredients that are natural sources of caffeine. While coffee or chocolate are broadly recognized as caffeine sources, some ingredients (e.g., guarana, yerba maté) are likely less recognized as caffeine sources. For these natural sources of caffeine, there is no regulatory provision requiring that a food label identify the presence of caffeine nor state the amount of caffeine present in the food. The FDA guidance was updated in 2018. === Consumption === Global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000 tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance. The consumption of caffeine has remained stable between 1997 and 2015. Coffee, tea and soft drinks are the most common caffeine sources, with energy drinks contributing little to the total caffeine intake across all age groups. === Religions === The Seventh-day Adventist Church asked for its members to ""abstain from caffeinated drinks"", but has removed this from baptismal vows (while still recommending abstention as policy). Some from these religions believe that one is not supposed to consume a non-medical, psychoactive substance, or believe that one is not supposed to consume a substance that is addictive. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has said the following with regard to caffeinated beverages: ""... the Church revelation spelling out health practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) does not mention the use of caffeine. The Church's health guidelines prohibit alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and 'hot drinks' – taught by Church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee."" Gaudiya Vaishnavas generally also abstain from caffeine, because they believe it clouds the mind and overstimulates the senses. To be initiated under a guru, one must have had no caffeine, alcohol, nicotine or other drugs, for at least a year. Caffeinated beverages are widely consumed by Muslims. In the 16th century, some Muslim authorities made unsuccessful attempts to ban them as forbidden ""intoxicating beverages"" under Islamic dietary laws. == Other organisms == The bacteria Pseudomonas putida CBB5 can live on pure caffeine and can cleave caffeine into carbon dioxide and ammonia. Caffeine is toxic to birds and to dogs and cats, and has a pronounced adverse effect on mollusks, various insects, and spiders. This is at least partly due to a poor ability to metabolize the compound, causing higher levels for a given dose per unit weight. Caffeine has also been found to enhance the reward memory of honey bees. == Research == Caffeine has been used to double chromosomes in haploid wheat. == See also == Adderall Amphetamine Cocaine Health effects of coffee Health effects of tea List of chemical compounds in coffee Low caffeine coffee Methylliberine Nootropic Theobromine Theophylline Wakefulness-promoting agent == References == Notes Citations == Bibliography == == External links == GMD MS Spectrum Caffeine: ChemSub Online Caffeine at The Periodic Table of Videos (University of Nottingham)"	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.0008751357, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -1.9361265e-07, ' FOOD': -8.657073e-06}
176	3-methyl-l-histidine	PUBMED	 Anserine/carnosine supplementation improves cerebral blood flow and verbal episodic memory in elderly people, as we previously reported. Anserine's buffering activity is superior to that of carnosine at neutral pH. In human sera, carnosine but not anserine is rapidly cleaved by carnosinase, limiting its effectiveness. This study examined the effects of anserine on AβPPswe/PSEN1dE9 Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice over 18-months old, an age at which these mice exhibit detectable memory deficits. We found that 8 weeks of anserine treatment completely recovered the memory deficits, improved pericyte coverage on endothelial cells in the brain, and diminished chronic glial neuroinflammatory reactions in these mice. These results suggest that anserine (beta-alanyl-3-methyl-L-histidine) supplementation improved memory functions in AD-model mice by exerting a protective effect on the neurovascular units, which are composed of endothelial cells, pericytes, and supporting glial cells. A new chromatographic procedure is proposed for measuring 3 methyl-L-histidine (3 MH) in human urine. The sample was purified on a cation-exchange resin (AGR 50W-X4) and analysed by ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography on a PARTISIL 10 SCX Whatman column in UV light at 210 nm within 16 min. This procedure gave similar outputs of 3 MH to those described in human normal urine (mean +/- SEM = 213 +/- 15 mumol X 24 h-1, n = 19). It was used to measure the urinary outputs of 3 MH of five patients admitted to an intensive surgical care unit, for 48, 28, 25, 15 and 10 days, respectively. The urinary outputs of 3 MH were normal or lower than normal. The 10(3) urinary 3 MH/creatinine molar ratios were also calculated; this new 3 MH analysis could help the reanimator to prescribe an adequate nutritional assessment. The 3-methyl-l-histidine levels were determined in the whole muscles from cheek, flank, round, neck and loin regions of the bovine carcass and in the corresponding myosins prepared from them. Titres were similar between the muscles in the latter three locations, but very low in cheek muscle. This finding was reflected by a very low titre for the myosin prepared from this source.

177	Meloxicam	WIKIPEDIA	"Meloxicam, sold under the brand name Mobic among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammation in rheumatic diseases and osteoarthritis. It is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein. It is recommended that it be used for as short a period as possible and at a low dose. Common side effects include abdominal pain, dizziness, swelling, headache, and a rash. Serious side effects may include heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and stomach ulcers. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy. It blocks cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) more than it blocks cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). It is in the oxicam family of chemicals and is closely related to piroxicam. Meloxicam was patented in 1977 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2000. It was developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 29th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 18 million prescriptions. An intravenous version of meloxicam (Anjeso) was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2020. == Adverse effects == Meloxicam use can result in gastrointestinal toxicity and bleeding, headaches, rash, and very dark or black stool (a sign of intestinal bleeding). It has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than diclofenac, piroxicam, naproxen, and perhaps all other NSAIDs which are not COX-2 selective. In October 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the prescription drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. === Cardiovascular === Like other NSAIDs, its use is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. Although meloxicam inhibits formation of thromboxane A, it does not appear to do so at levels that would interfere with platelet function. A pooled analysis of randomized, controlled studies of meloxicam therapy of up to 60 days duration found that meloxicam was associated with a statistically significantly lower number of thromboembolic complications than the NSAID diclofenac (0.2% versus 0.8% respectively) but a similar incidence of thromboembolic events to naproxen and piroxicam. People with hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes are at risk for cardiovascular side effects. People with family history of heart disease, heart attack, or stroke should tell their treating physician as the potential for serious cardiovascular side effects is significant. === Gastrointestinal === NSAIDs cause an increase in the risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events. == Mechanism of action == Meloxicam blocks cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme responsible for converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H2—the first step in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation. Meloxicam has been shown, especially at low therapeutic doses, to selectively inhibit COX-2 over COX-1. Meloxicam concentrations in synovial fluid range from 40% to 50% of those in plasma. The free fraction in synovial fluid is 2.5 times higher than in plasma, due to the lower albumin content in synovial fluid compared to plasma. The significance of this penetration is unknown, but it may account for the fact that it performs exceptionally well in treatment of arthritis in animal models. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === The bioavailability of meloxicam is decreased when administered orally compared to an equivalent IV bolus dose. Different oral formulations of meloxicam are not bioequivalent. Use of oral meloxicam following a high-fat breakfast increases the mean peak drug levels by about 22%; however, the manufacturer does not make any specific meal recommendations. In addition, the use of antacids does not show pharmacokinetic interactions. With chronic dosing, the time to maximum plasma concentration following oral administration is approximately 5–6 hours. === Distribution === The mean volume of distribution of meloxicam is approximately 10 L. It is highly protein-bound, mainly to albumin. === Metabolism === Meloxicam is extensively metabolized in the liver by the enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (minor) into four inactive metabolites. Peroxidase activity is thought to be responsible for the other two remaining metabolites. === Excretion === Meloxicam is predominantly excreted in the form of metabolites and occurs to equal extents in the urine and feces. Traces of unchanged parent drug are found in urine and feces. The mean elimination half-life ranges from 15 to 20 hours. == Specific populations == The use of meloxicam is not recommended in people with peptic ulcer disease or increased gastrointestinal bleeding risk, including those over 75 years of age or those taking medications associated with bleeding risk. Adverse events are dose-dependent and associated with length of treatment. == Veterinary use == Meloxicam is used in veterinary medicine mainly to treat dogs, but also sees off-label use in other animals such as cattle and exotics. In the European Union and other countries it is not considered off-label and can be used in cattle, pigs, horses, dogs, cats and guinea pigs. It has also been investigated as an alternative to diclofenac by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) to prevent deaths of vultures. Depending on the animal species, each country or union of countries applies different guidelines or legal frameworks for the use of the drug, as well as different recorded side effects. The most common side effects in dogs include gastrointestinal irritation (vomiting, diarrhea, and ulceration). As far as the perioperative administration is concerned, in healthy dogs given meloxicam, no perioperative adverse effects on the cardiovascular system have been reported at recommended dosages. Perioperative administration of meloxicam to cats did not affect postoperative respiratory rate nor heart rate. === Use of meloxicam in cats === The issue of using meloxicam in cats involves conflicting guidelines, differing legislation, and a narrow therapeutic safety margin that can easily turn the drug from cure to poison. More specifically: ==== US policy vs EU policy ==== The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the use of meloxicam in cats only in injectable form and only as a one-time injection given before surgery. It does not approve meloxicam oral suspension for cats and it does not approve meloxicam spray for cats because after reviewing numerous reports of meloxicam side effects in cats, it has identified many cases of acute renal failure and death and has added the following boxed warning to the products' label: ""Repeated use of meloxicam in cats has been associated with acute renal failure and death. Do not administer additional injectable or oral meloxicam to cats. See Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions for detailed information."" In contrast, in the European Union and other continents or countries, the use of the drug in cats is allowed with no such warning. The product instruction leaflet for meloxicam for cats in the form of oral suspension 0.5 mg/ml states that: ""Typical adverse reactions of NSAIDs such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, faecal occult blood, apathy, and renal failure have occasionally been reported. These side effects are in most cases transient and disappear following termination of the treatment but in very rare cases may be serious or fatal."" ==== Dosage and safety margin ==== The data sheets for meloxicam products for cats also state that: ""Meloxicam has a narrow therapeutic safety margin in cats and clinical signs of overdose may be seen at relatively small overdose levels."" The dosage policy for meloxicam oral suspension products for cats as described in the data sheets defines the amount administered as proportional to body weight. There is no separate dosage guideline for overweight or obese cats. Similarly, there is no separate dosage instruction for elderly cats. This information is important because, shifting attention briefly to the human medical field, where more studies have been conducted, there are medical opinions suggesting that the typical dosage of certain medications can lead to toxicity if factors such as obesity or the patient’s age are not taken into account. ==== Additional studies ==== Some additional information about giving meloxicam to cats from researchers is as follows: A peer-reviewed journal article cites NSAIDs, including meloxicam, as causing gastrointestinal upset and, at high doses, acute kidney injury and CNS signs such as seizures and comas in cats. It adds that cats have a low tolerance for NSAIDs. Also, in another scientific journal there is talk of research according to which cats that received meloxicam had greater proteinuria at 6 months than cats that received placebo. It was concluded that meloxicam should be used with caution in cats with chronic kidney disease. === Pharmacokinetics === In dogs, the absorption of meloxicam from the stomach is not affected by the presence of food, with the peak concentration (Cmax) of meloxicam occurring in the blood 7–8 hours after administration. The half-life of meloxicam is approximately 24 hours in dogs. In the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), very little meloxicam is absorbed into the blood after oral administration (that is, it has poor bioavailability). === Legal status === ==== United States ==== 2003: Meloxicam was approved in the US for use in dogs for the management of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, as an oral (liquid) formulation of meloxicam. 2003 (November): An injectable formulation for use in dogs was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 2004 (October): A formulation for use in cats was approved for use before surgery only. This is an injectable meloxicam, indicated for as a single, one-time dose only, with specific and repeated warnings not to administer a second dose. 2005 (January): The product insert added a warning in bold-face type: ""Do not use in cats."" 2005: The FDA sent a Notice of Violation to the manufacturer for its promotional materials which included promotion of the drug for off-label use. 2020 (February): A meloxicam injection was approved for use in the United States. Specifically, the FDA granted the approval of Anjeso to Baudax Bio. ==== European Union ==== In the European Union, meloxicam is licensed for other anti-inflammatory benefits including relief from both acute and chronic pain in dogs. Meloxicam is also licensed for use in horses, to relieve the pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders. 1998 (January): Meloxicam was authorised for use in cattle throughout the European Union, via a centralised marketing authorisation. 2006: The first generic meloxicam product was approved. 2024 (January): EMA issued an 'Opinion' on a change to this medicine's authorisation concerning the follow-up oral treatment after initial injectable administration in cats. This change remains as an 'Opinion', while the medication continues to be approved as usual. ==== Other countries ==== As of June 2008, meloxicam is registered for long-term use in cats in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In the United Kingdom, meloxicam is licensed for use in cats, guinea pigs, horses, and livestock including pigs and cattle. == See also == Bupivacaine/meloxicam == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
178	Benzoylecgonine	WIKIPEDIA	Benzoylecgonine is the main metabolite of cocaine, formed by the liver and excreted in the urine. It is the compound tested for in most cocaine urine drug screens and in wastewater screenings for cocaine use. == Biochemistry and physiology == Chemically, benzoylecgonine is the benzoate ester of ecgonine. It is a primary metabolite of cocaine, and is pharmacologically inactive. It is the corresponding carboxylic acid of cocaine, its methyl ester. It is formed in the liver by the metabolism of cocaine by hydrolysis, catalysed by carboxylesterases, and subsequently excreted in the urine. It is readily synthesised by boiling cocaine freebase in water. == Urinalysis == Benzoylecgonine is the compound tested for in most substantive cocaine drug urinalyses. == Presence in drinking water == Benzoylecgonine is sometimes found in drinking water supplies. In 2005, scientists found surprisingly large quantities of benzoylecgonine in Italy's Po River and used its concentration to estimate the number of cocaine users in the region. In 2006, a similar study was performed in the Swiss ski town of Saint-Moritz using wastewater to estimate the daily cocaine consumption of the population. A study done in the United Kingdom found traces of benzoylecgonine in the country's drinking water supply, along with carbamazepine (an anticonvulsant) and ibuprofen (a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), although the study noted that the amount of each compound present was several orders of magnitude lower than the therapeutic dose and therefore did not pose a risk to the population. Preliminary studies on ecological systems show that benzoylecgonine has potential toxicity issues. Research is being conducted on degradation options such as advanced oxidation and photocatalysis for this metabolite in an effort to reduce concentrations in waste and surface waters. At environmentally relevant concentrations, benzoylecgonine has been shown to have a negative ecological impact. == See also == Coca alkaloids Dihydrocuscohygrine Hygrine == References ==	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.25713107}
179	Sertraline	WIKIPEDIA	"Sertraline, sold under the brand name Zoloft among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. The effectiveness of sertraline for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants such as Fluoxetine or Paroxetine. Sertraline is better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants. Sertraline is effective for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Although approved for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), findings have shown sertraline leads to only modest improvements in symptoms. Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently (luteal phase dosing) for its treatment. Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, mild sedation, dry mouth, and sexual dysfunction, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild. Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a mildly elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in people under the age of 25 years old. It should not be used together with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): this combination may cause serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening in some cases. Sertraline taken during pregnancy is associated with an increase in congenital heart defects in newborns. Sertraline was invented and developed by scientists at Pfizer and approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2016, sertraline was the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication in the United States. In 2022, it was the eleventh most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 39 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == Sertraline has been approved for major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and Generalized anxiety disorder(GAD). Sertraline is approved for use in children with OCD. === Depression === In meta-analyses, sertraline displays similar efficacy to other SSRI antidepressants, with an odds ratio for response in clinical depression of between 1.44 and 1.67. However, as with other antidepressants, the nature and clinical significance of this effect remain disputed. A major study of sertraline in a broad primary care population found improvements in general mental health, quality of life, and anxiety. However, it failed to find significant effects on depression in either the mildly or severely depressed, and the clinical relevance and accuracy of the positive effects found have been questioned. In several double-blind studies, sertraline was consistently more effective than placebo for dysthymia, a more chronic variety of depression, and comparable to imipramine in that respect. Sertraline also improves the functional impairments of dysthymia to a similar degree whether group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy is undergone or not. Limited pediatric data also demonstrates a reduction in depressive symptoms in the pediatric population though remains a second-line therapy after fluoxetine. ==== Comparison with other antidepressants ==== In general, sertraline efficacy is similar to that of other antidepressants. For example, a meta-analysis of 12 new-generation antidepressants showed that sertraline and escitalopram are the best in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of adults with depression. Comparative clinical trials demonstrated that sertraline is similar in efficacy against depression to moclobemide, nefazodone, escitalopram, bupropion, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. Sertraline may be more efficacious for the treatment of depression in the acute phase (first four weeks) than fluoxetine. There are differences between sertraline and some other antidepressants in their efficacy in the treatment of different subtypes of depression and in their adverse effects. For severe depression, sertraline is as good as clomipramine but is better tolerated. Sertraline appears to work better in melancholic depression than fluoxetine, paroxetine, and mianserin and is similar to the tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. In the treatment of depression accompanied by OCD, sertraline performs significantly better than desipramine on the measures of both OCD and depression. Sertraline is equivalent to imipramine for the treatment of depression with co-morbid panic disorder, but it is better tolerated. Compared with amitriptyline, sertraline offered a greater overall improvement in quality of life of depressed patients. ==== Depression in elderly ==== Sertraline used for the treatment of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients is superior to placebo and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) amitriptyline, nortriptyline and imipramine. Sertraline has much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurs more frequently with sertraline. In addition, sertraline appears to be more effective than fluoxetine or nortriptyline in the older-than-70 subgroup. Accordingly, a meta-analysis of antidepressants in older adults found that sertraline, paroxetine and duloxetine were better than placebo. However, in a 2003 trial the effect size was modest, and there was no improvement in quality of life as compared to placebo. With depression in dementia, there is no benefit of sertraline treatment compared to either placebo or mirtazapine. === Obsessive–compulsive disorder === Sertraline is effective for the treatment of OCD in adults, adolescents and children. It was better tolerated and, based on intention-to-treat analysis, performed better than the gold standard of OCD treatment clomipramine. Continuing sertraline treatment helps prevent relapses of OCD with long-term data supporting its use for up to 24 months. The sertraline dosages necessary for the effective treatment of OCD are higher than the usual dosage for depression. The onset of action is also slower for OCD than for depression. The treatment recommendation is to start treatment with half of the maximal recommended dose for at least two months. After that, the dose can be raised to the maximal recommended in the cases of unsatisfactory response. Cognitive behavioral therapy alone is not more effective than sertraline in adolescents and children; however, a combination of these treatments is effective. === Panic disorder === Sertraline is superior to placebo for the treatment of panic disorder. The response rate was independent of the dose. In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in an improvement in quality of life on most parameters. The patients rated as ""improved"" on sertraline reported better quality of life than the ones who ""improved"" on placebo. The authors of the study argued that the improvement achieved with sertraline is different and of a better quality than the improvement achieved with a placebo. Sertraline is equally effective for men and women, and for patients with or without agoraphobia. Previous unsuccessful treatment with benzodiazepines does not diminish its efficacy. However, the response rate was lower for the patients with more severe panic. Starting treatment simultaneously with sertraline and clonazepam, with subsequent gradual discontinuation of clonazepam, may accelerate the response. Double-blind comparative studies found sertraline to have the same effect on panic disorder as paroxetine or imipramine. While imprecise, comparison of the results of trials of sertraline with separate trials of other anti-panic agents (clomipramine, imipramine, clonazepam, alprazolam, and fluvoxamine) indicates approximate equivalence of these medications. === Other anxiety disorders === Sertraline has been successfully used for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. All three major domains of the disorder (fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms) respond to sertraline. Maintenance treatment, after the response is achieved, prevents the return of the symptoms. The improvement is greater among the patients with later, adult onset of the disorder. In a comparison trial, sertraline was superior to exposure therapy, but patients treated with the psychological intervention continued to improve during a year-long follow-up, while those treated with sertraline deteriorated after treatment termination. The combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be more effective in children and young people than either treatment alone. Sertraline has not been approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder; however, several guidelines recommend it as a first-line medication referring to good quality controlled clinical trials. === Premenstrual dysphoric disorder === Sertraline is effective in alleviating the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Significant improvement was observed in 50–60% of cases treated with sertraline vs. 20–30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began during the first week of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better family functioning, social activity, and general quality of life. Work functioning and physical symptoms, such as swelling, bloating, and breast tenderness, were less responsive to sertraline. Taking sertraline only during the luteal phase, that is, the 12–14 days before menses is not as effective as continuous treatment. Continuous treatment with sub-therapeutic doses of sertraline (25 mg vs. usual 50–100 mg) is also effective. === Other indications === Sertraline is approved for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends it for patients who prefer drug treatment to a psychological one. Other guidelines also suggest sertraline as a first-line option for pharmacological therapy. When necessary, long-term pharmacotherapy can be beneficial. There are both negative and positive clinical trial results for sertraline, which may be explained by the types of psychological traumas, symptoms, and comorbidities included in the various studies. Positive results were obtained in trials that included predominantly women (75%) with a majority (60%) having physical or sexual assault as the traumatic event. Somewhat contrary to the above suggestions, a meta-analysis of sertraline clinical trials for PTSD found it to be statistically superior to placebo in the reduction of PTSD symptoms but the effect size was small. Another meta-analysis relegated sertraline to the second line, proposing trauma focused psychotherapy as a first-line intervention. The authors noted that Pfizer had declined to submit the results of a negative trial for inclusion in the meta-analysis making the results unreliable. Sertraline, when taken daily, can be useful for the treatment of premature ejaculation. A disadvantage of sertraline is that it requires continuous daily treatment to delay ejaculation significantly. A 2019 systematic review suggested that sertraline may be a good way to control anger, irritability, and hostility in depressed patients and patients with other comorbidities. == Contraindications == Sertraline is contraindicated in individuals taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or the antipsychotic pimozide. Sertraline concentrate contains ethanol and is therefore contraindicated with disulfiram. The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment ""must be approached with caution"". Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may be as high as three times the average exposure for the same dose. == Side effects == Nausea, ejaculation failure, insomnia, diarrhea, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, tremor, headache, excessive sweating, fatigue, restless legs syndrome and decreased libido are the common adverse effects associated with sertraline with the greatest difference from placebo. Those that most often result in interruption of the treatment are nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia. The incidence of diarrhea is higher with sertraline – especially when prescribed at higher doses – in comparison with other SSRIs. Over more than six months of sertraline therapy for depression, people showed no significant weight increase. A 30-month-long treatment with sertraline for OCD also resulted in no significant weight gain. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the average weight gain was lower for fluoxetine (1%) but higher for citalopram, fluvoxamine and paroxetine (2.5%). Of the sertraline group, 4.5% gained a large amount of weight (defined as more than 7% gain). This result compares favorably with placebo, where, according to the literature, 3–6% of patients gained more than 7% of their initial weight. The large weight gain was observed only among female members of the sertraline group; the significance of this finding is unclear because of the small size of the group. Over a two-week treatment of healthy volunteers, sertraline slightly improved verbal fluency but did not affect word learning, short-term memory, vigilance, flicker fusion time, choice reaction time, memory span, or psychomotor coordination. In spite of lower subjective rating, that is, feeling that they performed worse, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the objective cognitive performance in a group of people treated for depression with sertraline for 1.5 years as compared to healthy controls. In children and adolescents taking sertraline for six weeks for anxiety disorders, 18 out of 20 measures of memory, attention, and alertness stayed unchanged. Divided attention was improved and verbal memory under interference conditions decreased marginally. Because of the large number of measures taken, it is possible that these changes were still due to chance. The unique effect of sertraline on dopaminergic neurotransmission may be related to these effects on cognition and vigilance. Sertraline has a low level of exposure of an infant through the breast milk and is recommended as the preferred option for the antidepressant therapy of breast-feeding mothers. There is 29–42% increase in congenital heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed sertraline during pregnancy, with sertraline use in the first trimester associated with 2.7-fold increase in septal heart defects. Abrupt interruption of sertraline treatment may result in withdrawal or discontinuation syndrome. Dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, agitation, and irritability are common symptoms. It typically occurs within a few days from drug discontinuation and lasts a few weeks. The withdrawal symptoms for sertraline are less severe and frequent than for paroxetine, and more frequent than for fluoxetine. In most cases symptoms are mild, short-lived, and resolve without treatment. More severe cases are often successfully treated by temporary reintroduction of the drug with a slower tapering-off rate. Sertraline and SSRI antidepressants in general may be associated with bruxism and other movement disorders. Sertraline appears to be associated with microscopic colitis, a rare condition of unknown etiology. === Sexual === Like other SSRIs, sertraline is associated with sexual side effects, including sexual arousal disorder, erectile dysfunction and difficulty achieving orgasm. While nefazodone and bupropion do not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties versus 18% before the treatment. Sexual arousal disorder, defined as ""inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and erectile difficulties for men"", occurred in 12% of people on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo. The mood improvement resulting from the treatment with sertraline sometimes counteracted these side effects, so that sexual desire and overall satisfaction with sex stayed the same as before the sertraline treatment. However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved. Some people continue experiencing sexual side effects after they stop taking SSRIs. === Suicide === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including sertraline, to carry a boxed warning stating that antidepressants increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25 years. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 100% increase of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 50% increase in the 18–24 age group. Suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical trials are rare. For the above analysis, the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain statistically significant results. Considered separately, sertraline use in adults decreased the odds of suicidal behavior with a marginal statistical significance of 37% or 50% depending on the statistical technique used. The authors of the FDA analysis note that ""given the large number of comparisons made in this review, chance is a very plausible explanation for this difference"". The more complete data submitted later by the sertraline manufacturer Pfizer indicated increased suicidal behavior. Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK MHRA found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the patients on sertraline as compared to the ones on placebo. == Overdose == Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia and seizures. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of sertraline and norsertraline, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. As with most other SSRIs its toxicity in overdose is considered relatively low. == Interactions == As with other SSRIs, sertraline may increase the risk of bleeding with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid), antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements due to sertraline's inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation via blocking serotonin transporters on platelets. Sertraline, in particular, may potentially diminish the efficacy of levothyroxine. Sertraline is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Accordingly, in human trials it caused increased blood levels of CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, dextromethorphan, desipramine, imipramine and nortriptyline, as well as the CYP3A4/CYP2D6 substrate haloperidol. This effect is dose-dependent; for example, co-administration with 50 mg of sertraline resulted in 20% greater exposure to desipramine, while 150 mg of sertraline led to a 70% increase. In a placebo-controlled study, the concomitant administration of sertraline and methadone caused a 40% increase in blood levels of the latter, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6. Bupropion is metabolized by CYP2B6, which is inhibited by sertraline, and this may result in an interaction between sertraline and bupropion. Sertraline had a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of diazepam, tolbutamide, and warfarin, which are CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates; the clinical relevance of this effect was unclear. As expected from in vitro data, sertraline did not alter the human metabolism of the CYP3A4 substrates erythromycin, alprazolam, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and terfenadine; neither did it affect metabolism of the CYP1A2 substrate clozapine. Sertraline did not affect the actions of digoxin and atenolol, which are not metabolized in the liver. Case reports suggest that taking sertraline with phenytoin or zolpidem may induce sertraline metabolism and decrease its efficacy, and that taking sertraline with lamotrigine may increase the blood level of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation. CYP2C19 inhibitor esomeprazole increased sertraline concentrations in blood plasma by approximately 40%. Clinical reports indicate that interaction between sertraline and the MAOIs isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine may cause serotonin syndrome. In a placebo-controlled study in which sertraline was co-administered with lithium, 35% of the subjects experienced tremors, while none of those taking placebo did. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). By binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT) it inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin and potentiates serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. Over time, this leads to a downregulation of pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which is associated with an improvement in passive stress tolerance, and delayed downstream increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which may contribute to a reduction in negative affective biases. It does not significantly affect histamine, acetylcholine, GABA or benzodiazepine receptors. Sertraline also shows relatively high activity as an inhibitor of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and antagonist of the sigma σ1 receptor (but not the σ2 receptor). However, sertraline affinity for its main target (SERT) is much greater than its affinity for σ1 receptor and DAT. Although there could be a role for the σ1 receptor in the pharmacology of sertraline, the significance of this receptor in its actions is unclear. Similarly, the clinical relevance of sertraline's blockade of the dopamine transporter is uncertain. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Following a single oral dose of sertraline, mean peak blood levels of sertraline occur between 4.5 and 8.4 hours. Bioavailability is likely linear and dose-proportional over a dose range of 150 to 200 mg. Concomitant intake of sertraline with food slightly increases sertraline peak levels and total exposure. There is an approximate 2-fold accumulation of sertraline with continuous administration and steady-state levels are reached within one week. ==== Distribution ==== Sertraline is highly plasma protein bound (98.5%) across a concentration range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. Despite the high plasma protein binding, sertraline and its metabolite desmethylsertraline at respective tested concentrations of 300 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL were found not to interfere with the plasma protein binding of warfarin and propranolol, two other highly plasma protein-bound drugs. ==== Metabolism ==== Sertraline is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism, as indicated by a small study of radiolabeled sertraline in which less than 5% of plasma radioactivity was unchanged sertraline in two males. The principal metabolic pathway for sertraline is N-demethylation into desmethylsertraline (N-desmethylsertraline) mainly by CYP2B6. Reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation of both sertraline and desmethylsertraline also occur. Desmethylsertraline, while pharmacologically active, is substantially (50-fold) weaker than sertraline as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and its influence on the clinical effects of sertraline is thought to be negligible. Based on in vitro studies, sertraline is metabolized by multiple cytochrome 450 isoforms; however, it appears that in the human body CYP2C19 plays the most important role, followed by CYP2B6. In addition to the cytochrome P450 system, sertraline can be oxidatively deaminated in vitro by monoamine oxidases; however, this metabolic pathway has never been studied in vivo. ==== Elimination ==== The elimination half-life of sertraline is on average 26 hours, with a range of 13 to 45 hours. The elimination half-life of desmethylsertraline is 62 to 104 hours. In a small study of two males, sertraline was excreted to similar degrees in urine and feces (40 to 45% each within 9 days). Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in urine, whereas 12 to 14% of unchanged sertraline was present in feces. === Pharmacogenomics === CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 are thought to be the key cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of sertraline. Relative to CYP2C19 normal (extensive) metabolizers, poor metabolizers have 2.7-fold higher levels of sertraline and intermediate metabolizers have 1.4-fold higher levels. In contrast, CYP2B6 poor metabolizers have 1.6-fold higher levels of sertraline and intermediate metabolizers have 1.2-fold higher levels. == History == The history of sertraline dates back to the early 1970s when Pfizer chemist Reinhard Sarges invented a novel series of psychoactive compounds, including lometraline, based on the structures of the neuroleptics thiothixene and pinoxepin. Further work on these compounds led to tametraline, a norepinephrine and weaker dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired stimulant effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist Kenneth Koe, after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated several potent norepinephrine and triple reuptake inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive cis-analogs was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared stereoisomers of this compound, which were tested in vivo by animal behavioral scientist Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type—in that sense their inquiry was not ""very goal driven"", and the invention of the sertraline molecule was serendipitous. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even ""did not have a formal project team"". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company. Sertraline was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991 based on the recommendation of the Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee; it had already become available in the United Kingdom the previous year. The FDA committee achieved a consensus that sertraline was safe and effective for the treatment of major depression. During the discussion, Paul Leber, the director of the FDA Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products, noted that granting approval was a ""tough decision"", since the treatment effect on outpatients with depression had been ""modest to minimal"". Other experts emphasized that the drug's effect on inpatients had not differed from placebo and criticized the poor design of the clinical trials by Pfizer. For example, 40% of participants dropped out of the trials, significantly decreasing their validity. Until 2002, sertraline was only approved for use in adults ages 18 and over; that year, it was approved by the FDA for use in treating children aged 6 or older with severe OCD. In 2003, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued guidance that, apart from fluoxetine (Prozac), SSRIs are not suitable for the treatment of depression in patients under 18. However, sertraline can still be used in the UK for the treatment of OCD in children and adolescents. In 2005, the FDA added a boxed warning concerning pediatric suicidal behavior to all antidepressants, including sertraline. In 2007, labeling was again changed to add a warning regarding suicidal behavior in young adults ages 18 to 24. == Society and culture == === Generic availability === The US patent for Zoloft expired in 2006, and sertraline is available in generic form and is marketed under many brand names worldwide. === Brand names === In the US, Zoloft is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. === Interest during COVID-19 pandemic === Sertraline has been the most sought-after antidepressant worldwide before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Google Trends data. The pandemic has led to an increase in searches for antidepressants, with sertraline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine showing the highest search volumes, whereas searches of citalopram decreased during the pandemic. == Other uses == Sertraline may be useful to treat murine Zaire ebolavirus (murine EBOV). The World Health Organization (WHO) considers this a promising area of research. Lass-Flörl et al., 2003 finds it significantly inhibits phospholipase B in the fungal genus Candida, reducing virulence. Sertraline is also a very effective leishmanicide. Specifically, Palit & Ali 2008 find that sertraline kills almost all promastigotes of Leishmania donovani. Sertraline is strongly antibacterial against some species. It is also known to act as a photosensitizer of bacterial surfaces. In combination with antibacterials its photosensitization effect reverses antibacterial resistance. As such sertraline shows promise for food preservation. Lass-Flörl et al., 2003 finds this compound acts as a fungicide against Candida parapsilosis. Its anti-Cp effect is indeed due to its serotonergic activity and not its other effects. Sertraline is a promising trypanocide. It acts at several different life stages and against several strains. Sertraline's trypanocidal mechanism of action is by way of interference with bioenergetics. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
180	Abrine	PUBMED	 Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is responsible for tumor immune escape by regulating T cell-associated immune responses and promoting the activation of immunosuppressive. Given the vital role of IDO1 in immune response, further investigation on the regulation of IDO1 in tumors is needed. Herein, we used ELISA kit to detect the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Tryptophan (Trp), and kynurenic acid (Kyn) levels; western blot, Flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays detected the expression of the proteins; Molecular docking assay, SPR assay and Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) were used to detect the interaction between IDO1 and Abrine; nano live label-free system was used to detect the phagocytosis activity; tumor xenografts animal experiments were used to explore the anti-tumor effect of Abrine; flow cytometry detected the immune cells changes. The important immune and inflammatory response cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) up-regulated the IDO1 expression in cancer cells through the methylation of 6-methyladenosine (m6A) m6A modification of RNA, metabolism of Trp into Kyn, and JAK1/STAT1 signaling pathway, which could be inhibited by IDO1 inhibitor Abrine. CD47 is IFN-γ-stimulated genes (ISGs) and prevents the phagocytosis of macrophages, leading to the cancer immune escape, and this effect could be inhibited by Abrine both in vivo and in vitro. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is an important immune checkpoint in regulating immune response, overexpression of PD-1 or PD-L1 promotes immune suppression, while in this study Abrine could inhibit the expression of PD-L1 in cancer cells or tumor tissue. The combination treatment of Abrine and anti-PD-1 antibody has a synergistic effect on suppressing the tumor growth through up-regulating CD4 Overall, this study reveals that Abrine as an IDO1 inhibitor has an inhibition effect on immune escape and has a synergistic effect with the anti-PD-1 antibody on the treatment of HCC. Osteoarthritis (OA), a common joint disorder with an increasing incidence worldwide, severely affects the quality of life of patients. In Chinese herbal medicine, Abrus cantoniensis Hance is considered to exert protective effects on the liver and to have beneficial effects on the gallbladder; additionally, it has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as the ability to enhance immunity, scavenge free radicals, regulate smooth muscle function, and improve endurance. Abrine extracted from A. cantoniensis Hance has been reported as a main functional compound capable of treating chronic inflammation. In this study, we explored the effect of abrine on OA progression. Bioinformatics analysis was performed on abrine and its potential targets in OA, using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, GSE1919 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and docking interaction analysis. The effect of abrine in vitro was analysed by Cell Counting Kit 8 assays, colony formation assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blotting using human transformed chondrocyte cell line C28/I2. The effect of abrine was evaluated in vivo using the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) Sprague-Dawley rat OA model. Abrine enhanced the proliferation of interleukin (IL)-1β-stimulated C28/I2 cells in a dose-dependant manner. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was induced by IL-1β treatment, whereas abrine treatment repressed the induction of C28/I2 cells in a dose dependant manner (p < 0.05). Abrine induced cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in IL-1β-stimulated C28/I2 cells (p < 0.05). Abrine also inhibited Proviral Integrations of Moloney virus 2 (PIM2) expression in IL-1β-stimulated C28/I2 cells (p < 0.05). The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), p-VEGFR2, and p-eNOS was induced by IL-1β treatment in C28/I2 cells, while abrine inhibited this induction in a dose dependant manner. Treatment with abrine decreased the expression levels of PIM2 and VEGF in IL-1β-stimulated C28/I2 cells (p < 0.05). Overexpression of PIM2 induced cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in IL-1β-stimulated C28/I2 cells, while VEGF silencing reversed this effect (p < 0.05). Finally, abrine prevented cartilage degradation in the ACLT model. We demonstrated that abrine promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in IL-1β-stimulated C28/I2 cells through PIM2/VEGF signalling. These findings indicate PIM2 to be a potential drug target. Moreover, abrine has potential applicability as a therapeutic agent against OA. Liver cancer is the most malignant type of human malignancies. In recent years, immune therapy that targets the immune check points such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) has achieve great success. Abrine is the dominant alkaloid in  Cell viability, proliferation, and migration were assessed by CCK-8, Edu, and Transwell assay. Cell apoptosis was checked by flow cytometry. Tumor growth was determined by an  Abrine treatment suppressed liver tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo and simultaneously decreased the level of PD-L1 and KAT5. In the coculture system, treatment with abrine inhibited proliferation and activity of cocultured T cell. KAT5 epigenetically elevated recruitment of H3k27ac and RNA polymerase II to PD-L1 promoter region. Ectopic expression of KAT5 and PD-L1 reversed the function of abrine on tumor growth and T cell function. Abrine modulated growth and apoptosis of liver cancer cells and regulated proliferation and activation of T cells through the KAT5/PD-L1 axis.

181	Alfuzosin	WIKIPEDIA	Alfuzosin, sold under the brand name Uroxatral among others, is a medication of the α1 blocker class. It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As an antagonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, it works by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making urination easier. Alfuzosin was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1988. It was approved in the US for benign prostatic hyperplasia in 2003. In 2020, it was the 336th-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700 thousand prescriptions. == Side effects == The most common side effects are dizziness (due to postural hypotension), upper respiratory tract infection, headache, fatigue, and abdominal disturbances. Side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, and congested nose. Adverse effects of alfuzosin are similar to that of tamsulosin, but with 70% lower rate of retrograde ejaculation. == Chemistry == Alfuzosin contains a stereocenter, so is chiral, with two enantiomeric forms, (R)- and (S)-alfuzosin. The drug is used as a racemate, (RS)-alfuzosin, a 1:1 mixture of the (R)- and (S)- forms. It is provided as the hydrochloride salt. == Society and culture == === Brand names === It is sold under the brand names Alfosoft, Uroxatral, Xatral, Prostetrol, and Alfural. == Synthesis == The nitration of veratraldehyde [120-14-9] (1) gives 6-Nitroveratraldehyde [20357-25-9] (2). Oxidation of the aldehyde to the acid, halogenation with thionyl chloride and amide formation with ammonia gives 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzamide [4959-60-8] (3). Béchamp reduction of the nitro group gives 2-amino-4,5-dimethoxybenzamide [5004-88-6] (4). Reaction with urea leads to 6,7-Dimethoxyquinazoline-2,4-dione [28888-44-0] (5). Halogenation with phosphoryl chloride gives 2,4-Dichloro-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline [27631-29-4] (6). Treatment with one equivalent of ammonia yields 4-Amino-2-chloro-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline [23680-84-4] (7). The reaction of 2-Tetrahydrofuroic Acid [16874-33-2] (8) with Ethyl chloroformate [541-41-3] (9) gives Ethoxycarbonyl oxolane-2-carboxylate, PC10997775 (10). Treatment of the mixed anhydride with 3-Methylaminopropionitrile [693-05-0] (11) gives N-(2-Cyanoethyl)tetrahydro-N-methyl-2-furancarboxamide [72104-44-0] (12). Catalytic hydrogenation gives N-(3-Aminopropyl)tetrahydro-N-methyl-2-furancarboxamide [72104-45-1] (13). Migration of the amide methyl group to the terminal position gives N-[3-(methylamino)propyl]oxolane-2-carboxamide [81403-67-0] (14). Convergent synthesis between the two coutnerparts completed the synthesis of Alfuzosin (15). == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
183	Citalopram	WIKIPEDIA	"Citalopram, sold under the brand name Celexa among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia. The antidepressant effects may take one to four weeks to occur. It is typically taken orally (swallowed by mouth). In some European countries, it is sometimes given intravenously (injected into a vein) to initiate treatment, before switching to the oral route of administration for continuation of treatment. It has also been used intravenously in other parts of the world in some other circumstances. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, sexual problems, shakiness, feeling tired, and sweating. Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, glaucoma, and QT prolongation. It should not be used in persons who take or have recently taken an MAO inhibitor. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Citalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 40th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Depression === In the United States, citalopram is approved to treat major depressive disorder. Citalopram appears to have comparable efficacy and superior tolerability relative to other antidepressants. In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ranking of ten antidepressants for efficacy and cost-effectiveness, citalopram is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline) and fourth in cost-effectiveness. Evidence for the effectiveness of citalopram for treating depression in children is uncertain. === Panic disorder === Citalopram is licensed in the UK and other European countries for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. === Other === Citalopram may be used off-label to treat anxiety, and dysthymia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. It appears to be as effective as fluvoxamine and paroxetine in obsessive–compulsive disorder. Some data suggest the effectiveness of intravenous infusion of citalopram in resistant OCD. Citalopram is well tolerated and as effective as moclobemide in social anxiety disorder. There are studies suggesting that citalopram can be useful in reducing aggressive and impulsive behavior. It appears to be superior to placebo for behavioural disturbances associated with dementia. It has also been used successfully for hypersexuality in early Alzheimer's disease. A meta-analysis, including studies with fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram versus placebo, showed SSRIs to be effective in reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, whether taken continuously or just in the luteal phase. For alcoholism, citalopram has produced a modest reduction alcohol intake and increase in drink-free days in studies of alcoholics, possibly by decreasing desire or reducing the reward. While on its own citalopram is less effective than amitriptyline in the prevention of migraines, in refractory cases, combination therapy may be more effective. Citalopram and other SSRIs can be used to treat hot flashes.: 107 A 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in autistic children from citalopram, raising doubts about whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in children with autism. Some research suggests citalopram interacts with cannabinoid protein-couplings in the rat brain, and this is put forward as a potential cause of some of the drug's antidepressant effects. == Administration == Citalopram is typically taken in one dose, either in the morning or evening. It can be taken with or without food. Its absorption does not increase when taken with food, but doing so can help prevent nausea. Nausea is often caused when the 5-HT3 receptors actively absorb free serotonin, as this receptor is present within the digestive tract. == Adverse effects == Citalopram theoretically causes side effects by increasing the concentration of serotonin in other parts of the body (e.g., the intestines). Other side effects, such as increased apathy and emotional flattening, may be caused by the decrease in dopamine release associated with increased serotonin. Citalopram is also a mild antihistamine, which may be responsible for some of its sedating properties.: 104 Other common side effects of citalopram include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, hyperactivity and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime rather than in the morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares. Citalopram is associated with a higher risk of arrhythmia than other SSRIs. Citalopram and other SSRIs can induce a mixed state, especially in those with undiagnosed bipolar disorder.: 105 According to an article published in 2020, one of the other rare side effects of Citalopram could be triggering visual snow syndrome; which does not resolve after the discontinuation of the medicine. === Sexual dysfunction === Sexual dysfunction is often a side effect of SSRIs. Some people experience persistent sexual side effects when taking SSRIs or after discontinuing them. Symptoms of medication-induced sexual dysfunction from antidepressants include difficulty with orgasm, erection, or ejaculation. Other symptoms may be genital anesthesia, anhedonia, decreased libido, vaginal lubrication issues, and nipple insensitivity in women. Rates are unknown, and there is no established treatment. === Abnormal heart rhythm === In August 2011, the FDA announced, ""Citalopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. Citalopram should no longer be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day"". A further clarification, issued in March 2012, restricted the maximum dose to 20 mg for subgroups of patients, including those older than 60 years and those taking an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C19.7. === Endocrine effects === As with other SSRIs, citalopram can cause an increase in serum prolactin level. Citalopram has no significant effect on insulin sensitivity in women of reproductive age and no changes in glycaemic control were seen in another trial. === Exposure in pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including citalopram) during pregnancy is associated with shorter duration of gestation (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). Antidepressant exposure is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. It is uncertain whether there is an increased prevalence of septal heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed an SSRI in early pregnancy. === Overdose === Overdosage may result in vomiting, sedation, disturbances in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremors, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions.: 105 Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with citalopram as the sole agent. Citalopram and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma citalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 50-400 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000–3000 μg/L in patients who survive acute overdosage, and 3–30 mg/L in those who do not survive. It is the most dangerous of SSRIs in overdose. === Suicidality === In the United States, citalopram carries a boxed warning stating it may increase suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24. === Discontinuation Syndrome === SSRI discontinuation syndrome has been reported when treatment is stopped. It includes sensory, and gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, lethargy, and sleep disturbances, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety/agitation, irritability, and poor concentration. Electric shock-like sensations are typical for SSRI discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as paraesthesiae, sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems. Treatment with citalopram should be reduced gradually when treatment is finished. == Interactions == === Serotonin Syndrome === Citalopram should not be taken with St John's wort, tryptophan or 5-HTP as the resulting drug interaction could lead to serotonin syndrome. With St John's wort, this may be caused by compounds in the plant extract reducing the efficacy of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes that process citalopram. Tryptophan and 5-HTP are precursors to serotonin. When taken with an SSRI, such as citalopram, this can lead to levels of serotonin that can be lethal. This may also be the case when SSRIs are taken with SRAs (serotonin releasing agents) such as in the case of MDMA. It is possible that SSRIs could reduce the effects associated with an SRA since SSRIs stop the reuptake of Serotonin by blocking SERT. This would allow less serotonin in and out of the transporters, thus decreasing the likelihood of neurotoxic effects. However, these concerns are still disputed as the exact pharmacodynamic effects of citalopram and MDMA have yet to be fully identified. Citalopram is contraindicated in individuals taking MAOIs, owing to a potential for serotonin syndrome. === Other interactions === SSRIs, including citalopram, can increase the risk of bleeding, especially when coupled with aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants. Taking citalopram with omeprazole may cause higher blood levels of citalopram. This is a potentially dangerous interaction, so dosage adjustments may be needed or alternatives may be prescribed. == Pharmacokinetics == Citalopram is considered safe and well tolerated in the therapeutic dose range. Distinct from some other agents in its class, it exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interaction potential, making it a better choice for the elderly or comorbid patients. == Stereochemistry == Citalopram has one stereocenter, to which a 4-fluoro phenyl group and an N, N-dimethyl-3-aminopropyl group bind. As a result of this chirality, the molecule exists in (two) enantiomeric forms (mirror images). They are termed S-(+)-citalopram and R-(–)-citalopram. Citalopram is sold as a racemic mixture, consisting of 50% (R)-(−)-citalopram and 50% (S)-(+)-citalopram. Only the (S)-(+) enantiomer has the desired antidepressant effect. Lundbeck now markets the (S)-(+) enantiomer, the generic name of which is escitalopram. Whereas citalopram is supplied as the hydrobromide, escitalopram is sold as the oxalate salt (hydrooxalate). In both cases, the salt forms of the amine make these otherwise lipophilic compounds water-soluble. == Metabolism == Citalopram is metabolized in the liver mostly by CYP2C19, but also by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Metabolites desmethylcitalopram and didesmethylcitalopram are significantly less energetic and their contribution to the overall action of citalopram is negligible. The half-life of citalopram is about 35 hours. Approximately 80% is cleared by the liver and 20% by the kidneys. The elimination process is slower in the elderly and in patients with liver or kidney failure. With once-daily dosing, steady plasma concentrations are achieved in about a week. Potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 and 3A4 might decrease citalopram clearance. Tobacco smoke exposure was found to inhibit the biotransformation of citalopram in animals, suggesting that the elimination rate of citalopram is decreased after tobacco smoke exposure. After intragastric administration, the half-life of the racemic mixture of citalopram was increased by about 287%. == History == Citalopram was first synthesized in 1972 by chemist Klaus Bøgesø and his research group at the pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and was first marketed in 1989 in Denmark. It was first marketed in the US in 1998. The original patent expired in 2003, allowing other companies to legally produce and market generic versions. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Citalopram is sold under these brand names: === European Commission fine === On 19 June 2013, the European Commission imposed a fine of €93.8 million on the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck, plus a total of €52.2 million on several generic pharmaceutical-producing companies. This was in response to Lundbeck entering an agreement with the companies to delay their sales of generic citalopram after Lundbeck's patent on the drug had expired, thus reducing competition in breach of European antitrust law. == Other uses == Citalopram is also a parasiticide. Schistosomula have high mortality when treated with citalopram. == See also == List of antidepressants == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
184	Amitriptyline	WIKIPEDIA	"Amitriptyline, sold under the brand name Elavil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, and a variety of pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, migraine and tension headaches. Due to the frequency and prominence of side effects, amitriptyline is generally considered a second-line therapy for these indications. The most common side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain. Glaucoma, liver toxicity and abnormal heart rhythms are rare but serious side effects. Blood levels of amitriptyline vary significantly from one person to another, and amitriptyline interacts with many other medications potentially aggravating its side effects. Amitriptyline was discovered in the late 1950s by scientists at Merck and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 87th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amitriptyline is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder, neuropathic pain, and for the prevention of migraine and chronic tension headache. It can be used for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children older than 6 after other treatments have failed. === Depression === Amitriptyline is effective for depression, but it is rarely used as a first-line antidepressant due to its higher toxicity in overdose and generally poorer tolerability. It can be tried for depression as a second-line therapy, after the failure of other treatments. For treatment-resistant adolescent depression or for cancer-related depression amitriptyline is no better than placebo; however, the number of treated patients in both studies was small. It is sometimes used for the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease, but supporting evidence for that is lacking. === Pain === Amitriptyline alleviates painful diabetic neuropathy. It is recommended by a variety of guidelines as a first or second-line treatment. It is as effective for this indication as gabapentin or pregabalin but less well tolerated. Amitriptyline is as effective at relieving pain as duloxetine. Combination treatment of amitriptyline and pregabalin offers additional pain relief for people whose pain is not adequately controlled with one medication and is usually safe. Amitriptyline in certain formulations may also induce the level of sciatic-nerve blockade needed for local anesthesia therein. Here, it has been demonstrated to be of superior potency to bupivacaine, a customary long-acting local anesthetic. Low doses of amitriptyline moderately improve sleep disturbances and reduce pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. It is recommended for fibromyalgia accompanied by depression by Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany and as a second-line option for fibromyalgia, with exercise being the first line option, by European League Against Rheumatism. Combinations of amitriptyline and fluoxetine or melatonin may reduce fibromyalgia pain better than either medication alone. There is some (low-quality) evidence that amitriptyline may reduce pain in cancer patients. It is recommended only as a second-line therapy for non-chemotherapy-induced neuropathic or mixed neuropathic pain if opioids did not provide the desired effect. Moderate evidence exists in favor of amitriptyline use for atypical facial pain. Amitriptyline is ineffective for HIV-associated neuropathy. In multiple sclerosis, it is frequently used to treat painful paresthesias in the arms and legs (e.g., burning sensations, pins and needles, stabbing pains) caused by damage to the pain-regulating pathways of the brain and spinal cord. === Headache === Amitriptyline is probably effective for the prevention of periodic migraine in adults. Amitriptyline is similar in efficacy to venlafaxine and topiramate but carries a higher burden of adverse effects than topiramate. For many patients, even very small doses of amitriptyline are helpful, which may allow for minimization of side effects. Amitriptyline is not significantly different from placebo when used for the prevention of migraine in children. Amitriptyline may reduce the frequency and duration of chronic tension headache, but it is associated with worse adverse effects than mirtazapine. Overall, amitriptyline is recommended for tension headache prophylaxis, along with lifestyle advice, which should include avoidance of analgesia and caffeine. === Other indications === Amitriptyline is effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome; however, because of its side effects, it should be reserved for select patients for whom other agents do not work. There is insufficient evidence to support its use for abdominal pain in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Tricyclic antidepressants decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of cyclic vomiting syndrome episodes. Amitriptyline, as the most commonly used of them, is recommended as a first-line agent for its therapy. Amitriptyline may improve pain and urgency intensity associated with bladder pain syndrome and can be used in the management of this syndrome. Amitriptyline can be used in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children. However, its effect is not sustained after the treatment ends. Alarm therapy gives better short- and long-term results. In the US, amitriptyline is commonly used in children with ADHD as an adjunct to stimulant medications without any evidence or guideline supporting this practice. Many physicians in the UK (and the US also) commonly prescribe amitriptyline for insomnia; however, Cochrane reviewers were not able to find any randomized controlled studies that would support or refute this practice. Similarly, a major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of amitriptyline for insomnia. The well-known sedating effects of amitriptyline, however, bear understanding on and arguable justification for this practice. It may function similarly to doxepin in this regard, although the evidence for doxepin is more robust. Trimipramine may be a more novel alternative given its tendency to not suppress but brighten R.E.M. sleep. == Contraindications and precautions == The known contraindications of amitriptyline are: Amitriptyline should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy, impaired liver function, pheochromocytoma, urinary retention, prostate enlargement, hyperthyroidism, and pyloric stenosis. In patients with the rare condition of shallow anterior chamber of eyeball and narrow anterior chamber angle, amitriptyline may provoke attacks of acute glaucoma due to dilation of the pupil. It may aggravate psychosis, if used for depression with schizophrenia, or precipitate the switch to mania in those with bipolar disorder. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should avoid amitriptyline due to increased side effects. If it is necessary to use it, half dose is recommended. Amitriptyline can be used during pregnancy and lactation when SSRIs have been shown not to work. == Side effects == The most frequent side effects, occurring in 20% or more of users, are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain (on average 1.8 kg). Other common side effects are headache problems (amblyopia, blurred vision), tachycardia, increased appetite, tremor, fatigue/asthenia/feeling slowed down, and dyspepsia. A less common side effect of amitriptyline is urination problems (8.7%). Amitriptyline can increase suicidal thoughts and behavior in people under the age of 24 and the US FDA required a boxed warning to be added to the prescription label. Amitriptyline-associated sexual dysfunction (occurring at a frequency of 6.9%) seems to be mostly confined to males with depression and is expressed predominantly as erectile dysfunction and low libido disorder, with lesser frequency of ejaculatory and orgasmic problems. The rate of sexual dysfunction in males treated for indications other than depression and in females is not significantly different from placebo. Liver test abnormalities occur in 10–12% of patients on amitriptyline, but are usually mild, asymptomatic, and transient, with consistently elevated alanine transaminase in 3% of all patients. The increases of the enzymes above the 3-fold threshold of liver toxicity are uncommon, and cases of clinically apparent liver toxicity are rare; nevertheless, amitriptyline is placed in the group of antidepressants with greater risks of hepatic toxicity. Amitriptyline prolongs the QT interval. This prolongation is relatively small at therapeutic doses but becomes severe in overdose. == Overdose == The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other TCAs, including the presentation of serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. The British National Formulary notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose, thus it and other TCAs are no longer recommended as first-line therapy for depression. The treatment of overdose is mostly supportive as no specific antidote for amitriptyline overdose is available. Activated charcoal may reduce absorption if given within 1–2 hours of ingestion. If the affected person is unconscious or has an impaired gag reflex, a nasogastric tube may be used to deliver the activated charcoal into the stomach. ECG monitoring for cardiac conduction abnormalities is essential and if one is found close monitoring of cardiac function is advised. Body temperature should be regulated with measures such as heating blankets if necessary. Cardiac monitoring is advised for at least five days after the overdose. Benzodiazepines are recommended to control seizures. Dialysis is of no use due to the high degree of protein binding with amitriptyline. == Interactions == Since amitriptyline and its active metabolite nortriptyline are primarily metabolized by cytochromes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 (see its pharmacology), the inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to exhibit pharmacokinetic interactions with amitriptyline. According to the prescribing information, the interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the plasma level of amitriptyline. However, the results in the other literature are inconsistent: the co-administration of amitriptyline with a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine does increase the plasma levels of amitriptyline two-fold and of the main active metabolite nortriptyline 1.5-fold, but combination with less potent CYP2D6 inhibitors thioridazine or levomepromazine does not affect the levels of amitriptyline and increases nortriptyline by about 1.5-fold; a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor fluoxetine does not seem to have a significant effect on the levels of amitriptyline or nortriptyline. A case of clinically significant interaction with potent CYP2D6 inhibitor terbinafine has been reported. A potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes fluvoxamine increases the level of amitriptyline two-fold while slightly decreasing the level of nortriptyline. Similar changes occur with a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes cimetidine: amitriptyline level increases by about 70%, while nortriptyline decreases by 50%. CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole elevates amitriptyline level by about a quarter. On the other hand, cytochrome P450 inducers such as carbamazepine and St. John's Wort decrease the levels of both amitriptyline and nortriptyline Oral contraceptives may increase the blood level of amitriptyline by as high as 90%. Valproate moderately increases the levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline through an unclear mechanism. The prescribing information warns that the combination of amitriptyline with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may cause potentially lethal serotonin syndrome; however, this has been disputed. The prescribing information cautions that some patients may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate. However, other literature states that there is little or no interaction: in a pharmacokinetic study topiramate only increased the level of amitriptyline by 20% and nortriptyline by 33%. Amitriptyline counteracts the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. When given with amitriptyline, other anticholinergic agents may result in hyperpyrexia or paralytic ileus. Co-administration of amitriptyline and disulfiram is not recommended due to the potential for the development of toxic delirium. Amitriptyline causes an unusual type of interaction with the anticoagulant phenprocoumon during which great fluctuations of the prothrombin time have been observed. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Amitriptyline inhibits serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). It is metabolized to nortriptyline, a stronger norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, further augmenting amitriptyline's effects on norepinephrine reuptake (see table in this section). Amitriptyline additionally acts as a potent inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, the α1A-adrenergic, the histamine H1 and the M1-M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see table in this section). Amitriptyline is a non-selective blocker of multiple ion channels, in particular, voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.3, Nav1.5, Nav1.6, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8, voltage-gated potassium channels Kv7.2/ Kv7.3, Kv7.1, Kv7.1/KCNE1, and hERG. === Mechanism of action === Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters by amitriptyline results in interference with neuronal reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Since the reuptake process is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity, this action may potentiate or prolong the activity of serotonergic and adrenergic neurons and is believed to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline. Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake leads to an increased concentration of norepinephrine in the posterior gray column of the spinal cord appears to be mostly responsible for the analgesic action of amitriptyline. Increased level of norepinephrine increases the basal activity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which mediate an analgesic effect by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission among spinal interneurons. The blocking effect of amitriptyline on sodium channels may also contribute to its efficacy in pain conditions. === Pharmacokinetics === Amitriptyline is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (90–95%). Absorption is gradual with the peak concentration in blood plasma reached after about 4 hours. Extensive metabolism on the first pass through the liver leads to average bioavailability of about 50% (45%-53%). Amitriptyline is metabolized mostly by CYP2C19 into nortriptyline and by CYP2D6 leading to a variety of hydroxylated metabolites, with the principal one among them being (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline (see metabolism scheme), and to a lesser degree, by CYP3A4. Nortriptyline, the main active metabolite of amitriptyline, is an antidepressant on its own right. Nortriptyline reaches 10% higher level in the blood plasma than the parent drug amitriptyline and 40% greater area under the curve, and its action is an important part of the overall action of amitriptyline. Another active metabolite is (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline, which is a norepinephrine uptake inhibitor four times weaker than nortriptyline. (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline blood level is comparable to that of nortriptyline, but its cerebrospinal fluid level, which is a close proxy of the brain concentration of a drug, is twice higher than nortriptyline's. Based on this, (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline was suggested to significantly contribute to the antidepressant effects of amitriptyline. Blood levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline and pharmacokinetics of amitriptyline in general, with clearance difference of up to 10-fold, vary widely between individuals. Variability of the area under the curve in steady state is also high, which makes a slow upward titration of the dose necessary. In the blood, amitriptyline is 96% bound to plasma proteins; nortriptyline is 93–95% bound, and (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline is about 60% bound. Amitriptyline has an elimination half life of 21 hours, nortriptyline – 23–31 hours, and (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline − 8–10 hours. Within 48 hours, 12−80% of amitriptyline is eliminated in the urine, mostly as metabolites. 2% of the unchanged drug is excreted in the urine. Elimination in the feces, apparently, have not been studied. Therapeutic levels of amitriptyline range from 75 to 175 ng/mL (270–631 nM), or 80–250 ng/mL of both amitriptyline and its metabolite nortriptyline. === Pharmacogenetics === Since amitriptyline is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, genetic variations within the genes coding for these enzymes can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of amitriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have ""normal"" metabolism of amitriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use amitriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. The consortium also recommends considering an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19 in patients who are CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. A reduction in the starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If the use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. == Chemistry == Amitriptyline is a highly lipophilic molecule having an octanol-water partition coefficient (pH 7.4) of 3.0, while the log P of the free base was reported as 4.92. Solubility of the free base amitriptyline in water is 14 mg/L. Amitriptyline is prepared by reacting dibenzosuberane with 3-(dimethylamino)propylmagnesium chloride and then heating the resulting intermediate product with hydrochloric acid to eliminate water. == History == Amitriptyline was first developed by the American pharmaceutical company Merck in the late 1950s. In 1958, Merck approached several clinical investigators proposing to conduct clinical trials of amitriptyline for schizophrenia. One of these researchers, Frank Ayd, instead, suggested using amitriptyline for depression. Ayd treated 130 patients and, in 1960, reported that amitriptyline had antidepressant properties similar to another, and the only known at the time, tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. Following this, the US Food and Drug Administration approved amitriptyline for depression in 1961. In Europe, due to a quirk of the patent law at the time allowing patents only on the chemical synthesis but not on the drug itself, Roche and Lundbeck were able to independently develop and market amitriptyline in the early 1960s. According to research by a historian of psychopharmacology David Healy, amitriptyline became a much bigger selling drug than its precursor imipramine because of two factors. First, amitriptyline has a much stronger anxiolytic effect. Second, Merck conducted a marketing campaign raising clinicians' awareness of depression as a clinical entity. == Society and culture == In the 2021 film The Many Saints of Newark, amitriptyline (referred to by the brand name Elavil) is part of the plot line of the movie. === Names === Amitriptyline is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while amitriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are amitriptilina, in German is Amitriptylin, and in Latin is amitriptylinum. The embonate salt is known as amitriptyline embonate, which is its BANM, or as amitriptyline pamoate unofficially. === Prescription trends === Between 1998 and 2017, along with imipramine, amitriptyline was the most commonly prescribed first antidepressant for children aged 5–11 years in England. It was also the most prescribed antidepressant (along with fluoxetine) for 12- to 17-year-olds. == Research == The few randomized controlled trials investigating amitriptyline efficacy in eating disorder have been discouraging. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == Further reading == Dean L (March 2017).

185	Venlafaxine	WIKIPEDIA	"Venlafaxine, sold under the brand name Effexor among others, is an antidepressant medication of the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Studies have shown that venlafaxine improves post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It may also be used for chronic neuropathic pain. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). It is also available as the salt venlafaxine besylate (venlafaxine benzenesulfonate monohydrate) in an extended-release formulation (Venbysi XR). Common side effects include loss of appetite, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, sweating, insomnia, drowsiness and sexual problems. Severe side effects include an increased risk of suicide, mania, and serotonin syndrome. Antidepressant withdrawal syndrome may occur if stopped. There are concerns that use during the later part of pregnancy can harm the baby. How it works is not entirely clear, but it seems to be related to the potentiation of the activity of some neurotransmitters in the brain. Venlafaxine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1993. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 44th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Venlafaxine is used primarily for the treatment of depression, general anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, and vasomotor symptoms. Venlafaxine has been used off label for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and migraine prevention. It may work on pain via effects on the opioid receptor. It has also been found to reduce the severity of 'hot flashes' in menopausal women and men on hormonal therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer. Due to its action on both the serotoninergic and adrenergic systems, venlafaxine is also used as a treatment to reduce episodes of cataplexy, a form of muscle weakness, in patients with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Some open-label and three double-blind studies have suggested the efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Clinical trials have found possible efficacy in those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Case reports, open trials and blinded comparisons with established medications have suggested the efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder. === Depression === A comparative meta-analysis of 21 major antidepressants found that venlafaxine, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants, although the quality of many comparisons was assessed as low or very low. Venlafaxine was similar in efficacy to the atypical antidepressant bupropion; however, the remission rate was lower for venlafaxine. In a double-blind study, patients who did not respond to an SSRI were switched to either venlafaxine or another SSRI (citalopram); similar improvement was observed in both groups. Studies have not established its efficacy for use in pediatric populations. In children and adolescents with depression, venlafaxine increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or attempts. Higher doses (e.g., 225 mg and 375 mg per day) of venlafaxine are more effective than lower doses (e.g., 75 mg per day) but also cause more side effects. Studies have shown that the extended-release is superior to the immediate-release form of venlafaxine. A 2017 meta-analysis has showed that the efficacy of venlafaxine is not correlated with baseline severity of depression. In other words, regardless of how severe a person's depression is at treatment initiation, the efficacy of venlafaxine remains consistent and is not influenced by the severity of depression at the start of treatment. == Contraindications == Venlafaxine is not recommended in patients hypersensitive to it, nor should it be taken by anyone who is allergic to the inactive ingredients, which include gelatin, cellulose, ethylcellulose, iron oxide, titanium dioxide and hypromellose. It should not be used in conjunction with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as it can cause potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. Venlafaxine might interact with tramadol or other opioids, as well as trazodone, so caution is needed while mixing multiple serotonergic agents together. == Adverse effects == Venlafaxine can increase eye pressure, so those with glaucoma may require more frequent eye checks. A 2017 meta-analysis estimated venlafaxine discontinuation rate due to adverse effects to be 9.4%. === Suicide === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including venlafaxine, to carry a black box warning with a generic warning about a possible suicide risk. A 2014 meta-analysis of 21 clinical trials of venlafaxine for the treatment of depression in adults found that compared to placebo, venlafaxine reduced the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. A study conducted in Finland followed more than 15,000 patients for 3.4 years. Venlafaxine increased suicide risk by 60% (statistically significant), as compared to no treatment. At the same time, fluoxetine (Prozac) halved the suicide risk. In a study sponsored by Wyeth, which produces and markets venlafaxine, the data on more than 200,000 cases were obtained from the UK general practice research database. At baseline, patients prescribed venlafaxine had a greater number of risk factors for suicide (such as prior suicide attempts) than patients treated with other anti-depressants. The patients taking venlafaxine had a significantly higher risk of suicide than the ones on fluoxetine or citalopram (Celexa). After adjusting for known risk factors, venlafaxine was associated with an increased risk of suicide relative to fluoxetine and dothiepin which was not statistically significant. A statistically significant greater risk for attempted suicide remained after adjustment, but the authors concluded that it could be due to residual confounding. An analysis of clinical trials by the FDA statisticians showed the incidence of suicidal behaviour among the adults on venlafaxine to be not significantly different from fluoxetine or placebo. Venlafaxine is contraindicated in children, adolescents, and young adults. In children and adolescents with depression, venlafaxine increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or attempts. === Serotonin syndrome === The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome (also classified as ""serotonin toxicity"") may occur with venlafaxine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, including but not limited to SSRIs and SNRIs, many hallucinogens such as tryptamines and phenethylamines (e.g., LSD/LSA, DMT, MDMA, mescaline), dextromethorphan (DXM), tramadol, tapentadol, pethidine (meperidine) and triptans and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Venlafaxine-induced serotonin syndrome has also been reported when venlafaxine has been taken in isolation in overdose. An abortive serotonin syndrome state, in which some but not all of the symptoms of the full serotonin syndrome are present, has been reported with venlafaxine at mid-range dosages (150 mg per day). A case of a patient with serotonin syndrome induced by low-dose venlafaxine (37.5 mg per day) has also been reported. === Pregnancy === There are few well-controlled studies of venlafaxine in pregnant women. A study released in May 2010 by the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests use of venlafaxine doubles the risk of miscarriage. Consequently, venlafaxine should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. A large case-control study done as part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and published in 2012 found a significant association between venlafaxine use during pregnancy and several birth defects including anencephaly, cleft palate, septal heart defects and coarctation of the aorta. Prospective studies have not shown any statistically significant congenital malformations. There have, however, been some reports of self-limiting effects on newborn infants. As with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), these effects are generally short-lived, lasting only 3 to 5 days, and rarely resulting in severe complications. === Bipolar disorder === According to the ISBD Task Force report on antidepressant use in bipolar disorder, during the course of treatment for depression with those suffering from bipolar I and II, venlafaxine ""appears to carry a particularly high risk of inducing pathologically elevated states of mood and behavior."" Because venlafaxine appears to be more likely than SSRIs and bupropion to induce mania and mixed episodes in these patients, provider discretion is advised through ""carefully evaluating individual clinical cases and circumstances."" === Liver injury === A rare but serious side effect of venlafaxine is liver injury. It appears to affect both male and female patients with a median age of 44. Cessation of venlafaxine is one of the appropriate measures of management. While the mechanism of venlafaxine-related liver injury remains unclear, findings suggest that it may be related to a CYP2D6 polymorphism. === Overdose === Most patients overdosing with venlafaxine develop only mild symptoms. Plasma venlafaxine concentrations in overdose survivors have ranged from 6 to 24 mg/L, while postmortem blood levels in fatalities are often in the 10–90 mg/L range. Published retrospective studies report that venlafaxine overdosage may be associated with an increased risk of fatal outcome compared to that observed with SSRI antidepressant products, but lower than that for tricyclic antidepressants. Healthcare professionals are advised to prescribe Effexor and Effexor XR in the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management to reduce the risk of overdose. It is usually reserved as a second-line treatment for depression due to a combination of its superior efficacy to the first-line treatments like fluoxetine, paroxetine and citalopram and greater frequency of side effects like nausea, headache, insomnia, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, sexual dysfunction, sweating and nervousness. There is no specific antidote for venlafaxine, and management is generally supportive, providing treatment for the immediate symptoms. Administration of activated charcoal can prevent absorption of the drug. Monitoring of cardiac rhythm and vital signs is indicated. Seizures are managed with benzodiazepines or other anticonvulsants. Forced diuresis, hemodialysis, exchange transfusion, or hemoperfusion are unlikely to be of benefit in hastening the removal of venlafaxine, due to the drug's high volume of distribution. === Withdrawal syndrome === People stopping venlafaxine commonly experience SSRI withdrawal symptoms such as dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sensation of electric shocks (commonly called ""brain zaps""), and sleep disturbance. Venlafaxine has a higher rate of moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms relative to other antidepressants (similar to the SSRI paroxetine). The higher risk and increased severity of withdrawal symptoms relative to other antidepressants may be related to the short half-life of venlafaxine and its active metabolite. After stopping venlafaxine, the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine decrease, leading to the hypothesis that the withdrawal symptoms could result from an overly rapid reduction of neurotransmitter levels. === Other === In rare cases, drug-induced akathisia can occur after use in some people. Venlafaxine should be used with caution in hypertensive patients. Venlafaxine must be discontinued if significant hypertension persists. It can also have undesirable cardiovascular effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Venlafaxine is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has also been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). It is described as 'synthetic phenethylamine bicyclic derivative with antidepressant activity'. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin and norepinephrine. Additionally, in high doses, it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine. The frontal cortex largely lacks dopamine transporters; therefore venlafaxine can increase dopamine neurotransmission in this part of the brain. Venlafaxine selectively inhibits the serotonin transporter at lower doses, but at a dose of 225 mg per day it additionally blocks the norepinephrine transporter (NET), as measured by the intravenous tyramine pressor test. Venlafaxine indirectly affects opioid receptors as well as the α2-adrenergic receptor, and was shown to increase pain threshold in mice. These benefits with respect to pain were reversed with naloxone, an opioid antagonist, thus supporting an opioid mechanism. === Pharmacokinetics === Venlafaxine is well absorbed, with at least 92% of an oral dose being absorbed into systemic circulation. It is extensively metabolized in the liver via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme to desvenlafaxine (O-desmethylvenlafaxine, now marketed as a separate medication named Pristiq), which is just as potent an SNRI as the parent compound, meaning that the differences in metabolism between extensive and poor metabolisers are not clinically important in terms of efficacy. Side effects, however, are reported to be more severe in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and its metabolite are attained in the blood within 3 days. Therapeutic effects are usually achieved within 3 to 4 weeks. No accumulation of venlafaxine has been observed during chronic administration in healthy subjects. The primary route of excretion of venlafaxine and its metabolites is via the kidneys. The half-life of venlafaxine is relatively short, so patients are directed to adhere to a strict medication routine, avoiding missing a dose. Even a single missed dose can result in withdrawal symptoms. Venlafaxine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which pumps it out of the brain. The gene encoding P-gp, ABCB1, has the SNP rs2032583, with alleles C and T. The majority of people (about 70% of Europeans and 90% of East Asians) have the TT variant. A 2007 study found that carriers of at least one C allele (variant CC or CT) are 7.72 times more likely than non-carriers to achieve remission after 4 weeks of treatment with amitriptyline, citalopram, paroxetine or venlafaxine (all P-gp substrates). The study included patients with mood disorders other than major depression, such as bipolar II; the ratio is 9.4 if these other disorders are excluded. At the 6-week mark, 75% of C-carriers had remitted, compared to only 38% of non-carriers. == Chemistry == The IUPAC name of venlafaxine is 1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4 methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol, though it is sometimes referred to as (±)-1-[a-[a-(dimethylamino)methyl]-p-methoxybenzyl]cyclohexanol. It consists of two enantiomers present in equal quantities (termed a racemic mixture), both of which have the empirical formula of C17H27NO2. It is usually sold as a mixture of the respective hydrochloride salts, (R/S)-1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4 methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol hydrochloride, C17H28ClNO2, which is a white to off-white crystalline solid. Venlafaxine is structurally and pharmacologically related to the atypical opioid analgesic tramadol, and more distantly to the newly released opioid tapentadol, but not to any of the conventional antidepressant drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, MAOIs, or RIMAs. Venlafaxine extended-release is chemically the same as normal venlafaxine. The extended-release (controlled release) version distributes the release of the drug into the gastrointestinal tract over a longer period than normal venlafaxine. This results in a lower peak plasma concentration. Studies have shown that the extended-release formula has a lower incidence of nausea as a side effect, resulting in better compliance. === Interactions === Venlafaxine should be taken with caution when using St John's wort. Venlafaxine may lower the seizure threshold, and coadministration with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as bupropion and tramadol should be done with caution and at low doses. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Venlafaxine can be abused as a recreational drug, with damages that can manifest within a month. === Brand names === Venlafaxine was originally marketed as Effexor in most of the world; generic venlafaxine has been available since around 2008 and extended-release venlafaxine has been available since around 2010. Venlafaxine is sold under many brand names worldwide. In some countries, Effexor is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == Veterinary uses == Veterinary overdose in dogs is very well treated by Cyproheptadine HCl.: 1371 Venlafaxine is highly toxic to Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta phytoplankton. Cats are drawn to the smell of venlafaxine and tend to ingest the pills, which is highly toxic to them. == References == == Further reading =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
186	Desvenlafaxine	WIKIPEDIA	"Desvenlafaxine, sold under the brand name Pristiq among others, is a medication used to treat depression. It is an antidepressant of the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class and is taken by mouth. It is recommended that the need for further treatment be occasionally reassessed. It may be less effective than its parent compound venlafaxine, although some studies have found comparable efficacy. Common side effects include dizziness, trouble sleeping, increased sweating, constipation, sleepiness, anxiety, and sexual problems. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, bleeding, mania, and high blood pressure. There is a high risk of withdrawal syndrome which may occur if the dose is decreased or the medication is completely stopped. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Desvenlafaxine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2008. In Europe its application for use was denied in 2009. In 2022, it was the 208th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Desvenlafaxine is primarily used as a treatment for major depressive disorder. Use has only been studied up to 8 weeks. It may be less effective than venlafaxine, although some studies have found comparable efficacy with a lower rate of nausea. Doses of 50 to 400 mg/day appear effective for major depressive disorder, although no additional benefit was demonstrated at doses greater than 50 mg/day, and adverse events and discontinuations were more frequent at higher doses. Desvenlafaxine improves the HAM-D17 score and measures of well-being such as the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). == Adverse effects == Frequency of adverse effects: Very common adverse effects include: Common adverse effects include: Uncommon adverse effects include: Rare adverse effects include: Common adverse effects whose intensity is unknown include: == Pharmacology == Desvenlafaxine is a synthetic form of the isolated major active metabolite of venlafaxine, and is categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). When most normal metabolizers take venlafaxine, approximately 70% of the dose is metabolized into desvenlafaxine, so the effects of the two drugs are expected to be very similar. It works by blocking the ""reuptake"" transporters for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It is approximately 10 times more potent at inhibiting serotonin uptake than norepinephrine uptake. == Approval status == === United States === Wyeth announced on 23 January 2007 that it received an approvable letter from the Food and Drug Administration for desvenlafaxine. Final approval to sell the drug was contingent on a number of things, including: A satisfactory FDA inspection of Wyeth's Guayama, Puerto Rico facility, where the drug is to be manufactured; Several postmarketing surveillance commitments, and follow-up studies on low-dose use, relapse, and use in children; Clarity by Wyeth around the company's product education plan for physicians and patients; Approval of desvenlafaxine's proprietary name, Pristiq. The FDA approved the drug for antidepressant use in February 2008, and was to be available in US pharmacies in May 2008. In March 2017, the generic form of the drug was made available in the US. === Canada === On February 4, 2009, Health Canada approved use of desvenlafaxine for treatment of depression. === European Union === In 2009, an application to market desvenlafaxine for major depressive disorder in the European Union was declined. In 2012, Pfizer received authorization in Spain to market desvenlafaxine for the disorder. In August 2022, following a 14-year approval process, desvenlafaxine was brought to the market for the disorder in Germany. === Australia === Desvenlafaxine is classified as a schedule 4 (prescription only) drug in Australia. It was listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) in 2008 for the treatment of major depressive disorders. == See also == List of antidepressants == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
187	Loperamide	WIKIPEDIA	"Loperamide, sold under the brand name Imodium, among others, is a medication of the opioid receptor agonist class used to decrease the frequency of diarrhea. It is often used for this purpose in irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. It is not recommended for those with blood in the stool, mucus in the stool, or fevers. The medication is taken by mouth. Common side effects include abdominal pain, constipation, sleepiness, vomiting, and dry mouth. It may increase the risk of toxic megacolon. Loperamide's safety in pregnancy is unclear, but no evidence of harm has been found. It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. It is an opioid with no significant absorption from the gut and does not cross the blood–brain barrier when used at normal doses. It works by slowing the contractions of the intestines. Loperamide was first made in 1969 and used medically in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Loperamide is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 297th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Loperamide is effective for the treatment of a number of types of diarrhea. This includes control of acute nonspecific diarrhea, mild traveler's diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic diarrhea due to bowel resection, and chronic diarrhea secondary to inflammatory bowel disease. It is also useful for reducing ileostomy output. Off-label uses for loperamide also include chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, especially related to irinotecan use. Loperamide should not be used as the primary treatment in cases of bloody diarrhea, acute exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, or bacterial enterocolitis. Loperamide is often compared to diphenoxylate. Studies suggest that loperamide is more effective and has lower neural side effects. == Side effects == Adverse drug reactions most commonly associated with loperamide are constipation (which occurs in 1.7–5.3% of users), dizziness (up to 1.4%), nausea (0.7–3.2%), and abdominal cramps (0.5–3.0%). Rare, but more serious, side effects include toxic megacolon, paralytic ileus, angioedema, anaphylaxis/allergic reactions, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, urinary retention, and heat stroke. The most frequent symptoms of loperamide overdose are drowsiness, vomiting, and abdominal pain, or burning. High doses may result in heart problems such as abnormal heart rhythms. === Contraindications === Treatment should be avoided in the presence of high fever or if the stool is bloody. Treatment is not recommended for people who could have negative effects from rebound constipation. If suspicion exists of diarrhea associated with organisms that can penetrate the intestinal walls, such as E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella, loperamide is contraindicated as a primary treatment. Loperamide treatment is not used in symptomatic C. difficile infections, as it increases the risk of toxin retention and precipitation of toxic megacolon. Loperamide should be administered with caution to people with liver failure due to reduced first-pass metabolism. Additionally, caution should be used when treating people with advanced HIV/AIDS, as cases of both viral and bacterial toxic megacolon have been reported. If abdominal distension is noted, therapy with loperamide should be discontinued. === Children === The use of loperamide in children under two years is not recommended. Rare reports of fatal paralytic ileus associated with abdominal distention have been made. Most of these reports occurred in the setting of acute dysentery, overdose, and with very young children less than two years of age. A review of loperamide in children under 12 years old found that serious adverse events occurred only in children under three years old. The study reported that the use of loperamide should be contraindicated in children who are under 3, systemically ill, malnourished, moderately dehydrated, or have bloody diarrhea. In 1990, all formulations for children of the antidiarrheal loperamide were banned in Pakistan. The National Health Service in the United Kingdom recommends that loperamide should only be given to children under the age of twelve if prescribed by a doctor. Formulations for children are only available on prescription in the UK. === Pregnancy and breast feeding === Loperamide is not recommended in the United Kingdom for use during pregnancy or by nursing mothers. Studies in rat models have shown no teratogenicity, but sufficient studies in humans have not been conducted. One controlled, prospective study of 89 women exposed to loperamide during their first trimester of pregnancy showed no increased risk of malformations. This, however, was only one study with a small sample size. Loperamide can be present in breast milk and is not recommended for breastfeeding mothers. == Drug interactions == Loperamide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein; therefore, the concentration of loperamide increases when given with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Common P-glycoprotein inhibitors include quinidine, ritonavir, and ketoconazole. Loperamide can decrease the absorption of some other drugs. As an example, saquinavir concentrations can decrease by half when given with loperamide. Loperamide is an antidiarrheal agent, which decreases intestinal movement. As such, when combined with other antimotility drugs, the risk of constipation is increased. These drugs include other opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and anticholinergics. == Mechanism of action == Loperamide is an opioid-receptor agonist and acts on the μ-opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus of the large intestine. It works like morphine, decreasing the activity of the myenteric plexus, which decreases the tone of the longitudinal and circular smooth muscles of the intestinal wall. This increases the time material stays in the intestine, allowing more water to be absorbed from the fecal matter. It also decreases colonic mass movements and suppresses the gastrocolic reflex. Loperamide's circulation in the bloodstream is limited in two ways. Efflux by P-glycoprotein in the intestinal wall reduces the passage of loperamide, and the fraction of drug crossing is then further reduced through first-pass metabolism by the liver. Loperamide metabolizes into an MPTP-like compound, but is unlikely to exert neurotoxicity. === Blood–brain barrier === Efflux by P-glycoprotein also prevents circulating loperamide from effectively crossing the blood-brain barrier, so it can generally only antagonize muscarinic receptors in the peripheral nervous system, and currently has a score of one on the anticholinergic cognitive burden scale. Concurrent administration of P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as quinidine potentially allows loperamide to cross the blood-brain barrier and produce central morphine-like effects. At high doses (>70mg), loperamide can saturate P-glycoprotein (thus overcoming the efflux) and produce euphoric effects. Loperamide taken with quinidine was found to produce respiratory depression, indicative of central opioid action. High doses of loperamide have been shown to cause a mild physical dependence during preclinical studies, specifically in mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys. Symptoms of mild opiate withdrawal were observed following abrupt discontinuation of long-term treatment of animals with loperamide. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === Loperamide is synthesized starting from the lactone 3,3-diphenyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one and ethyl 4-oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate, on a lab scale. On a large scale a similar synthesis is followed, except that the lactone and piperidinone are produced from cheaper materials rather than purchased. === Physical properties === Loperamide is typically manufactured as the hydrochloride salt. Its main polymorph has a melting point of 224 °C and a second polymorph exists with a melting point of 218 °C. A tetrahydrate form has been identified which melts at 190 °C. == History == Loperamide hydrochloride was first synthesized in 1969 by Paul Janssen from Janssen Pharmaceuticals in Beerse, Belgium, following previous discoveries of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (1956) and fentanyl citrate (1960). The first clinical reports on loperamide were published in 1973 in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry with the inventor being one of the authors. The trial name for it was ""R-18553"". Loperamide oxide has a different research code: R-58425. The trial against placebo was conducted from December 1972 to February 1974, its results being published in 1977 in the journal Gut. In 1973, Janssen started to promote loperamide under the brand name Imodium. In December 1976, Imodium got US FDA approval. During the 1980s, Imodium became the best-selling prescription antidiarrheal in the United States. In March 1988, McNeil Pharmaceutical began selling loperamide as an over-the-counter drug under the brand name Imodium A-D. In the 1980s, loperamide also existed in the form of drops (Imodium Drops) and syrup. Initially, it was intended for children's usage, but Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew it from the market in 1990 after 18 cases of paralytic ileus (resulting in six deaths) were registered in Pakistan and reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the following years (1990-1991), products containing loperamide have been restricted for children's use in several countries (ranging from two to five years of age). In the late 1980s, before the US patent expired on 30 January 1990, McNeil started to develop Imodium Advanced containing loperamide and simethicone for treating both diarrhea and gas. In March 1997, the company patented this combination. The drug was approved in June 1997, by the FDA as Imodium Multi-Symptom Relief in the form of a chewable tablet. A caplet formulation was approved in November 2000. In November 1993, loperamide was launched as an orally disintegrating tablet based on Zydis technology. In 2013, loperamide in the form of 2-mg tablets was added to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. In 2020, it was discovered by researchers at Goethe University that Loperamide was effective at killing glioblastoma cells. == Society and culture == === Legal status === ==== United States ==== Loperamide was formerly a controlled substance in the United States. First, it was a Schedule II controlled substance. However, this was lowered to Schedule V. Loperamide was finally removed from control by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1982, courtesy of then-Administrator Francis M. Mullen Jr. ==== UK ==== Loperamide can be sold freely to the public by chemists (pharmacies) as the treatment of diarrhoea and acute diarrhoea associated with medically diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome in adults over 18 years of age === Economics === Loperamide is sold as a generic medication. In 2016, Imodium was one of the biggest-selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £32.7 million. === Brand names === Loperamide was originally marketed as Imodium, and many generic brands are sold. === Off-label/unapproved use === Loperamide has typically been deemed to have a relatively low risk of misuse. In 2012, no reports of loperamide abuse were made. In 2015, however, case reports of extremely high-dose loperamide use were published. The primary intent of users has been to manage symptoms of opioid withdrawal such as diarrhea, although a small portion derive psychoactive effects at these higher doses. At these higher doses central nervous system penetration occurs and long-term use may lead to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal on abrupt cessation. Dubbing it ""the poor man's methadone"", clinicians warned that increased restrictions on the availability of prescription opioids passed in response to the opioid epidemic were prompting recreational users to turn to loperamide as an over-the-counter treatment for withdrawal symptoms. The FDA responded to these warnings by calling on drug manufacturers to voluntarily limit the package size of loperamide for public-safety reasons. However, there is no quantity restriction on number of packages that can be purchased, and most pharmacies do not feel capable of restricting its sale, so it is unclear that this intervention will have any impact without further regulation to place loperamide behind the counter. Since 2015, several reports of sometimes-fatal cardiotoxicity due to high-dose loperamide abuse have been published. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
188	Prochlorperazine	WIKIPEDIA	"Prochlorperazine, formerly sold under the brand name Compazine among others, is a medication used to treat nausea, migraines, schizophrenia, psychosis and anxiety. It is a less preferred medication for anxiety. It may be taken by mouth, rectally, injection into a vein, or injection into a muscle. Common side effects include sleepiness, blurry vision, low blood pressure, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include movement disorders including tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally not recommended. It is a typical antipsychotic which is believed to work by reducing the action of dopamine in the brain. Prochlorperazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1956. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 355th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600 thousand prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Vomiting === Prochlorperazine is used to prevent vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy and in the pre- and postoperative setting. A 2015 Cochrane review found no differences in efficacy among drugs commonly used for this purpose in emergency rooms. === Migraine === Prochlorperazine, generally by intravenous, is used to treat migraine. Such use is recommended by The American Headache Society. A 2019 systematic review found prochlorperazine was nearly three times as likely as metoclopramide to relieve headache within 60 minutes of administration. === Labyrinthitis === In the UK prochlorperazine maleate has been used for labyrinthitis, which includes nausea and vertigo. == Side effects == Sedation is very common, and extrapyramidal side effects are common and include restlessness, dystonic reactions, pseudoparkinsonism, and akathisia; the extrapyramidal symptoms can affect 2% of people at low doses, whereas higher doses may affect as many as 40% of people. Prochlorperazine can also cause a life-threatening condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Some symptoms of NMS include high fever, stiff muscles, neck muscle spasms, confusion, irregular pulse or blood pressure, fast heart rate (tachycardia), sweating, and abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Research from the Veterans Administration and the United States Food and Drug Administration show injection site reactions. Adverse effects are similar in children. === Warning === The FDA-approved label for prochlorperazine includes a warning for increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Pharmacology == Prochlorperazine is thought to exert its antipsychotic effects by blocking dopamine receptors. Prochlorperazine is analogous to chlorpromazine; both of these agents antagonize dopaminergic D2 receptors in various pathways of the central nervous system. This D2 blockade results in antipsychotic, antiemetic and other effects. Hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of dopamine antagonists as blockade of D2 receptors within the tuberoinfundibular pathway results in increased plasma levels of prolactin due to increased secretion by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary. Following intramuscular injection, the antiemetic action is evident within 5 to 10 minutes and lasts for three to four hours. Rapid action is also noted after buccal treatment. With oral dosing, the start of action is delayed but the duration is somewhat longer (approximately six hours). == Society and culture == In the United Kingdom, prochlorperazine is available for the treatment of nausea caused by migraine as a tablet dissolved in the mouth, and in Australia as a tablet swallowed whole. In the UK, it is available via a prescription and as a pharmacy medicine, meaning it does not require a prescription but is only available after talking with a pharmacist. === Marketing === Prochlorperazine is available as tablets, suppositories, and in an injectable form. As of September 2017 it was marketed under the trade names Ametil, Antinaus, Buccastem, Bukatel, Chlormeprazine, Chloropernazine, Compazine, Compro, Daolin, Dhaperazine, Emedrotec, Emetiral, Eminorm, Lotamin, Mitil, Mormal, Nautisol, Novamin, Novomit, Proazine, Procalm, Prochlorperazin, Prochlorperazine, Prochlorpérazine, Prochlorperazinum, Prochlozine, Proclorperazina, Promat, Promin, Promtil, Roumin, Scripto-metic, Seratil, Stemetil, Steremal, Vergon, Vestil, and Volimin. It was also marketed at that time as a combination drug for humans with paracetamol as Vestil-A, as a combination drug for veterinary use, with isopropamide as Darbazine. == Research == Alexza Pharmaceuticals studied an inhaled form of prochlorperazine for the treatment of migraine through Phase II trials under the development name AT-001; development was discontinued in 2011. == Synthesis == The alkylation of 2-chlorophenothiazine (1) and 1-(3-Chloropropyl)-4-methylpiperazine [104-16-5] (2) in the presence of sodamide gives Prochlorperazine (3); or by alkylation of 2-Chloro-10-(3-chloropropyl)phenothiazine [2765-59-5] (4) and 1-methylpiperazine (5). == References == == External links == ""Prochlorperazine"".

189	Aripiprazole	WIKIPEDIA	"Aripiprazole, sold under the brand names Abilify and Aristada, among others, is an atypical antipsychotic. It is primarily used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder; other uses include as an add-on treatment in major depressive disorder and tic disorders. Aripiprazole is taken by mouth or via injection into a muscle. A Cochrane review found low-quality evidence of effectiveness in treating schizophrenia. Common side effects include restlessness, insomnia, transient weight gain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, and mild sedation. Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, and anaphylaxis. It is not recommended for older people with dementia-related psychosis due to an increased risk of death. In pregnancy, there is evidence of possible harm to the fetus. It is not recommended in women who are breastfeeding. It has not been very well studied in people less than 18 years old. Aripiprazole was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 106th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Aripiprazole is primarily used for the treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. === Schizophrenia === The 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for treating psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people recommended aripiprazole as a second-line treatment after risperidone for people between 15 and 17 who are having an acute exacerbation or recurrence of psychosis or schizophrenia. A 2014 NICE review of the depot formulation of the drug found that it might have a role in treatment as an alternative to other depot formulations of second-generation antipsychotics for people who have trouble taking medication as directed or who prefer it. A 2014 Cochrane review comparing aripiprazole and other atypical antipsychotics found that it is difficult to determine differences as data quality is poor. A 2011 Cochrane review comparing aripiprazole with placebo concluded that high dropout rates in clinical trials, and a lack of outcome data regarding general functioning, behavior, mortality, economic outcomes, or cognitive functioning make it difficult to definitively conclude that aripiprazole is useful for the prevention of relapse. A Cochrane review found only low-quality evidence of effectiveness in treating schizophrenia. Accordingly, part of its methodology on quality of evidence is based on the quantity of qualified studies. A 2013 review placed aripiprazole in the middle range of 15 antipsychotics for effectiveness, approximately as effective as haloperidol and quetiapine and slightly more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine, with better tolerability compared to the other antipsychotic drugs (4th best for reducing weight gain, 5th best for reducing extrapyramidal symptoms, best for reducing prolactin levels, 2nd best for prolongated QTc interval, and 5th best for sedative symptoms). The authors concluded that for acute psychotic episodes, aripiprazole results in benefits in some aspects of the condition. In 2013 the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry recommended aripiprazole for the treatment of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia as a Grade 1 recommendation and evidence level A. The British Association for Psychopharmacology similarly recommends that all persons presenting with psychosis receive treatment with an antipsychotic and that such treatment should continue for at least 1–2 years, as ""There is no doubt that antipsychotic discontinuation is strongly associated with relapse during this period"". The guideline further notes that ""Established schizophrenia requires continued maintenance with doses of antipsychotic medication within the recommended range (Evidence level A)"". The British Association for Psychopharmacology and the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry suggest that there is little difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics in the prevention of relapse, and recommend that the specific choice of antipsychotic be chosen based on each person's preference and side effect profile. The latter group recommends switching to aripiprazole when excessive weight gain is encountered during treatment with other antipsychotics. === Bipolar disorder === Aripiprazole is effective for the treatment of acute manic episodes of bipolar disorder in adults, children, and adolescents. Used as maintenance therapy, it is useful for the prevention of manic episodes but is not useful for bipolar depression. Thus, it is often used in combination with an additional mood stabilizer; however, co-administration with a mood stabilizer increases the risk of extrapyramidal side effects. In September 2014, aripiprazole had a UK marketing authorization for up to twelve weeks of treatment for moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder in young people aged thirteen and older. Aripiprazole in low doses of 2.5 mg can cause mania in those with Bipolar disorder. === Depression === Aripiprazole is an effective add-on treatment for major depressive disorder; however, there is a greater rate of side effects such as weight gain and movement disorders. The overall benefit is small to moderate and its use appears to neither improve quality of life nor functioning. Aripiprazole may interact with some antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that are metabolized by CYP2D6. There are known interactions with fluoxetine and paroxetine and it appears lesser interactions with sertraline, escitalopram, citalopram and fluvoxamine. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase aripiprazole concentrations to 2–3 times their normal level. When strong CYP2D6 SSRIs (such as fluoxetine, paroxetine) are co-administered, the FDA recommends dose monitoring, although it is not clear the SSRI dose should be lowered. === Autism === Short-term data (8 weeks) shows reduced irritability, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech, and stereotypy, but no change in lethargic behaviours. Adverse effects include weight gain, sleepiness, drooling, and tremors. It is suggested that children and adolescents need to be monitored regularly while taking this medication to evaluate if this treatment option is still effective after long-term use and note if side effects are worsening. Further studies are needed to understand if this drug is helpful for children after long-term use. === Tic disorders === Aripiprazole is approved for the treatment of Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders. It is effective, safe, and well-tolerated for this use per systematic reviews and meta-analyses. === Obsessive-compulsive disorder === A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that add-on therapy with low-dose aripiprazole is an effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that does not improve with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) alone. The conclusion was based on the results of two relatively small, short-term trials, each of which demonstrated improvements in symptoms. However, aripiprazole is cautiously recommended by a 2017 review on antipsychotics for OCD. Aripiprazole is not currently approved for the treatment of OCD and is instead used off-label for this indication. Depending on the dose, aripiprazole can increase impulse control issues in a small percentage of people. The FDA Drug Safety Communication warned about this side effect. === Available forms === Aripiprazole is available in the form of oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, oral solutions, oral films, and as injectables for intramuscular administration. It is also available in the form of aripiprazole lauroxil, a lipophilic ester prodrug of aripiprazole for use as a long-acting injectable. == Contraindications == Contraindications to aripiprazole include known hypersensitivity to aripiprazole, among others. == Adverse effects == In the elderly with dementia, there is an increased risk of death. In children, adolescents, and young adults, there is an increased risk of suicide. In adults, side effects with greater than 10% incidence include weight gain, mania, headache, akathisia, insomnia, delirium, and gastrointestinal effects like nausea, constipation, and lightheadedness. Side effects in children are similar, and include sleepiness, increased appetite, and stuffy nose. A strong desire to gamble, binge eat, shop, and engage in sexual activity may also occur rarely. These urges can be uncontrollable. Uncontrolled movement such as restlessness, tremors, and muscle rigidity may occur. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis as a part of a withdrawal syndrome. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Overdose == Children or adults who ingested acute overdoses have usually manifested central nervous system depression ranging from mild sedation to coma; serum concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole in these people were elevated by up to 3–4 fold over normal therapeutic levels; as of 2008, no deaths had been recorded. == Interactions == Aripiprazole is a substrate of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Coadministration with medications that inhibit (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine) or induce (e.g. carbamazepine) these metabolic enzymes are known to increase and decrease, respectively, plasma levels of aripiprazole. Precautions should be taken in people with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics along with other medications that affect blood sugar levels and should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. The liquid form (oral solution) of this medication may contain up to 15 grams of sugar per dose. Antipsychotics like aripiprazole and stimulant medications, such as amphetamine, are traditionally thought to have opposing effects because both drugs affect dopaminergic neurons. However, both stimulants and antipsychotics lead to increases in synaptic dopamine levels. In antipsychotics, this is caused by the inhibition of dopamine autoreceptors as well as the effects of antipsychotics on non-dopaminergic receptors, while in amphetamine this is caused by non-competitive inhibition of dopamine reuptake and agonism of intracellular TAAR1. Therefore aripiprazole may interact with amphetamine to synergistically increase postsynaptic levels of dopamine. This interaction frequently occurs in the setting of comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (for which stimulants are commonly prescribed) and off-label treatment of aggression with antipsychotics. Aripiprazole has been reported to provide some benefit in improving cognitive functioning in people with ADHD without other psychiatric comorbidities, though the results have been disputed. The combination of antipsychotics like aripiprazole with stimulants should not be considered an absolute contraindication. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Aripiprazole's mechanism of action is different from those of the other FDA-approved atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and risperidone). It shows differential engagement at the dopamine receptor (D2). Aripiprazole is a partial agonist at dopamine D2 receptors, a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, and an antagonist or very weak partial agonist and at 5-HT2A receptors. It appears to show predominantly partial agonistic activity on postsynaptic D2 receptors and partial agonist activity on presynaptic D2 receptors, D3, and partially D4 and is a partial activator of serotonin (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7). It also shows lower effect on histamine (H1), as well as the serotonin transporter. Aripiprazole acts by modulating neurotransmission overactivity of dopamine, which is thought to mitigate schizophrenia symptoms. There are studies to date confirming aripiprazole as an antagonist at alpha-adrenergic receptors such as α1A, α2A and α2C, the orthostatic hypotension observed with aripiprazole may be explained by its antagonist activity at adrenergic α1A receptors. As a pharmacologically unique antipsychotic with pronounced functional selectivity, characterization of this dopamine D2 partial agonist (with an intrinsic activity of ~50%) as being similar to a full agonist but at a reduced level of activity presents a misleading oversimplification of its actions; for example, among other effects, aripiprazole has been shown, in vitro, to bind to and/or induce receptor conformations (i.e., facilitate receptor shapes) in such a way as to not only prevent receptor internalization (and, thus, lower receptor density) but even to lower the rate of receptor internalization below that of neurons not in the presence of agonists (including dopamine) or antagonists. It is often the nature of partial agonists, including aripiprazole, to display a stabilizing effect (such as on mood in this case) with agonistic activity when there are low levels of endogenous neurotransmitters (such as dopamine) and antagonistic activity in the presence of high levels of agonists associated with events such as mania, psychosis, and drug use. In addition to aripiprazole's partial agonism and functional selectivity characteristics, its effectiveness may be mediated by its very high dopamine D2 receptor occupancy (approximately 31%, 44%, 75%, 80%, and 95% at daily dosages of 0.5 mg, 2 mg, 10 mg, 30mg and 40 mg respectively) Aripiprazole has been characterized as possessing predominantly partial agonist activity on postsynaptic D2 receptors and partial agonist activity on presynaptic D2 receptors; however, while this explanation intuitively explains the drug's efficacy as an antipsychotic, as the degree of agonism is a function of more than a drug's inherent properties as well as in vitro demonstration of aripiprazole's partial agonism in cells expressing postsynaptic (D2L) receptors, it was noted that ""It is unlikely that the differential actions of aripiprazole as an agonist, antagonist, or partial agonist were entirely due to differences in relative D2 receptor expression since aripiprazole was an antagonist in cells with the highest level of expression (4.6 pmol/mg) and a partial agonist in cells with an intermediate level of expression (0.5–1 pmol/mg). Instead, the current data are most parsimoniously explained by the ""functional selectivity"" hypothesis of Lawler et al. (1999)"". Aripiprazole is also a partial agonist of the D3 receptor. In healthy human volunteers, D2 and D3 receptor occupancy levels are high, with average levels ranging between approximately 75% at 2 mg/day to approximately 95% at 40 mg/day. Most atypical antipsychotics bind preferentially to extrastriatal receptors, but aripiprazole appears to be less preferential in this regard, as binding rates are high throughout the brain. Aripiprazole is also a partial agonist of the postsynaptic serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (intrinsic activity = 68%). a PET scan study of 12 patients receiving doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg found 5-HT1A receptor occupancy to be only 16% compared to ~90% for D2. It is a very weak partial agonist of the Postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor (intrinsic activity = 12.7%). The drug differs from other atypical antipsychotics in having higher affinity for the D2 receptor than for the 5-HT2A receptor. At the 5-HT2B receptor, aripiprazole has both great binding affinity and acts as a potent inverse agonist, ""Aripiprazole decreased PI hydrolysis from a basal level of 61% down to a low of 30% at 1000 nM, with an EC50 of 11 nM"". Unlike other antipsychotics, aripiprazole is a high-efficacy partial agonist of the postsynaptic 5-HT2C receptor (intrinsic activity = 82%) this property may underlie the minimal weight gain seen in the course of therapy, however if used while taking antidepressants it will become a functional antagonist and increase weight gain. At the presynaptic 5-HT7 receptor, aripiprazole is a very weak partial agonist with barely measurable intrinsic activity, and hence is a functional antagonist of this receptor. Aripiprazole also shows lower but likely clinically insignificant affinity for a number of other sites such as the serotonin transporter, while it has negligible affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors Since the actions of aripiprazole differ markedly across receptor systems aripiprazole was sometimes an antagonist (e.g., at 5-HT6), sometimes an inverse agonist (e.g., 5-HT2B), sometimes a partial agonist (e.g., D2S, D3S, D4S, D2L). Aripiprazole was frequently found to be a partial agonist or full agonist, with an intrinsic activity that could be low (5-HT2A, 5-HT7), intermediate (D2L, 5-HT1A), or high (5-HT2C). This mixture of agonist actions at D2-dopamine receptors is consistent with the hypothesis that aripiprazole has ""functionally selective"" actions. The ""functional-selectivity"" hypothesis proposes that a mixture of agonist/partial agonist/antagonist actions are likely. According to this hypothesis, agonists may induce structural changes in receptor conformations that are differentially ""sensed"" by the local complement of G proteins to induce a variety of functional actions depending upon the precise cellular milieu. The diverse actions of aripiprazole at D2-dopamine receptors are clearly cell-type specific (e.g., agonism, antagonism, partial agonism), and are most parsimoniously explained by the ""functional selectivity"" hypothesis. Since 5-HT2C receptors have been implicated in the control of depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and appetite, postsynaptic partial agonism at the 5-HT2C receptor might be associated with therapeutic potential in obsessive-compulsive disorder, obesity, and depression. 5-HT2C agonism has been demonstrated to induce anorexia via enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission via activation of postsynaptic 5-HT2C receptors; it is conceivable that the 5-HT2C partial agonist actions of aripiprazole may, thus, be partly responsible for the minimal weight gain associated with this compound in clinical trials. In terms of potential action as an antiobsessional agent, it is worthwhile noting that a variety of 5-HT2A/5-HT2C agonists have shown promise as antiobsessional agents, yet many of these compounds are hallucinogenic. Aripiprazole has a favorable pharmacological profile in being a 5-HT2C partial agonist. Based on this profile, one can predict that aripiprazole may have antiobsessional and anorectic actions in humans. Wood and Reavill's (2007) review of published and unpublished data proposed that, at therapeutically relevant doses, aripiprazole may act essentially as a selective partial agonist of the D2 receptor without significantly affecting the majority of serotonin receptors. A positron emission tomography imaging study found that 10 to 30 mg/day aripiprazole resulted in 85 to 95% occupancy of the D2 receptor in various brain areas (putamen, caudate, ventral striatum) versus 54 to 60% occupancy of the 5-HT2A receptor and only 16% occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor. It has been suggested that the low occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor by aripiprazole may have been an erroneous measurement however. Aripiprazole acts by modulating neurotransmission overactivity on the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, which is thought to be a cause of positive schizophrenia symptoms. Due to its partial agonist activity on D2L receptors, aripiprazole may also increase dopaminergic activity to optimal levels in the mesocortical pathways where it is reduced. === Pharmacokinetics === Aripiprazole displays linear kinetics and has an elimination half-life of approximately 75 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved in about 14 days. Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) is achieved 3–5 hours after oral dosing. Bioavailability of the oral tablets is about 90% and the drug undergoes extensive hepatic metabolization (dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation), principally by the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Its only known active metabolite is dehydro-aripiprazole, which typically accumulates to approximately 40% of the aripiprazole concentration. The parenteral drug is excreted only in traces, and its metabolites, active or not, are excreted via feces and urine. == Chemistry == Aripiprazole belongs to the chemical class of drugs called 2,3-dichlorophenylpiperazines and is chemically related to cariprazine, nefazodone, etoperidone, and trazodone. It is unusual in having twelve known crystalline polymorphs. == History == Aripiprazole was discovered in 1988 by scientists at the Japanese firm Otsuka Pharmaceutical and was called OPC-14597. It was first published in 1995. Otsuka initially developed the drug, and partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) in 1999 to complete development, obtain approvals, and market aripiprazole. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for schizophrenia in November 2002, and by the European Medicines Agency in June 2004; for acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder on 1 October 2004; as an adjunct for major depressive disorder on 20 November 2007; and to treat irritability in children with autism on 20 November 2009. Likewise it was approved for use as a treatment for schizophrenia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia in May 2003. Aripiprazole has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of both acute manic and mixed episodes, in people older than ten years. In 2006, the FDA required manufacturers to add a black box warning to the label, warning that older people who were given the drug for dementia-related psychosis were at greater risk of death. In 2007, aripiprazole was approved by the FDA for the treatment of unipolar depression when used adjunctively with an antidepressant medication. That same year, BMS settled a case with the US government in which it paid $515 million; the case covered several drugs but the focus was on BMS's off-label marketing of aripiprazole for children and older people with dementia. In 2011 Otsuka and Lundbeck signed a collaboration to develop a depot formulation of aripiprazole. As of 2013, Abilify had annual sales of US$7 billion. In 2013 BMS returned marketing rights to Otsuka, but kept manufacturing the drug. Also in 2013, Otsuka and Lundbeck received US and European marketing approval for an injectable depot formulation of aripiprazole. Otsuka's US patent on aripiprazole expired on 20 October 2014, but due to a pediatric extension, a generic did not become available until 20 April 2015. Barr Laboratories (now Teva Pharmaceuticals) initiated a patent challenge under the Hatch-Waxman Act in March 2007. On 15 November 2010, this challenge was rejected by the U.S. District Court in New Jersey. Otsuka's European patent EP0367141 which would have expired on 26 October 2009, was extended by a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) to 26 October 2014., The UK Intellectual Property Office decided on 4 March 2015 that the SPC could not be further extended by six months under Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. Even if the decision is successfully appealed, protection in Europe will not extend beyond 26 April 2015. From April 2013 to March 2014, sales of Abilify amounted to almost $6.9 billion. In April 2015, the FDA announced the first generic versions. In October 2015, aripiprazole lauroxil, a prodrug of aripiprazole that is administered via intramuscular injection once every four to six weeks for the treatment of schizophrenia, was approved by the FDA. In 2016, BMS settled cases with 42 US states that had charged BMS with off-label marketing to older people with dementia; BMS agreed to pay $19.5 million. In November 2017, the FDA approved Abilify MyCite, a digital pill containing a sensor intended to record when its consumer takes their medication. A long-acting injectable version of aripiprazole was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar disorder 1 and schizophrenia in April 2023. In 2024, the European Commission approved the long-acting injectable formulation of aripiprazole for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. == Society and culture == === Legal status === === Classification === Aripiprazole has been described as the prototypical third-generation antipsychotic, as opposed to first-generation (typical) antipsychotics like haloperidol and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics like clozapine. It has received this classification due to its partial agonism of dopamine receptors, and is the first of its kind in this regard among antipsychotics, which before aripiprazole acted only as dopamine receptor antagonists. The introduction of aripiprazole has led to a paradigm shift from a dopamine antagonist-based approach to a dopamine agonist-based approach for antipsychotic drug development. === Brand names === Brand names of aripiprazole include Abilify, Aristada (as aripiprazole lauroxil), Arip MT, Explemed, and Arivitae, among numerous others. == Research == === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder === Aripiprazole was under development for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but development for this indication was discontinued. A 2017 meta review found only preliminary evidence (studies with small sample sizes and methodological problems) for aripiprazole in the treatment of ADHD. A 2013 systematic review of aripiprazole for ADHD similarly reported that there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness to support aripiprazole as a treatment for the condition. Although all 6 non-controlled open-label studies in the review reported effectiveness, two small randomized controlled trials found that aripiprazole did not significantly decrease ADHD symptoms. A high rate of adverse effects with aripiprazole such as weight gain, sedation, and headache was noted. Most research on aripiprazole for ADHD is in children and adolescents. Evidence on aripiprazole specifically for adult ADHD appears to be limited to a single case report. === Substance dependence === Aripiprazole has been studied for the treatment of amphetamine dependence and other substance use disorders, but more research is needed to support aripiprazole for these potential uses. Available evidence of aripiprazole for amphetamine dependence is mixed. Some studies have reported attenuation of the effects of amphetamines by aripiprazole, whereas other studies have reported both enhancement of the effects of amphetamines and increased use of amphetamines by aripiprazole. As such, aripiprazole may not only be ineffective but potentially harmful for treatment of amphetamine dependence, and caution is warranted with regard to its use for such purposes. === Other uses === As of May 2021, aripiprazole is in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of agitation and pervasive child development disorders. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Mechanism of Action of Aripiprazole"".

190	Desloratadine	WIKIPEDIA	Desloratadine sold under the brand name Clarinex among others, is a tricyclic H1 inverse agonist that is used to treat allergies. It is an active metabolite of loratadine. It was patented in 1984 and came into medical use in 2001. It was brought to the market in the US by Schering Corporation, later named Schering-Plough. == Medical uses == Desloratadine is used to treat allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives). It is the major metabolite of loratadine and the two drugs are similar in safety and effectiveness. Desloratadine is available in many dosage forms and under many brand names worldwide. An emerging indication for desloratadine is in the treatment of acne, as an inexpensive adjuvant to isotretinoin and possibly as maintenance therapy or monotherapy. == Side effects == The most common side-effects are fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (3%), and headache (0.6%). == Interactions == Co-administration with erythromycin, ketoconazole, azithromycin, fluoxetine, or cimetidine resulted in elevated blood plasma concentrations of desloratadine and its metabolite 3-hydroxydesloratadine in studies. However, no clinically relevant changes were observed. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Desloratadine is a selective H1-antihistamine which functions as an inverse agonist at the histamine H1 receptor. At very high doses, is also an antagonist at various subtypes of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. This effect is not relevant for the drug's action at therapeutic doses. === Pharmacokinetics === Desloratadine is well absorbed from the gut and reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after about three hours. In the bloodstream, 83 to 87% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. Desloratadine is metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine in a three-step sequence in normal metabolizers. First, N-glucuronidation of desloratadine by UGT2B10; then, 3-hydroxylation of desloratadine N-glucuronide by CYP2C8; and finally, a non-enzymatic deconjugation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine N-glucuronide. Both desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are eliminated via urine and feces with a half-life of 27 hours in normal metabolizers. It exhibits only peripheral activity since it does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier; hence, it does not normally cause drowsiness because it does not readily enter the central nervous system. Desloratadine does not have a strong effect on a number of tested enzymes in the cytochrome P450 system. It was found to weakly inhibit CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/CYP3A5, and not to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19. Desloratadine was found to be a potent and relatively selective inhibitor of UGT2B10, a weak to moderate inhibitor of UGT2B17, UGT1A10, and UGT2B4, and not to inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, UGT2B15, UGT1A7, and UGT1A8. === Pharmacogenomics === 2% of Caucasian people and 18% of people from African descent are desloratadine poor metabolizers. In these people, the drug reaches threefold higher plasma concentrations at seven hours after intake, and it has a half-life of 89 hours (compared to a 27-hour half-life in normal metabolizers). Adverse effects were reported at similar rates in poor metabolizers, suggesting that it is not clinically relevant. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
191	Lamotrigine	WIKIPEDIA	"Lamotrigine, sold under the brand name Lamictal among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy and stabilize mood in bipolar disorder. For epilepsy, this includes focal seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In bipolar disorder, lamotrigine has not been shown to reliably treat acute depression in any groups except for the severely depressed; but for patients with bipolar disorder who are not currently symptomatic, it appears to reduce the risk of future episodes of depression. Common side effects include nausea, sleepiness, headache, vomiting, trouble with coordination, and rash. Serious side effects include excessive breakdown of red blood cells, increased risk of suicide, severe skin reaction (Stevens–Johnson syndrome), and allergic reactions, which can be fatal. Lamotrigine is a phenyltriazine, making it chemically different from other anticonvulsants. Its mechanism of action is not clear, but it appears to inhibit release of excitatory neurotransmitters via voltage-sensitive sodium channels and voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons. Lamotrigine was first marketed in Ireland in 1991, and approved for use in the United States in 1994. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 58th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 11 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Epilepsy === Lamotrigine is considered a first-line drug for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (includes simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures such as focal-onset tonic-clonic seizures). It is also used as an alternative or adjuvant medication for partial seizures, such as absence seizure, myoclonic seizure, and atonic seizures. The evidence supporting the use of lamotrigine as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant generalized tonic-clonic seizures is not clear enough to inform clinical practice. Although low-certainty evidence suggests that it reduces generalized tonic-clonic seizures by 50% the level of uncertainty indicates that the actual findings could be significantly different. Evidence supporting the use of lamotrigine as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy found that it is likely effective for reducing seizure frequency and is generally well tolerated. Lamotrigine has some side effects including a risk of dizziness, nausea, ataxia, or visual disturbances such as diplopia. The long-term effects of lamotrigine have not been investigated. ==== Lennox–Gastaut syndrome ==== Lamotrigine is one of a small number of FDA-approved therapies for the form of epilepsy known as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. It reduces the frequency of LGS seizures, and is one of two medications known to decrease the severity of drop attacks. Combination with valproate is common, but this increases the risk of lamotrigine-induced severe skin reaction Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and necessitates reduced dosing due to the interaction of these drugs. === Bipolar disorder === Lamotrigine is approved in the US for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. While the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are predominantly antimanics, lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy only in preventing or reducing the risk of recurrent depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. The drug seems ineffective in the treatment of current rapid-cycling, acute mania, or acute depression in bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine has been shown to be as effective as lithium, the standard treatment for bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine has not demonstrated clear efficacy in treating acute mood episodes, either mania or depression. It has not demonstrated effectiveness in treating acute mania, and there is controversy regarding the drug's effectiveness in treating acute bipolar depression. A paper written in 2008 by Nassir et al. reviewed evidence from trials that were unpublished and not referenced in the 2002 APA guidelines, and it concludes that lamotrigine has ""very limited, if any, efficacy in the treatment of acute bipolar depression"". A 2008 paper by Calabrese et al. examined much of the same data, and found that in five placebo-controlled studies, lamotrigine did not significantly differ from placebo in the treatment of bipolar depression. However, in a meta-analysis of these studies conducted in 2008, Geddes, Calabrese, and Goodwin found that lamotrigine was effective in individuals with bipolar depression, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 11, or 7 in severe depression. A 2013 review concluded that lamotrigine is recommended in bipolar maintenance when depression is prominent and that more research is needed regarding its role in the treatment of acute bipolar depression and unipolar depression. No information to recommend its use in other psychiatric disorders was found. === Schizophrenia === Lamotrigine, as a monotherapy, is not substantially effective against schizophrenia. However, various publications and textbooks have expressed that lamotrigine could be added to clozapine as augmentation therapy against partial or non-responding patients with schizophrenia. Patients had statistically significant improvements in positive, negative and affective symptoms. Lamotrigine does not have a statistically significant effect with antipsychotics other than clozapine, such as: olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, zuclopenthixol, etc. === Other uses === Off-label uses include the treatment of peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headaches, migraines, visual snow, and reducing neuropathic pain, although a systematic review conducted in 2013 concluded that well-designed clinical trials have shown no benefit for lamotrigine in neuropathic pain. Off-label psychiatric usage includes the treatment of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, depersonalization derealization disorder, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and borderline personality disorder. It has not been shown to be useful in post-traumatic stress disorder. GlaxoSmithKline investigated lamotrigine for the treatment of ADHD with inconclusive results. No detrimental effects on cognitive function were observed; however, the only statistical improvement in core ADHD symptoms was an improvement on a Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test that measures auditory processing speed and calculation ability. Another study reported that lamotrigine might be a safe and effective treatment option for adult ADHD comorbid with bipolar and recurrent depression. == Side effects == Side effects such as rash, fever, and fatigue are very serious, as they may indicate incipient SJS, TEN, DRESS syndrome, or aseptic meningitis. Lamotrigine prescribing information has a black box warning about life-threatening skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), DRESS syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The manufacturer states that nearly all cases appear in the first two to eight weeks of therapy. Patients should seek medical attention for any unexpected skin rash, as its presence is an indication of a possible serious or even deadly side effect of the drug. Not all rashes that occur while taking lamotrigine progress to SJS or TEN. Between 5 and 10% of patients will develop a rash, but only one in a thousand patients will develop a serious rash. Rash and other skin reactions are more common in children, so this medication is often reserved for adults. For patients whose lamotrigine has been stopped after the development of a rash, rechallenge with lamotrigine is also a viable option. Usually, rechallenge is done by reinstating lamotrigine at a smaller dose (5mg/day). However, it does not apply to very serious cases. The incidence of these eruptions increases in patients who are currently on, or recently discontinued a valproate-type anticonvulsant drug, as these medications interact in such a way that the clearance of both is decreased and the effective dose of lamotrigine is increased. In 2018, the FDA required a new warning for the risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This serious reaction can occur between days to weeks after starting the treatment. Other side effects include alopecia (hair loss), loss of balance or coordination, double vision, crossed eyes, pupil constriction, blurred vision, dizziness and lack of coordination, drowsiness, insomnia, anxiety, vivid dreams or nightmares, dry mouth, mouth ulcers, memory problems, mood changes, itchiness, runny nose, cough, nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, weight loss, missed or painful menstrual periods, and vaginitis. The side-effects profile varies for different patient populations. Overall adverse effects in treatment are similar between men, women, geriatric, pediatric, and racial groups. Lamotrigine has been associated with a decrease in white blood cell count (leukopenia). Lamotrigine does not prolong QT/QTc in TQT studies in healthy subjects. In people taking antipsychotics, cases of lamotrigine-precipitated neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported. === Women === Women are more likely than men to have side effects. Some evidence shows interactions between lamotrigine and female hormones, which can be of particular concern for women on estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives. Ethinylestradiol, an ingredient of such contraceptives, has been shown to decrease serum levels of lamotrigine. Women starting an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive may need to increase the dosage of lamotrigine to maintain its level of efficacy. Likewise, women may experience an increase in lamotrigine side effects upon discontinuation of birth control pills. This may include the ""pill-free"" week where lamotrigine serum levels have been shown to increase twofold. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Many studies have found no association between lamotrigine exposure in utero and birth defects, while those that have found an association have found only slight associations with minor malformations such as cleft palates. Review studies have found that overall rates of congenital malformations in infants exposed to lamotrigine in utero are relatively low (1–4%), which is similar to the rate of malformations in the general population. It is known that lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and other, more powerful, human DHFR inhibitors such as methotrexate are known to be teratogenic. Lamotrigine is expressed in breast milk; the manufacturer recommends carefully weighing the benefits and risks of taking lamotrigine while breastfeeding. However, some studies suggest that lamotrigine is safe to use while breastfeeding. A frequently updated review of scientific literature rates lamotrigine as L3: moderately safe. === Other types of effects === Lamotrigine binds to melanin-containing tissues such as the iris of the eye or melanin-rich skin. The long-term consequences of this are unknown. Lamotrigine is known to affect sleep. Studies with small numbers of patients (10–15) reported that lamotrigine increases the duration of REM sleep, decreases the number of phase shifts, and decreases the duration of slow-wave sleep, and that there was no effect on vigilance, daytime somnolence and cognitive function. However, a retrospective study of 109 patients' medical records found that 6.7% of patients experienced an ""alerting effect"" resulting in intolerable insomnia, for which the treatment had to be discontinued. Lamotrigine can induce a type of seizure known as a myoclonic jerk, which tends to happen soon after the use of the medication. When used in the treatment of myoclonic epilepsies such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, lower doses (and lower plasma levels) are usually needed, as even moderate doses of this drug can induce seizures, including tonic-clonic seizures, which can develop into status epilepticus, which is a medical emergency. It can also cause myoclonic status epilepticus. In overdose, lamotrigine can cause uncontrolled seizures in most people. Reported results in overdoses involving up to 15 g include increased seizures, coma, and death. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Lamotrigine is a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs. This may suppress the release of glutamate and aspartate, two dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. It is generally accepted to be a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs, but it could have additional actions, since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel-blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its sigma receptor activity. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasizes its unique properties. It is a triazine derivate that inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, leading to stabilization of neuronal membranes. It also blocks L-, N-, and P-type calcium channels and weakly inhibits the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. These actions are thought to inhibit release of glutamate at cortical projections in the ventral striatum limbic areas, and its neuroprotective and antiglutamatergic effects have been pointed out as promising contributors to its mood stabilizing activity. Observations that lamotrigine reduced GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in rat amygdala suggest that a GABAergic mechanism may also be involved. It appears that lamotrigine does not increase GABA blood levels in humans. Lamotrigine does not have pronounced effects on any of the usual neurotransmitter receptors that anticonvulsants affect (adrenergic, dopamine D1 and D2, muscarinic, GABA, histaminergic H1, serotonin 5-HT2, and N-methyl-D-aspartate). Inhibitory effects on 5-HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters are weak. Lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, but whether this effect is sufficient to contribute to a mechanism of action or increases risk to the fetus during pregnancy is not known. Early studies of lamotrigine's mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex slices in vitro. As is the case for antiepileptic drugs that act on voltage-dependent sodium channels, lamotrigine thereby inhibits the release of glutamate and aspartate, which is evoked by the sodium-channel activator veratrine and was less effective in the inhibition of acetylcholine or GABA release. At high concentrations, it did not affect spontaneous or potassium-evoked amino acid release. These studies suggested that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several electrophysiological studies have investigated the effects of lamotrigine on voltage-gated sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant in the treatment of human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These and a variety of other results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognized to be protective against generalized absence epilepsy and other generalized epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The basis for this broader spectrum of activity of lamotrigine is unknown but could relate to actions of the drug on voltage-gated calcium channels. Lamotrigine blocks T-type calcium channels weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high voltage-gated calcium channels (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on calcium channels accounts for lamotrigine's broader clinical spectrum of activity in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined. It antagonizes these receptors with the following IC50 values: 5-HT3, IC50 = 18 μM σ receptors, IC50 = 145 μM === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine follow first-order kinetics, with a half-life of 29 hours and volume of distribution of 1.36 L/kg. Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Its absolute bioavailability is 98% and its plasma Cmax occurs from 1.4 to 4.8 hours. Available data indicate that its bioavailability is not affected by food. Estimate of the mean apparent volume of distribution of lamotrigine following oral administration ranges from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. This is independent of dose and is similar to following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers. Lamotrigine is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver. Lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation. Its major metabolite is an inactive 2-n-glucuronide conjugate. Lamotrigine has fewer drug interactions than many anticonvulsant drugs, although pharmacokinetic interactions with carbamazepine, phenytoin and other hepatic enzyme-inducing medications may shorten half-life. Dose adjustments should be made on clinical response, but monitoring may be of benefit in assessing compliance. The capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences of melanin binding is unknown. Clinical trials excluded subtle effects and optimal duration of treatment. There are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring. Lamotrigine binds to the eye and melanin-containing tissues which can accumulate over time and may cause toxicity. Prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects and base treatment on clinical response. Patient compliance should be periodically reassessed with lab and medical testing of liver and kidney function to monitor progress or side effects. == Chemistry == The first synthesis of lamotrigine was disclosed in a patent file by the Wellcome Foundation in 1980. 2,3-Dichlorobenzoyl chloride is treated with cuprous cyanide to form an acyl cyanide. This is then reacted with the nitrate salt of aminoguanidine to give an intermediate which is cyclised to the diamino triazine of the drug product. == History == 1980 — initial patent filings are made by the Wellcome Foundation. 1990 — lamotrigine is approved for use in Ireland to treat epilepsy. 1991 — lamotrigine is used in the United Kingdom as an anticonvulsant medication December 1994 — lamotrigine was approved for use in the United States for the treatment of partial seizures. August 1998 — for use as adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in pediatric and adult patients, new dosage form: chewable dispersible tablets. December 1998 — for use as monotherapy for the treatment of partial seizures in adult patients when converting from a single enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug. January 2003 — for use as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in pediatric patients as young as two years of age. June 2003 — approved for maintenance treatment of bipolar II disorder; the first such medication since lithium. January 2004 — for use as monotherapy for the treatment of partial seizures in adult patients when converting from the anti-epileptic drug valproate (including valproic acid) == Society and culture == === Brand names === Lamotrigine is sold under the original brand name Lamictal and it is available in generic form under many brand names worldwide. == Regulatory advisory in 2021 == In March 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding the potential for cardiac arrhythmias in people with pre-existing structural or conduction heart defects. The warning provoked consternation and controversy within the professional community. An in-vitro study conducted in 2011 predicted Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutic concentrations of lamotrigine, due to its sodium channel-blocking activity. Thus, lamotrigine use in at-risk populations could prolong the QRS interval on the electrocardiogram, and increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death. No references to human studies or postmarket data in at-risk populations (i.e., people with structural heart disease) were cited to support the warning. A study in dogs is mentioned in the prescribing information brochure by the manufacturer. A rapid systematic review concluded that ""there is insufficient evidence to support or refute that lamotrigine is associated with sudden death or electrocardiogram changes..."" The FDA has recommended that further studies are conducted with lamotrigine and other sodium-channel blocking antiseizure medications. In March 2023, an FDA Adverse Event Reporting System analysis demonstrated signals of cardiac arrest, but not of tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia nor their clinical manifestation as fainting in lamotrigine. The study stratified the epileptic and psychiatric indications, explaining that the nature of the signal for cardiac arrest seems to be confounded by the psychiatric indication, which included 2.5 times more concomitant medications with cardiac adverse events, such as QT-prolonging drugs. Additionally, a 1.5-fold greater reports on overdose and suicide attempts was recorded in the psychiatric reports. Although lamotrigine blocks the cardiac sodium channels at therapeutically relevant concentrations, owing to its short-fast kinetics at the channel level, this blockage did not translate into a disproportional signal in this study. == Research == Though lamotrigine has been used to treat seizures in infants, as of 2023, its effectiveness in this age group has been evaluated in only one study. Adverse effects were rarely severe enough for the medication to be discontinued in this age group, however, its effectiveness in reducing seizures was inconclusive. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -5.5122365e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
193	Loratadine	WIKIPEDIA	"Loratadine, sold under the brand name Claritin among others, is a medication used to treat allergies. This includes allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and hives. It is also available in drug combinations such as loratadine/pseudoephedrine, in which it is combined with pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant. It is taken orally. Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, and headache. Serious side effects are rare and include allergic reactions, seizures, and liver problems. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe but has not been well studied. It is not recommended in children less than two years old. It is in the second-generation antihistamine family of medication. Loratadine was patented in 1980 and came to market in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Loratadine is available as a generic medication. In the United States, it is available over the counter. In 2022, it was the 72nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9 million prescriptions. In 2022, the combination with pseudoephedrine was the 289th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Loratadine is indicated for the symptomatic relief of allergies such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis), urticaria (hives), chronic idiopathic urticaria, and other skin allergies. For allergic rhinitis, loratadine is indicated for both nasal and eye symptoms including sneezing, runny nose, and itchy or burning eyes. Similarly to cetirizine, loratadine attenuates the itching associated with Kimura's disease. === Combination drugs === Loratadine/pseudoephedrine is a fixed dose combination of the drug with pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant. === Dosage forms === The medication is available in many different forms, including tablets, oral suspension, and syrups. Also available are quick-dissolving tablets. == Contraindications == Loratadine is usually compatible with breastfeeding (classified category L-2 - probably compatible, by the American Academy of Pediatrics). In the U.S., it is classified as category B in pregnancy, meaning animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, but no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have been conducted. == Adverse effects == As a ""non-sedating"" antihistamine, loratadine causes less (but still significant, in some cases) sedation and psychomotor retardation than the older antihistamines, because it penetrates the blood/brain barrier less. Headache is also a possible side effect. Unlike earlier-generation antihistamines, loratadine is considered largely free of antimuscarinic effects (urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision). == Interactions == Substances that act as inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, cimetidine, and furanocoumarin derivatives (found in grapefruit) lead to increased plasma levels of loratadine — that is, more of the drug was present in the bloodstream than typical for a dose. This had clinically significant effects in controlled trials of 10 mg loratadine treatment. Antihistamines should be discontinued 48 hours before skin allergy tests, since these drugs may prevent or diminish otherwise positive reactions to dermal activity indicators. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Loratadine is a tricyclic antihistamine, which acts as a selective inverse agonist of peripheral histamine H1 receptors. The potency of second generation histamine antagonists is (from strongest to weakest) desloratadine (Ki 0.4 nM) > levocetirizine (Ki 3 nM) > cetirizine (Ki 6 nM) > fexofenadine (Ki 10 nM) > terfenadine > loratadine. However, the onset of action varies significantly and clinical efficacy is not always directly related to only the H1 receptor potency, as the concentration of free drug at the receptor must also be considered. Loratadine also shows anti-inflammatory properties independent of H1 receptors. The effect is exhibited through suppression of the NF-κB pathway, and by regulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, thereby regulating the recruitment of inflammatory cells. === Pharmacokinetics === Loratadine is given orally, is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and has rapid first-pass hepatic metabolism; it is metabolized by isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and, to a lesser extent, several others. Loratadine is almost totally (97–99%) bound to plasma proteins. Its metabolite desloratadine, which is largely responsible for the antihistaminergic effects, binds to plasma proteins by 73–76%. Loratadine's peak effect occurs after 1–2 hours, and its biological half life is on average eight hours (range 3 to 20 hours) with desloratadine's half-life being 27 hours (range 9 to 92 hours), accounting for its long-lasting effect. About 40% is excreted as conjugated metabolites into the urine, and a similar amount is excreted into the feces. Traces of unmetabolised loratadine can be found in the urine. In structure, it is closely related to tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine, and is distantly related to the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine. == History == Schering-Plough developed loratadine as part of a quest for a potential blockbuster drug: a nonsedating antihistamine. By the time Schering submitted the drug to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval, the agency had already approved a competitor's nonsedating antihistamine, terfenadine (trade name Seldane), and, therefore, put loratadine on a lower priority. However, terfenadine had to be removed from the U.S. market by the manufacturer in late 1997 after reports of serious ventricular arrhythmias among those taking the drug. Loratadine was approved by the FDA in 1993. The drug continued to be available only by prescription in the U.S. until it went off patent in 2002. It was then subsequently approved for over-the-counter sales. Once it became an unpatented over-the-counter drug, the price dropped significantly. Schering also developed desloratadine (Clarinex/Aerius), which is an active metabolite of loratadine. == Society and culture == === Over the counter === In 1998, in an unprecedented action in the United States, an American insurance company, Anthem Inc., petitioned the federal Food and Drug Administration to allow loratadine and two other antihistamines to be made available over the counter (OTC) while they were still protected by patents; the administration granted the request, which was not binding on manufacturers. In the United States, Schering-Plough made loratadine available over the counter in 2002. By 2015, loratadine was available over the counter in many countries. === Brands === In 2017, loratadine was available under many brand names and in many forms worldwide, including several combination drug formulations with pseudoephedrine, paracetamol, betamethasone, ambroxol, salbutamol, phenylephrine, and dexamethasone. === Marketing === The marketing of the Claritin brand is important in the history of direct-to-consumer advertising of drugs. The first television commercial for a prescription drug was broadcast in the United States in 1983, by Boots. It caused controversy. The federal Food and Drug Administration responded with strong regulations requiring disclosure of side effects and other information. These rules made pharmaceutical manufacturers balk at spending money on ads that had to highlight negative aspects. In the mid-1990s, the marketing team for Claritin at Schering-Plough found a way around these rules. They created brand awareness commercials that never actually said what the drug was for, but instead showed sunny images, and the voiceover said such things as ""At last, a clear day is here"" and ""It's time for Claritin"" and repeatedly told viewers ""Ask your doctor [about Claritin]."" The first ads made people aware of the brand and increased prescriptions, which led Schering-Plough and others to aggressively pursue the advertising strategy. In 1998, a 12-page one-shot comic based on the Batman: The Animated Series was given away to advertise Claritin. The book, written by PRIEST, penciled by Joe Staton, and inked by Mike DeCarlo, sees Tim Drake unable to perform his crime-fighting duties because hay fever and antihistamines make him drowsy. After being given a prescription for Claritin, he saved Batman from Poison Ivy. This trend, along with advice from the Food and Drug Administration's attorneys that it could not win a First Amendment case on the issue, prompted the administration to issue new rules for television commercials in 1997. Instead of including the ""brief summary"" that took up a full page in magazine ads and would take too long to explain in a short television advertisement, drug makers were allowed to refer viewers to print ads, informative telephone lines, and websites, and to urge people to talk to their doctors if they wanted additional information. Schering-Plough invested US$322 million in Claritin direct-to-consumer advertising in 1998 and 1999, far more than any other brand. Spending on direct-to-consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry rose from US$360 million in 1995 to US$1.3 billion in 1998, and by 2006, was US$5 billion. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
194	Enalapril	WIKIPEDIA	"Enalapril, sold under the brand name Vasotec among others, is an ACE inhibitor medication used to treat high blood pressure, diabetic kidney disease, and heart failure. For heart failure, it is generally used with a diuretic, such as furosemide. It is given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Onset of effects are typically within an hour when taken by mouth and last for up to a day. Common side effects include headache, tiredness, feeling lightheaded with standing, and cough. Serious side effects include angioedema and low blood pressure. Use during pregnancy is believed to result in harm to the baby. It is in the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor family of medications. Enalapril was patented in 1978, and came into medical use in 1984. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 141st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medicine. == Medical uses == Enalapril is used to treat hypertension, symptomatic heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. ACE-inhibitors (including enalapril) have demonstrated ability to reduce the progression and worsening of existing chronic kidney disease in the presence of proteinuria/microalbuminuria (protein in the urine, a biomarker for chronic kidney disease). This renal protective effect is not seen in the absence of proteinuria/microalbuminuria, including in diabetic populations. The benefit has been particularly demonstrated in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes, and is likely to be seen in other populations (although further studies and subgroup analyses of existing studies are needed) It is widely used in chronic kidney failure. Furthermore, enalapril is an emerging treatment for psychogenic polydipsia. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that when used for this purpose, enalapril led to decreased water consumption (determined by urine output and osmolality) in 60% of patients. == Side effects == The most common side effects of enalapril include increased serum creatinine (20%), dizziness (2–8%), low blood pressure (1–7%), syncope (2%), and dry cough (1–2%). The most serious common adverse event is angioedema (swelling) (0.68%) which often affects the face and lips, endangering the patient's airway. Angioedema can occur at any point during treatment with enalapril, but is most common after the first few doses. Angioedema and fatality therefrom are reportedly higher among black people. Agranulocytosis has been observed with Enalapril. Some evidence suggests enalapril will cause injury and death to a developing fetus. In pregnancy, enalapril may result in damage to the fetus's kidneys and resulting oligohydramnios (not enough amniotic fluid). Enalapril is secreted in breast milk and is not recommended for use while breastfeeding. == Mechanism of action == Normally, angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II constricts blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. Enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, inhibits ACE. Inhibition of ACE decreases levels of angiotensin II, leading to less vasoconstriction and decreased blood pressure. == Pharmacokinetics == Pharmacokinetic data of enalapril: Onset of action: about 1 hour Peak effect: 4–6 hours Duration: 12–24 hours Absorption: ~60% Metabolism: prodrug, undergoes biotransformation to enalaprilat == Structure activity relationship == Enalapril has an L-proline moiety as a part of the molecule which is responsible for the oral bioavailability of the drug. It is a pro-drug, which means that it exerts its function after being metabolized. The ""-OCH2CH3"" part of the molecule will split during the metabolism and at the carbon will be a carboxylate, which then interacts with the Zn+2 site of the ACE enzyme. This structural feature and mechanism of metabolism that must occur before the drug can inhibit the enzyme explains why it has a greater duration of action than another similar drug used for the same indication, Captopril. Duration of effect is dose-related; at recommended doses, antihypertensive and haemodynamic effects have been shown to be maintained for at least 24 hours. Enalapril has a slower onset of action than Captopril but a greater duration of action. However, unlike Captopril, Enalapril does not have a thiol moiety. == History == Squibb developed the first ACE inhibitor, captopril, but it had adverse effects such as a metallic taste (which, as it turned out, was due to the sulfhydryl group). Merck developed enalapril as a competing product.: 12–13 Enalaprilat was developed first, partly to overcome these limitations of captopril. The sulfhydryl moiety was replaced by a carboxylate moiety, but additional modifications were required in its structure-based design to achieve a potency similar to captopril. Enalaprilat, however, had a problem of its own in that it had poor oral availability. This was overcome by the Merck researchers through the esterification of enalaprilat with ethanol to produce enalapril. Merck introduced enalapril to market in 1981; it became Merck's first billion dollar-selling drug in 1988. The patent expired in 2000, opening the way for generics. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In September 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a pediatric use marketing authorization for the medicinal product Aqumeldi, intended for the treatment of heart failure in children from birth to less than 18 years of age. The applicant for this medicinal product is Proveca Pharma Limited. Aqumeldi was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2023. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
196	Amlodipine	WIKIPEDIA	Amlodipine, sold under the brand name Norvasc among others, is a calcium channel blocker medication used to treat high blood pressure, coronary artery disease (CAD) and variant angina (also called Prinzmetal angina or coronary artery vasospasm, among other names). It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). Common side effects include swelling, feeling tired, abdominal pain, and nausea. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure or heart attack. Whether use is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding is unclear. When used by people with liver problems, and in elderly individuals, doses should be reduced. Amlodipine works partly by vasodilation (relaxing the arteries and increasing their diameter). It is a long-acting calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine type. Amlodipine was patented in 1982, and approved for medical use in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the fifth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 70 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == Amlodipine is used in the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) and coronary artery disease in people with either stable angina (where chest pain occurs mostly after physical or emotional stress) or vasospastic angina (where it occurs in cycles) and without heart failure. It can be used as either monotherapy or combination therapy for the management of hypertension or coronary artery disease. Amlodipine can be administered to adults and to children 6–17 years of age. Calcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, may provide greater protection against stroke than beta blockers. Evidence from two meta-analyses has reported no significant difference between calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics and angiotensin receptor blockers in stroke protection while one 2015 meta-analysis has suggested that calcium channel blockers offer greater protection against stroke than other classes of antihypertensive. Amlodipine along with other calcium channel blockers are considered the first choice in the pharmacological management of Raynaud's phenomenon. === Combination therapy === Amlodipine can be given as a combination therapy with a variety of medications: Amlodipine/atorvastatin, where amlodipine is given for hypertension or CAD and atorvastatin prevents cardiovascular events, or if the person also has high cholesterol. Amlodipine/aliskiren or amlodipine/aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide if amlodipine alone cannot reduce blood pressure. Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor, which works to reduce primary hypertension (that with no known cause) by binding to renin and preventing it from initiating the renin–angiotensin system (RAAS) pathway to increase blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and decreases overall blood volume. Amlodipine/benazepril if either drug has failed individually, or amlodipine alone caused edema. Benazepril is an ACE inhibitor and blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the RAAS pathway. Amlodipine/celecoxib Amlodipine/lisinopril Amlodipine/olmesartan or amlodipine/olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide if amlodipine is insufficient in reducing blood pressure. Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and blocks part of the RAAS pathway. Amlodipine/perindopril if using amlodipine alone caused edema. Perindopril is a long-lasting ACE inhibitor. Amlodipine/telmisartan, where telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Amlodipine/valsartan or amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, where valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. == Contraindications == The only absolute contraindication to amlodipine is an allergy to amlodipine or any other dihydropyridines. Other situations occur, however, where amlodipine generally should not be used. In patients with cardiogenic shock, where the heart's ventricles are not able to pump enough blood, calcium channel blockers exacerbate the situation by preventing the flow of calcium ions into cardiac cells, which is required for the heart to pump. While use in patients with aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aorta where it meets the left ventricle) since it does not inhibit the ventricle's function is generally safe, it can still cause collapse in cases of severe stenosis. In unstable angina (excluding variant angina), amlodipine can cause a reflex increase in cardiac contractility (how hard the ventricles squeeze) and heart rate, which together increase the demand for oxygen by the heart itself. Patients with severe hypotension can have their low blood pressure exacerbated, and patients in heart failure can get pulmonary edema. Those with impaired liver function are unable to metabolize amlodipine to its full extent, giving it a longer half-life than typical. Amlodipine's safety in pregnancy has not been established, although reproductive toxicity at high doses is known. Whether amlodipine enters the milk of breastfeeding mothers is also unknown. Those who have heart failure, or recently had a heart attack, should take amlodipine with caution. == Adverse effects == Some common dose-dependent adverse effects of amlodipine include vasodilatory effects, peripheral edema, dizziness, palpitations, and flushing. Peripheral edema (fluid accumulation in the tissues) occurs at rate of 10.8% at a 10-mg dose (versus 0.6% for placebos), and is three times more likely in women than in men. It causes more dilation in the arterioles and precapillary vessels than the postcapillary vessels and venules. The increased dilation allows for more blood, which is unable to push through to the relatively constricted postcapillary venules and vessels; the pressure causes much of the plasma to move into the interstitial space. Amlodipine-association edema can be avoided by adding ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Of the other dose-dependent side effects, palpitations (4.5% at 10 mg vs. 0.6% in placebos) and flushing (2.6% vs. 0%) occurred more often in women; dizziness (3.4% vs. 1.5%) had no sex bias. Common but not dose-related adverse effects are fatigue (4.5% vs. 2.8% with a placebo), nausea (2.9% vs. 1.9%), abdominal pain (1.6% vs. 0.3%), and drowsiness (1.4% vs. 0.6%). Side effects occurring less than 1% of the time include: blood disorders, impotence, depression, peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, tachycardia, gingival enlargement, hepatitis, and jaundice. Amlodipine-associated gingival overgrowth is a relatively common side effect with exposure to amlodipine. Poor dental health and buildup of dental plaque are risk factors. Amlodipine may increase the risk of worsening angina or acute myocardial infarction, especially in those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, upon dosage initiation or increase. However, depending on the situation, amlodipine inhibits constriction and restores blood flow in coronary arteries as a result of its acting directly on vascular smooth muscle, causing a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and a consequent reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine and other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are associated with primary open angle glaucoma. == Overdose == Although rare, amlodipine overdose toxicity can result in widening of blood vessels, severe low blood pressure, and fast heart rate. Toxicity is generally managed with fluid replacement monitoring ECG results, vital signs, respiratory system function, glucose levels, kidney function, electrolyte levels, and urine output. Vasopressors are also administered when low blood pressure is not alleviated by fluid resuscitation. == Interactions == Several drugs interact with amlodipine to increase its levels in the body. CYP3A inhibitors, by nature of inhibiting the enzyme that metabolizes amlodipine, CYP3A4, are one such class of drugs. Others include the calcium-channel blocker diltiazem, the antibiotic clarithromycin, and possibly some antifungals. Amlodipine causes several drugs to increase in levels, including cyclosporine, simvastatin, and tacrolimus (the increase in the last one being more likely in people with CYP3A5*3 genetic polymorphisms). When more than 20 mg of simvastatin, a lipid-lowering agent, are given with amlodipine, the risk of myopathy increases. The FDA issued a warning to limit simvastatin to a maximum dose of 20 mg if taken with amlodipine based on evidence from the SEARCH trial. Giving amlodipine with Viagra increases the risk of hypotension. == Pharmacology == Amlodipine is a long-acting calcium channel antagonist that selectively inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes. It targets L-type calcium channels in muscle cells and N-type calcium channels in the central nervous system which are involved in nociceptive signalling and pain perception. Amlodipine has an inhibitory effect on calcium influx in smooth muscle cells to inhibit contraction. Amlodipine ends up significantly reducing total vascular resistance without decreasing cardiac output expressed by pressure-rate product and cardiac contractability in comparison with verapamil, a non-dihydropyridine. In turn, following treatment lasting a month, with amlodipine, cardiac output is significantly enhanced. Unlike verapamil which has efficacy in moderation of emotional arousal and reduces cardiac load without lowering cardiac output demands, amlodipine increases the cardiac output response concomitantly with increased functional cardiac load. === Mechanism of action === Amlodipine is an angioselective calcium channel blocker and inhibits the movement of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells which inhibits the contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle cells. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells. This causes vasodilation and a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, thus lowering blood pressure. Its effects on cardiac muscle also prevent excessive constriction in the coronary arteries. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro, but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Among the two stereoisomers [R(+), S(–)], the (–) isomer has been reported to be more active than the (+) isomer. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. And it specifically inhibits the currents of L-type Cav1.3 channels in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland. The mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina are: Stable angina: amlodipine reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, thereby lowering myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise. Variant angina: amlodipine blocks spasm of the coronary arteries and restores blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium, epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro. Amlodipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid. === Pharmacokinetics === Amlodipine has been studied in healthy volunteers following oral administration of 14C-labelled drug. Amlodipine is well absorbed by the oral route with a mean oral bioavailability around 60%; the half-life of amlodipine is about 30 h to 50 h, and steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved after 7 to 8 days of daily dosing. In the blood it has high plasma protein binding of 97.5%. Its long half-life and high bioavailability are largely in part of its high pKa (8.6); it is ionized at physiological pH, and thus can strongly attract proteins. It is slowly metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, with its amine group being oxidized and its side ester chain being hydrolyzed, resulting in an inactive pyridine metabolite. Renal elimination is the major route of excretion with about 60% of an administered dose recovered in urine, largely as inactive pyridine metabolites. However, renal impairment does not significantly influence amlodipine elimination. 20-25% of the drug is excreted in the faeces. == History == Pfizer's patent protection on Norvasc lasted until 2007; total patent expiration occurred later in 2007. A number of generic versions are available. In the United Kingdom, tablets of amlodipine from different suppliers may contain different salts. The strength of the tablets is expressed in terms of amlodipine base, i.e., without the salts. Tablets containing different salts are therefore considered interchangeable. A fixed-dose combination of amlodipine and perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is also available. The medical form comes as besilate, mesylate, or maleate. == Society and culture == === Brand names === In the US, Norvasc is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == Veterinary use == Amlodipine is most often used to treat systemic hypertension in both cats and dogs. In cats, it is the first line of treatment due to its efficacy and few side effects. Systemic hypertension in cats is usually secondary to another abnormality, such as chronic kidney disease, and so amlodipine is most often administered to cats with kidney disease. While amlodipine is used in dogs with systemic hypertension, it is not as efficacious. Amlodipine is also used to treat congestive heart failure due to mitral valve regurgitation in dogs. By decreasing resistance to forward flow in the systemic circulation it results in a decrease in regurgitant flow into the left atrium. Similarly, it can be used on dogs and cats with left-to-right shunting lesions such as ventricular septal defect to reduce the shunt. Side effects are rare in cats. In dogs, the primary side effect is gingival hyperplasia. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
197	Hydroxychloroquine	WIKIPEDIA	"Hydroxychloroquine, sold under the brand name Plaquenil among others, is a medication used to prevent and treat malaria in areas where malaria remains sensitive to chloroquine. Other uses include treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and porphyria cutanea tarda. It is taken by mouth, often in the form of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Common side effects may include vomiting, headache, blurred vision, and muscle weakness. Severe side effects may include allergic reactions, retinopathy, and irregular heart rate. Although all risk cannot be excluded, it remains a treatment for rheumatic disease during pregnancy. Hydroxychloroquine is in the antimalarial and 4-aminoquinoline families of medication. Hydroxychloroquine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 112th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. Hydroxychloroquine has been studied for an ability to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but clinical trials found it ineffective for this purpose and a possible risk of dangerous side effects. Among studies that deemed hydroxychloroquine intake to cause harmful side effects, a publication by The Lancet was retracted due to data flaws. The speculative use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 threatens its availability for people with established indications. == Medical uses == Hydroxychloroquine treats rheumatic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and porphyria cutanea tarda, and certain infections such as Q fever and certain types of malaria. It is considered the first-line treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus. Certain types of malaria, resistant strains, and complicated cases require different or additional medication. It is widely used to treat primary Sjögren syndrome but does not appear to be effective. Hydroxychloroquine is widely used in the treatment of post-Lyme arthritis. It may have both an anti-spirochete activity and an anti-inflammatory activity, similar to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. == Contraindications == The US FDA drug label advises that hydroxychloroquine should not be prescribed to individuals with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds. There are several other contraindications, and caution is required if the person considered for treatment has certain heart conditions, diabetes, or psoriasis. == Adverse effects == Hydroxychloroquine has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning there is little difference between toxic and therapeutic doses. The most common adverse effects are nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea. Other common adverse effects include itching and headache. The most serious adverse effects affect the eye, with dose-related retinopathy as a concern even after hydroxychloroquine use is discontinued. Serious reported neuropsychiatric adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine use include agitation, mania, difficulty sleeping, hallucinations, psychosis, catatonia, paranoia, depression, and suicidal thoughts. In rare situations, hydroxychloroquine has been implicated in cases of serious skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Reported blood abnormalities with its use include lymphopenia, eosinophilia, and atypical lymphocytosis. For short-term treatment of acute malaria, adverse effects can include abdominal cramps, diarrhea, heart problems, reduced appetite, headache, nausea and vomiting. Other adverse effects noted with short-term use of Hydroxychloroquine include low blood sugar and QT interval prolongation. Idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. For prolonged treatment of lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, adverse effects include the acute symptoms, plus altered eye pigmentation, acne, anemia, bleaching of hair, blisters in mouth and eyes, blood disorders, cardiomyopathy, convulsions, vision difficulties, diminished reflexes, emotional changes, excessive coloring of the skin, hearing loss, hives, itching, liver problems or liver failure, loss of hair, muscle paralysis, weakness or atrophy, nightmares, psoriasis, reading difficulties, tinnitus, skin inflammation and scaling, skin rash, vertigo, weight loss, and occasionally urinary incontinence. Hydroxychloroquine can worsen existing cases of both psoriasis and porphyria. Children may be especially vulnerable to developing adverse effects from hydroxychloroquine overdoses. === Eyes === One of the most serious side effects is retinopathy (generally with chronic use). People taking 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine or less per day generally have a negligible risk of macular toxicity, whereas the risk begins to increase when a person takes the medication over five years or has a cumulative dose of more than 1000 grams. The daily safe maximum dose for eye toxicity can be estimated from a person's height and weight. Macular toxicity is related to the total cumulative dose rather than the daily dose. Regular eye screening, even in the absence of visual symptoms, is recommended to begin when either of these risk factors occurs. Toxicity from hydroxychloroquine may be seen in two distinct areas of the eye: the cornea and the macula. The cornea may become affected (relatively commonly) by an innocuous cornea verticillata or vortex keratopathy and is characterized by whorl-like corneal epithelial deposits. These changes bear no relationship to dosage and are usually reversible on cessation of hydroxychloroquine. The macular changes are potentially serious. Advanced retinopathy is characterized by reduction of visual acuity and a ""bull's eye"" macular lesion which is absent in early involvement. == Overdose == Overdoses of hydroxychloroquine are extremely rare, but extremely toxic. Eight people are known to have overdosed since the drug's introduction in the mid-1950s, of which three have died. Chloroquine has a risk of death in overdose in adults of about 20%, while hydroxychloroquine is estimated to be two or threefold less toxic. Serious signs and symptoms of overdose generally occur within an hour of ingestion. These may include sleepiness, vision changes, seizures, coma, stopping of breathing, and heart problems such as ventricular fibrillation and low blood pressure. Loss of vision may be permanent. Low blood potassium, to levels of 1 to 2 mmol/L, may also occur. Cardiovascular abnormalities such as QRS complex widening and QT interval prolongation may also occur. Treatment recommendations include early mechanical ventilation, heart monitoring, and activated charcoal. Supportive treatment with intravenous fluids and vasopressors may be required with epinephrine being the vasopressor of choice. Stomach pumping may also be used. Sodium bicarbonate and hypertonic saline may be used in cases of severe QRS complex widening. Seizures may be treated with benzodiazepines. Intravenous potassium chloride may be required, however this may result in high blood potassium later in the course of the disease. Dialysis does not appear to be useful. === Detection === Hydroxychloroquine may be quantified in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of sudden or unexpected death. Plasma or serum concentrations are usually in a range of 0.1-1.6 mg/L during therapy and 6–20 mg/L in cases of clinical intoxication, while blood levels of 20–100 mg/L have been observed in deaths due to acute overdosage. == Interactions == The drug transfers into breast milk. There is no evidence that its use during pregnancy is harmful to the developing fetus and its use is not contraindicated in pregnancy. The concurrent use of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin appears to increase the risk for certain serious side effects with short-term use, such as an increased risk of chest pain, congestive heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular causes. Care should be taken if combined with medication altering liver function as well as aurothioglucose (Solganal), cimetidine (Tagamet) or digoxin (Lanoxin). Hydroxychloroquine can increase plasma concentrations of penicillamine which may contribute to the development of severe side effects. It enhances hypoglycemic effects of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. Dose altering is recommended to prevent profound hypoglycemia. Antacids may decrease the absorption of hydroxychloroquine. Both neostigmine and pyridostigmine antagonize the action of hydroxychloroquine. While there may be a link between hydroxychloroquine and hemolytic anemia in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, this risk may be low in those of African descent. Specifically, the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) drug label for hydroxychloroquine lists the following drug interactions: Digoxin (wherein it may result in increased serum digoxin levels) Insulin or anti-diabetic medication (wherein it may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment) Drugs that prolong the QT interval such as methadone, and other arrhythmogenic drugs, as hydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval and may increase the risk of inducing serious abnormal heart rhythms (ventricular arrhythmias) if used concurrently. Mefloquine and other drugs known to lower the seizure threshold (co-administration with other antimalarials known to lower the convulsion threshold may increase risk of convulsions) Antiepileptics (concurrent use may impair the antiepileptic activity) Methotrexate (combined use is unstudied and may increase the frequency of side effects) Cyclosporin (wherein an increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when used together). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === Hydroxychloroquine has similar pharmacokinetics to chloroquine, with rapid gastrointestinal absorption, large distribution volume, and elimination by the kidneys; Tmax is 2–4.5 hours. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2D6, 2C8, 3A4 and 3A5) metabolize hydroxychloroquine to N-desethylhydroxychloroquine. Both agents also inhibit CYP2D6 activity and may interact with other medications that depend on this enzyme. === Pharmacodynamics === Antimalarials are lipophilic weak bases and easily pass plasma membranes. The free base form accumulates in lysosomes (acidic cytoplasmic vesicles) and is then protonated, resulting in concentrations within lysosomes up to 1,000 times higher than in culture media. This increases the pH of the lysosome from four to six. Alteration in pH causes inhibition of lysosomal acidic proteases causing a diminished proteolysis effect. Higher pH within lysosomes causes decreased intracellular processing, glycosylation and secretion of proteins with many immunologic and nonimmunologic consequences. These effects are believed to be the cause of a decreased immune cell functioning such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and superoxide production by neutrophils. Hydroxychloroquine is a weak diprotic base that can pass through the lipid cell membrane and preferentially concentrate in acidic cytoplasmic vesicles. The higher pH of these vesicles in macrophages or other antigen-presenting cells limits the association of autoantigenic (any) peptides with class II MHC molecules in the compartment for peptide loading and/or the subsequent processing and transport of the peptide-MHC complex to the cell membrane. === Mechanism of action === Hydroxychloroquine increases lysosomal pH in antigen-presenting cells by two mechanisms: As a weak base, it is a proton acceptor and via this chemical interaction, its accumulation in lysozymes raises the intralysosomal pH, but this mechanism does not fully account for the effect of hydroxychloroquine on pH. Additionally, in parasites that are susceptible to hydroxychloroquine, it interferes with the endocytosis and proteolysis of hemoglobin and inhibits the activity of lysosomal enzymes, thereby raising the lysosomal pH by more than 2 orders of magnitude over the weak base effect alone. In 2003, a novel mechanism was described wherein hydroxychloroquine inhibits stimulation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 family receptors. TLRs are cellular receptors for microbial products that induce inflammatory responses through activation of the innate immune system. As with other quinoline antimalarial drugs, the antimalarial mechanism of action of quinine has not been fully resolved. The most accepted model is based on hydrochloroquinine and involves the inhibition of hemozoin biocrystallization, which facilitates the aggregation of cytotoxic heme. Free cytotoxic heme accumulates in the parasites, causing death. Hydroxychloroquine increases the risk of low blood sugar through several mechanisms. These include decreased clearance of the hormone insulin from the blood, increased insulin sensitivity, and increased release of insulin from the pancreas. == History == After World War I, the German government sought alternatives to quinine as an anti-malarial. Chloroquine, a synthetic analogue with the same mechanism of action was discovered in 1934, by Hans Andersag and coworkers at the Bayer laboratories.: 130–131 This was introduced into clinical practice in 1947 for the prophylactic treatment of malaria. Researchers subsequently attempted to discover structural analogs with superior properties and one of these was hydroxychloroquine. === Chemical synthesis === The first synthesis of hydroxychloroquine was disclosed in a patent filed by Sterling Drug in 1949. In the final step, 4,7-dichloroquinoline was reacted with a primary amine which in turn had been made from the chloro-ketone shown: == Manufacturing == It is frequently sold as a sulfate salt known as hydroxychloroquine sulfate. In the sulfate salt form, 200 mg is equal to 155 mg of the pure form.

204	Glyceryl monostearate	WIKIPEDIA	"Glycerol monostearate, commonly known as GMS, is a monoglyceride commonly used as an emulsifier in foods. It takes the form of a white, odorless, and sweet-tasting flaky powder that is hygroscopic. Chemically it is the glycerol ester of stearic acid. It is also used as hydration powder in exercise formulas == Structure, synthesis, and occurrence == Glycerol monostearate exists as three stereoisomers, the enantiomeric pair of 1-glycerol monostearate and 2-glycerol monostearate. Typically these are encountered as a mixture as many of their properties are similar. Commercial material used in foods is produced industrially by a glycerolysis reaction between triglycerides (from either vegetable or animal fats) and glycerol. Glycerol monostearate occurs naturally in the body as a product of the breakdown of fats by pancreatic lipase. It is present at very low levels in certain seed oils. == Uses == GMS is a food additive used as a thickening, emulsifying, anticaking, and preservative agent; an emulsifying agent for oils, waxes, and solvents; a protective coating for hygroscopic powders; a solidifier and control release agent in pharmaceuticals; and a resin lubricant. It is also used in cosmetics and hair-care products. GMS is largely used in baking preparations to add ""body"" to the food. It is somewhat responsible for giving ice cream and whipped cream their smooth texture. It is sometimes used as an antistaling agent in bread. It can also be used as an additive in plastic, where GMS works as an antistatic and antifogging agent. This is common in food packaging. == See also == Glyceryl hydroxystearate Monolaurin == Compendial status == British Pharmacopoeia == References =="	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL	{'FO': -0.0013460657, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -0.020222897, ' PERSON': -0.0039642975, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0, ' IND': -0.09040743, 'UST': -5.080963e-06, 'RI': 0.0}

222	Palmitoylethanolamide	WIKIPEDIA	"Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous fatty acid amide, and lipid modulator. A main target of PEA is proposed to be the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α). PEA also has affinity to cannabinoid-like G-coupled receptors GPR55 and GPR119. PEA cannot strictly be considered a classic endocannabinoid because it lacks affinity for the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. == Early and recent studies == In 1975, Czech physicians described the results of a clinical trial looking at joint pain, where the analgesic action of aspirin versus PEA was tested; both drugs were reported to enhance joint movements and decrease pain. In 1970 the drug manufacturer Spofa in Czechoslovakia introduced Impulsin, a tablet dose of PEA, for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and other respiratory infections. In Spain, the company Almirall introduced Palmidrol in tablet and suspension forms in 1976, for the same indications. In the mid-1990s, the relationship between anandamide and PEA was described; the expression of mast cell receptors sensitive to the two molecules was demonstrated by Levi-Montalcini and coworkers. During this period, more insight into the functions of endogenous fatty acid derivatives emerged, and compounds such as oleamide, palmitoylethanolamide, 2-lineoylglycerol and 2-palmitoylglycerol were explored for their capacity to modulate pain sensitivity and inflammation via what at that time was thought to be the endocannabinoid signalling pathway. Primary reports also have provided evidence that PEA downregulates hyperactive mast cells in a dose-dependent manner, and that it alleviates pain elicited in mouse models. PEA and related compounds such as anandamide also seem to have synergistic effects in models of pain and analgesia. == Animal models == In a variety of animal models, PEA seems to have some promise; researchers have been able to demonstrate relevant clinical efficacy in a variety of disorders, from multiple sclerosis to neuropathic pain. In the mouse forced swimming test, palmitoylethanolamide was comparable to fluoxetine for depression. An Italian study published in 2011 found that PEA reduced the raised intraocular pressure of glaucoma. In a spinal trauma model, PEA reduced the resulting neurological deficit via the reduction of mast cell infiltration and activation. PEA in this model also reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Its activity as an inhibitor of inflammation counteracts reactive astrogliosis induced by beta-amyloid peptide, in a model relevant for neurodegeneration, probably via the PPAR-α mechanism of action. In models of stroke and other CNS trauma, PEA exerted neuroprotective properties. == Animal models of chronic pain and inflammation == Chronic pain and neuropathic pain are indications for which there is high unmet need in the clinic. PEA has been tested in a variety of animal models for chronic and neuropathic pain, because cannabinoids, such as THC, have been proven to be effective in neuropathic pain states. The analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects of PEA in two models of acute and persistent pain seemed to be explained at least partly via the de novo neurosteroid synthesis. In chronic granulomatous pain and inflammation model, PEA could prevent nerve formation and sprouting, mechanical allodynia, and PEA inhibited dorsal root ganglia activation, which is a hallmark for winding up in neuropathic pain. The mechanism of action of PEA as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory molecule is probably based on different aspects. PEA inhibits the release of both preformed and newly synthesised mast cell mediators, such as histamine and TNF-alpha. PEA, as well as its analogue adelmidrol (di-amide derivative of azelaic acid), can both down-regulate mast cells. PEA reduces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and prevents IkB-alpha degradation and p65 NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, the latter related to PEA as an endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist. In 2012 it became clear that PEA can also reduce reperfusion injury and the negative impact of shock on various outcome parameters, such as renal dysfunction, ischemic injury and inflammation, most probably via the PPAR-alpha pathway. Studies have shown that PEA activates PPAR-alpha and TRPV1 receptors that control inflammation and the sensation of pain. Among the reperfusion and inflammation markers measured PEA could reduce the increase in creatinine, γGT, AST, nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65; kidney MPO activity and MDA levels, nitrotyrosine, PAR and adhesion molecules expression, the infiltration and activation of mast cells and apoptosis. The biological responses to PEA dosing in animal models and in humans are being investigated vis-à-vis its involvement in a repair mechanism relevant to patient conditions of chronic inflammation and chronic pain. In a model of visceral pain (inflammation of the urinary bladder) PEA was able to attenuate the viscero-visceral hyper-reflexia induced by inflammation of the urinary bladder, one of the reasons why PEA is currently explored in the painful bladder syndrome. In a different model for bladder pain, the turpentine-induced urinary bladder inflammation in the rat, PEA also attenuated a referred hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent way. Chronic pelvic pain in patients seem to respond favourably to a treatment with PEA. == Activity in non-neuronal cells == PEA, as an N-acylethanolamine, has physico-chemical properties comparable to anandamide, and, while it is not strictly an endocannabinoid, it is often studied in conjunction with anandamide because of their overlapping synthetic and metabolic pathways. N-acylethanolamines such as PEA often act as signaling molecules, activating receptors and regulating a variety of physiological functions. PEA is known to activate intracellular, nuclear and membrane-associated receptors, and to regulate many physiological functions related to the inflammatory cascade and chronic pain states. Endocannabinoid lipids like PEA are widely distributed in nature, in a variety of plant, invertebrate, and mammalian tissues. PEA's mechanism of action sometimes is described as Autacoid Local Injury Antagonism (acronym ALIA), and PEA under this nomenclature is an ALIAmide. Levi-Montalcini and coworkers presented evidence in 1993 that lipid amides of the N-acylethanolamine type, such as PEA, are potential prototypes of naturally occurring molecules capable of modulating mast cell activation, and her group used the acronym ALIA in that report. An autocoid is a regulating molecule, locally produced. An ALIAmide is an autocoid synthesized on-demand in response to injury, and acts locally to counteract such pathology. Soon after the breakthrough paper of Levi-Montalcini, the mast cell appeared to be an important target for the anti-inflammatory activity of PEA. Since 1993, at least 25 papers have been published on the various effects of PEA on mast cells. These cells are often found in proximity to sensory nerve endings, and their degranulation can enhance the nociceptive signal, the reason why peripheral mast cells are considered to be pro-inflammatory and pro-nociceptive. PEA's activity is currently seen as a new inroad in the treatment of neuropathic pain and related disorders based on overactivation of glia and glia-related cells, such as in diabetes and glaucoma. Microglia plays a key role in the winding up phenomenon and central sensitization. == Clinical relevance == Effects of oral dosing of PEA has been explored in humans, and include clinical trials for a variety of pain states, for inflammatory and pain syndromes. Daily doses range from 300 to 1200 mg per day. In a 2017 systematic meta-analysis involving 10 studies including data from 786 patients receiving PEA for pain-related indications and 512 controls, PEA was found to be associated with pain reduction significantly greater than observed in controls (P < 0.001). Positive influences have also been observed in dermal applications, specifically atopic eczema, which may be linked to PPAR alpha activation. In a 2015 analysis of a double blind placebo controlled study of PEA in sciatic pain, the Numbers Needed to Treat was 1.5. Its positive influence in chronic pain, and inflammatory states such as atopic eczema, seems to originate mainly from PPAR alpha activation. Since 2012 a number of new trials have been published, among which studies in glaucoma. PEA also seems to be one of the factors responsible for the decrease in pain sensitivity during and after sport, comparable to the endogenous opiates (endorphines). From a clinical perspective the most important and promising indications for PEA are linked to neuropathic and chronic pain states, such as diabetic neuropathic pain, sciatic pain, CRPS, pelvic pain and entrapment neuropathic pain states. In a blind trial reported in a conference proceeding, patients affected by pain from synovitis or TMJ osteoarthritis (N=25, in total) were randomly assigned to PEA or ibuprofen groups for two weeks; the decrease in pain reported after two weeks was significantly higher for the PEA-treated group, likewise for improved masticatory function. In 2012, 20 patients with thalidomide and bortezomib induced neuropathy were reported to have improved nerve functions and less pain after a two-month treatment with PEA. The authors pointed out that although a placebo effect might play a role in the reported pain relief, the changes in neurophysiological measures clearly indicated that PEA exerted a positive action on the myelinated fibre groups. Sixteen men and fourteen women with two major types of neuropathic pain refractory to analgesic treatment—peripheral diabetic neuropathy (4 men, 7 women) or post-herpetic neuralgia (12 men, 7 women)—whose symptoms spanned eight pain categories (""burning"", ""osteoarticular"", ""piercing"", etc.) who were under prior treatment with pregabalin were transferred to PEA, after which pregabalin treatment was gradually reintroduced; all were responding well after 45 days, and presented significant decreases in pain scores (without drug-drug interactions). In 2013, a metareview was published on the clinical efficacy and safety of PEA in the treatment of the common cold and influenza, based on reports from six double-blind, placebo, randomized controlled trials, addressing PEA's proposed anti-inflammatory and retinoprotectant effects. In 2019, significant increases in fatty acid amides including PEA, arachidonoylethanolamide, and oleoylethanolamide were noted in a Scottish woman with a previously undocumented variant of congenital insensitivity to pain. This was found to be a result of a combination of a hypomorphic single nucleotide polymorphism of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), alongside a mutation of the pseudogene, FAAH-OUT. The pseudogene was previously considered to be non-coding DNA, FAAH-OUT was found to be capable of modulating the expression of FAAH, making it a possible future target for novel analgesia/anxiolytic drug development. In 2020, PEA has been suggested as a drug that may prove beneficial for the treatment of lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. A pharmaceutical company called FSD Pharma have entered PEA into a Phase 1 clinical trial under the name FSD-201, and has approval from the FDA for progressing to Phase 2a for this indication. == Metabolism == PEA is metabolized by the cellular enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acylethanolamine acid amide hydrolase (NAAA), the latter of which has more specificity toward PEA over other fatty acid amides. == Safety == PEA is generally considered safe, and without adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or drug interactions. A 2016 study assessing safety claims in sixteen clinical trials, six case reports/pilot studies and a meta‐analysis of PEA as an analgesic, concluded that for treatment periods up to 49 days, clinical data argued against serious ADRs at an incidence of 1/200 or greater. A 2016 pooled meta-analysis involving twelve studies found that no serious ADRs were registered and/or reported. No data on interactions with PEA have been reported. Based on its mechanism, PEA may be considered likely to interact with other PPAR-α agonists used to treat high triglycerides; this remains unconfirmed. == See also == N-Acylethanolamine N-Acylphosphatidylethanolamine == References == == Further reading =="	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.2339975, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -1.247159e-05, ' MED': -0.0007721053, 'ICAL': 0.0}
223	Sphinganine	WIKIPEDIA	Safingol is a lyso-sphingolipid protein kinase inhibitor. It has the molecular formula C18H39NO2 and is a colorless solid. Medicinally, safingol has demonstrated promising anticancer potential as a modulator of multi-drug resistance and as an inducer of necrosis. The administration of safingol alone has not been shown to exert a significant effect on tumor cell growth. However, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that combining safingol with conventional chemotherapy agents such as fenretinide, vinblastine, irinotecan and mitomycin C can dramatically potentiate their antitumor effects. In phase I clinical trials, it was found to be safe to co-administer with cisplatin, but caused reversible dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. == Mechanism == The underlying mechanism by which safingol induces cell death is poorly understood. It is believed to exert a variety of inhibitory effects, resulting in a series of cascades that result in accidental necrotic cell death brought about by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mediated by autophagy. Increased autophagic activity has been associated with increased cellular death, although it is unclear if there is any causative relationship between the two. Because autophagy normally plays a pro-survival role by impeding apoptosis, it is curious that it may play a role in cell death following safingol exposure. Safingol competitively competes with phorbol dibutyrate at regulatory domains of the protein kinase C family, inhibiting the activation of such enzymes as PKCβ-I, PKCδ, and PKCε. Safingol can also inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3k), which is a critical component of the mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways. Furthermore, safingol, like other sphingolipids, has been found to inhibit glucose uptake. This results in oxidative stress, leading to the generation of ROS that are both time and concentration-dependent. Together, the inhibitory signaling effects (particularly of PKCε and PI3k) and the presence of ROS synergize to induce autophagy. Following autophagic activity, cell death is eventually induced by an as of yet unknown mechanism. Missing from this cellular death are any signs of apoptotic induction such as characteristic changes to nuclear morphology and PARP cleavage. Instead, several hallmarks of necrosis are observed, such as caspase-independent cell death, the loss of plasma membrane integrity, the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the depletion of intracellular ATP. However, the involvement of RIPK1 has not been observed, suggesting that this necrosis is accidental in nature and not programmed. One potential explanation for safingol’s cytotoxicity is that high concentrations result in ROS-related molecular and cellular damage that is beyond repair. Therefore, autophagy does not directly contribute to death, but is rather a failed attempt to preserve cell viability. However, not only does this hypothesis warrants further testing, but safingol has demonstrated unusual regulatory effects on other pathways capable of regulating autophagy. As expected, a decrease in glucose heightens AMPK phosphorylation. However, an initial increase in phosphorylated mTOR is also observed, which eventually reduces after several hours. The mTOR pathway normally inhibits autophagy, as is induced by heightened glucose uptake. Therefore, decreasing glucose levels should suppress the mTOR pathway, allowing for autophagy. While autophagy is indeed observed following exposure of safingol, it is intriguing that mTOR is activated initially. Modulations in Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and endonuclease G from mitochondria are also thought to play a role in safingol-induced cellular death by regulating autophagy. Safingol is also a putative inhibitor of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK), which catalyzes the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), an important mediator of cancer cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. This ability further contributes to its anticancer potential. It can also affect the balance of other endogenous sphingolipids, particularly ceramide and dihydroceramide, which have been implicated in autophagic induction and ROS production. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -8.42322e-05, 'ICAL': 0.0}
238	Ethyl oleate	WIKIPEDIA	Ethyl oleate is a fatty acid ester formed by the condensation of oleic acid and ethanol. It is a colorless oil although degraded samples can appear yellow. == Use and occurrence == === Additive === Ethyl oleate is used by compounding pharmacies as a vehicle for intramuscular drug delivery, in some cases to prepare the daily doses of progesterone in support of pregnancy. Studies that document the safe use of ethyl oleate in pregnancy for both the mother and the fetus have never been performed. It is regulated as a food additive in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration. Ethyl oleate is used as a solvent for pharmaceutical drug preparations involving lipophilic substances such as steroids. It also finds use as a lubricant and a plasticizer. Louis Bouveault used ethyl oleate to demonstrate Bouveault–Blanc reduction, producing oleyl alcohol and ethanol, a method which was subsequently refined and published in Organic Syntheses. === Occurrence === Ethyl oleate has been identified as a primer pheromone in honeybees. === Precursor to other chemicals === By the process of ethenolysis, the methyl ester of oleic acid, converts to 1-decene and methyl 9-decenoate: CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7CO2Me + CH2=CH2 → CH3(CH2)7CH=CH2 + MeO2C(CH2)7CH=CH2 === Medical aspects === Ethyl oleate is produced by the body during ethanol intoxication. It is one of the fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) produced after ingestion of ethanol. Some research literature implicates FAEEs such as ethyl oleate as the toxic mediators of ethanol in the body (pancreas, liver, heart, and brain). Ethyl oleate may be the toxic mediator of alcohol in fetal alcohol syndrome. The oral ingestion of ethyl oleate has been carefully studied and due to rapid degradation in the digestive tract it appears safe for oral ingestion. == See also == Butyl oleate Oleate == References ==	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, ENDOGENOUS	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL	{'MED': -0.051051676, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.05214138, ' FOOD': -0.056499712, ' PERSON': -0.028963095, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0, ' IND': -0.0060711177, 'UST': -5.2001665e-06, 'RI': -5.5122365e-07}
245	N-oleoylethanolamine	PUBMED	 Cancer is a complex disease that derives from the uncontrolled proliferation of cells. Bone cancer is a type of prevalent cancer that occurs both in young and adults. Bone cancer is most common in the long bones of the pelvis, arms and legs. Statistically, more than 200 cases of osteosarcoma have been reported annually in our country. Classical treatment with chemotherapeutics remains ineffective in the cure of this cancer type. Recent studies have shown that ceramide induces apoptosis at its increased levels in the cells. Thus, many studies have been conducted to cause the accumulation of ceramide molecules in the cell by different ways to induce apoptosis. NOE (Noleoylethanolamine) is a specific inhibitor of ceramidase enzymes that hydrolyze intracellular ceramides and prevent apoptosis. This study investigates the cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing activities of NOE on human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells. Cytotoxic effects were investigated by MTT colorimetric assay. For the detection of morphological and ultrastructural indicators of apoptosis, confocal and TEM techniques were used. Our finding indicated that NOE is effective in the inhibition of the growth of Saos-2 cells. Confocal and TEM findings showed morphological and ultrastructural changes as chromatin condensation, fragmentation of nuclei and mitochondria as well as damaged cytoskeleton and cell shrinkage. The results revealed that NOE exerts its cytotoxicity on Saos-2 cells through changing the ultrastructure and morphology of cells with clear apoptotic sparks. Causing more and more deaths, stroke has been a leading cause of death worldwide. However, success in clinical stroke trials has remained elusive. N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA) was an endogenous highly hydrophobic molecule with outstanding neuroprotective effect. In this article, hydrogen bonds were successfully formed between OEA and soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC). The synthetic OEA-SPC complex and DSPE-PEG were self-assembled into liposomes (OEA NPs), with OEA-SPC loaded in the core and PEG formed a hydrophilic shell. Hence, highly hydrophobic OEA was loaded into liposomes as amorphous state with a drug loading of 8.21 ± 0.18 wt%. With fairly uniform size and well-distributed character, the OEA NPs were systemically assessed as an intravenous formulation for stroke therapy. The results indicated that the administration of OEA NPs could significantly improve the survival rate and the Garcia score of the MCAO rats compared with free OEA. The TTC-stained brain slices declared that the cerebral infarct volume and the edema degree induced by MCAO could be decreased to an extremely low level  The endocannabinoid system has been considered as a target for pharmacological intervention. Accordingly, inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), a degrading enzyme of the endocannabinoids N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide; AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) as well as of the endocannabinoid-like substances N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA) and N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA), can cause augmented endogenous cannabinoid tone. Using liquid chromatography coupled with positive electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry, we herein describe a method to simultaneously quantify levels of AEA, OEA, PEA and 2-AG in cultured cells. The procedure was developed according to the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods validation. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.05 pmol for AEA, 0.09 pmol for OEA, 0.10 pmol for PEA and 0.80 pmol for 2-AG when molecular ion monitoring was used. In H460 human lung carcinoma cells, basal levels of all four analytes ranged between 2 and 17 pmol mg(-1) protein with PEA showing the lowest and OEA the highest concentrations. Endocannabinoid levels observed in mesenchymal stem cells were of the same order of magnitude when compared to those in H460 human lung carcinoma cells.

249	Elaidic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Elaidic acid is a chemical compound with the formula C18H34O2, specifically the fatty acid with structural formula HOOC−(CH2)7−CH=CH−(CH2)7−CH3, with the double bond (between carbon atoms 9 and 10) in trans configuration. It is a colorless oily solid. Its salts and esters are called elaidates. Elaidic acid is an unsaturated trans fatty acid, with code C18:1 trans-9. This compound has attracted attention because it is a major trans fat found in hydrogenated vegetable oils, and trans fats have been implicated in heart disease. It is the trans isomer of oleic acid. The name of the elaidinization reaction comes from elaidic acid. Its name comes from the Ancient Greek word ἔλαιον (elaion), meaning oil. == Occurrence and bioactivity == Elaidic acid occurs mostly in industrial hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It's also present in small amounts in caprine and bovine milk (very roughly 0.1% of the fatty acids) and in some meats.

250	12(13)-epome	PUBMED	 Epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acids (EpOMEs) are epoxide derivatives of linoleic acid (9,12-octadecadienoic acid: LA). They are metabolized into dihydroxyoctadecamonoenoic acids (DiHOMEs) in mammals. Unlike in mammals where they act as adipokines or lipokines, EpOMEs act as immunosuppressants in insects. However, the functional link between EpOMEs and pro-immune mediators such as PGE Excessive and unnecessary immune responses cause serious adverse effects due to self-tissue damage and energy consumption, particularly at the late stage of infection to terminate the induced immunity. Unlike mammals, which use long-chain fatty acid oxylipins, C18 oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids are suggested to act as immune resolvins in insects, including two epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acids (9,10-EpOME and 12,13-EpOME). This study investigated the physiological roles of EpOMEs in immune resolution in the lepidopteran insect, Maruca vitrata. The levels of two EpOMEs in the larvae increased during the late infection stage upon immune challenge. At their peak concentrations at 96 h post-infection (pi), both EpOMEs were found at similar levels: 323.18 pg/mg body weight for 9,10-EpOME and 322.07 pg/mg body weight for 12,13-EpOME. Both EpOMEs inhibited cellular and humoral immune responses, with 12,13-EpOME being more potent than 9,10-EpOME. Genes associated with EpOME synthase and degradation, identified as Mv-CYP1 and Mv-sEH, were detected in various developmental stages and tissues of M. vitrata. RNA interference (RNAi) targeting Mv-CYP1 failed to inhibit the immune response, whereas RNAi targeting Mv-sEH enhanced the immunosuppression. In contrast to the acute (< 12 h pi) immune response involving eicosanoid biosynthesis, the expression of these two genes linked to EpOME metabolism increased significantly at the late infection stage (> 12 h pi). Several alkoxide analogs of EpOME, with the epoxide group replaced by an alkoxide group, were synthesized; one such derivative demonstrated substantially greater efficacy than the natural EpOMEs in inhibiting the immune response. Additionally, using EpOME alkoxide significantly increased the effectiveness of microbial insecticides. Moreover, exposing young larvae to sublethal doses of EpOME alkoxide or sEH inhibitor induced severe developmental delays. These results suggest a novel strategy for insect pest control using insect immune resolvin analogs.	INDUSTRIAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.000509307}
252	Cannabidiol	WIKIPEDIA	"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid, one of 113 identified cannabinoids in cannabis plants, along with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and accounts for up to 40% of the plant's extract. Medically, it is an anticonvulsant used to treat multiple forms of epilepsy. It was discovered in 1940 and, as of 2024 clinical research on CBD included studies related to the treatment of anxiety, addiction, psychosis, movement disorders, and pain, but there is insufficient high-quality evidence that CBD is effective for these conditions. CBD is sold as an herbal dietary supplement and promoted with yet unproven claims of particular therapeutic effects. Cannabidiol can be taken internally in multiple ways, including by inhaling cannabis smoke or vapor, swallowing it by mouth, and through use of an aerosol spray into the cheek. It may be supplied as CBD oil containing only CBD as the active ingredient (excluding THC or terpenes), CBD-dominant hemp extract oil, capsules, dried cannabis, or prescription liquid solution. CBD does not have the same psychoactivity as THC, and can modulate the psychoactive effects of THC on the body if both are present. Conversion of CBD to THC can occur when CBD is heated to temperatures between 250–300 °C, potentially leading to its partial transformation into THC. In the United States, the cannabidiol drug Epidiolex was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 for the treatment of two seizure disorders. While the 2018 United States Farm Bill removed hemp and hemp extracts (including CBD) from the Controlled Substances Act, the marketing and sale of CBD formulations for medical use or as an ingredient in dietary supplements or manufactured foods remains illegal under FDA regulation, as of 2024. == Medical uses == === Epilepsy === In the United States, the FDA has indicated only one brand of prescription cannabidiol called Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex in people one year of age and older. While Epidiolex treatment is generally well tolerated, it is associated with minor adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal upset, decreased appetite, lethargy, sleepiness, and poor sleep quality. In the European Union, Epidyolex is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome, in conjunction with clobazam, for people two years of age and older. In 2020, the label for Epidiolex in the US was expanded to include seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. Epidiolex/Epidyolex is the first prescription formulation of plant-derived cannabidiol approved by regulatory bodies in the US and Europe. === Other uses === Research on other uses for cannabidiol includes several neurological disorders, but the findings have not been confirmed to establish such uses in clinical practice. In October 2019, the FDA issued an advisory warning that the effects of CBD during pregnancy or breastfeeding are unknown, indicating that the safety, doses, interactions with other drugs or foods, and side effects of CBD are not clinically defined, and may pose a risk to the mother and infant. Many claims are made for the therapeutic benefit of cannabidiol that are not backed by sound evidence. Some claims, such as treatment of cancer, are pseudoscience. In 2020, the label for Epidiolex in the US was expanded to include treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis. Acclaimed for relieving chronic pain, some researchers conclude that the evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of CBD in pain relief, primarily due to the challenging access to pure CBD. CBD oil is used for massage therapy as a substitute for body oil and for its health benefits. === Non-intoxicating effects === Cannabidiol does not appear to have any intoxicating effects such as those caused by ∆9-THC in cannabis, but it is under preliminary research for its possible anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects. As the legal landscape and understanding about the differences in medical cannabinoids unfolds, experts are working to distinguish ""medical cannabis"" (with varying degrees of psychotropic effects and deficits in executive function) from ""medical CBD therapies"", which would commonly present as having a reduced or non-psychoactive side-effect profile. Various strains of ""medical cannabis"" are found to have a significant variation in the ratios of CBD-to-THC and are known to contain other non-psychotropic cannabinoids. Any psychoactive cannabis, regardless of its CBD content, is derived from the flower (or bud) of the genus Cannabis. As defined by US federal law, non-psychoactive hemp (also commonly termed ""industrial hemp""), regardless of its CBD content, is any part of the cannabis plant, whether growing or not, containing a ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of no more than 0.3% on a dry-weight basis. In the United States, certain standards are required for legal growing, cultivating, and producing the hemp plant, but there are no federal standards for quality being enforced in the hemp industry. Certain state regulations are in place, but vary state to state. For instance, the Colorado Industrial Hemp Program registers growers of industrial hemp and samples crops to verify that the dry-weight THC concentration does not exceed 0.3%. === Available forms === CBD is present as an active constituent of cannabis, which is used both recreationally and medically. Nabiximols (brand name Sativex), an oromucosal spray made of a complex botanical mixture containing cannabidiol (CBD), delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and additional cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid constituents from cannabis sativa plants, was approved by Health Canada in 2005, to treat central neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis, and in 2007, for cancer-related pain. In New Zealand, Sativex is ""approved for use as an add-on treatment for symptom improvement in people with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication."" Epidiolex (Epidyolex in Europe) is an orally administered cannabidiol solution. It was approved in 2018 for treatment of two rare forms of childhood epilepsy, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, and seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. In the US, it is approved in these indications for people one year of age and older. == Side effects == Research indicates that cannabidiol may reduce adverse effects of THC, particularly those causing intoxication and sedation, but only at high doses. Safety studies of cannabidiol showed it is well tolerated, but may cause fatigue, somnolence, sedation, diarrhea, or changes in appetite as common adverse effects, with the most common being somnolence and sedation. Side effects of CBD are dose related. Epidiolex documentation lists sleepiness, insomnia and poor quality sleep, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and fatigue. In November 2019, the FDA issued concerns about the safety of cannabidiol, stating that CBD use has potential to cause hepatotoxicity, interfere with the mechanisms of prescription drugs, produce gastrointestinal disorders, or affect alertness and mood. Over 2020–23, the FDA updated its safety concerns about CBD, acknowledging the unknown effects of protracted use, how it affects the developing brain, fetus, or infants during breastfeeding, whether it interacts with dietary supplements or prescription drugs, whether male fertility is affected, and its possible side effects, such as drowsiness. As of September 2019, 1,085 people contacted US poison control centers about CBD-induced illnesses, doubling the number of cases over the 2018 rate and increasing by 9 times the case numbers of 2017. Of cases reported in 2019, more than 33% received medical attention and 46 people were admitted to a hospital intensive care unit, possibly due to exposure to other products, or drug interactions with CBD. In 2022, the FDA stated that ""scientific studies show possible harm to the male reproductive system, including testicular atrophy, harm to the liver, and interactions with certain medications. The FDA has not found adequate information showing how much CBD can be consumed, and for how long, before causing harm. This is particularly true for vulnerable populations like children and those who are pregnant."" == Interactions == Laboratory evidence indicated that cannabidiol may reduce THC clearance, increasing plasma concentrations which may raise THC availability to receptors and enhance its effect in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro, cannabidiol inhibited the activity of voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels, which may affect neural activity. A recent study using X-ray crystallography showed that CBD binds inside the sodium channel pore at a novel site at the interface of the fenestrations and the central hydrophobic cavity of the channel. Binding at this site blocks the transmembrane-spanning sodium ion translocation pathway, providing a molecular mechanism for channel inhibition, which could contribute to a reduced excitability. A small clinical trial reported that CBD partially inhibited the CYP2C-catalyzed hydroxylation of THC to 11-OH-THC. Little is known about potential drug interactions, but CBD mediates a decrease in clobazam metabolism. Work with human liver microsomes shows that cannabidiol inhibits CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 to some degree. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === In vitro, cannabidiol has low affinity for, and acts as a negative allosteric modulator of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor Cannabidiol may be an antagonist of GPR55, a G protein-coupled receptor and putative non-homologous CB3 cannabinoid receptor shown by in vitro studies to be widely distributed in the brain. Cannabidiol may interact with various neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and GABA. As of 2024, the cellular effects and mechanisms of cannabidiol in vivo are unknown, as research to date has been inconclusive and based on laboratory studies. The anticonvulsant effects provided by cannabidiol (Epidiolex) in people with certain forms of epilepsy do not appear to involve cannabinoid receptors. A possible mechanism for the effects of cannabidiol on seizures is by affecting the neuronal movement of calcium in brain structures involved in the excessive electrical activity of seizures. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of cannabidiol is approximately 6% in fasting state and 36.5—57.3% in fed-state in humans, while its bioavailability via inhalation is 11 to 45% (mean 31%). The oral bioavailability of cannabidiol varies based on several factors such as formulation, dose, and food intake. The sublingual bioavailability of cannabidiol is approximately 12 to 35%. The elimination half-life of cannabidiol in blood is 56 to 61 hours after oral doses twice per day over 7 days. Based on the pharmacokinetic analysis of long-term dosing of cannabidiol in humans, the terminal elimination half-life is estimated to be >134 h. Cannabidiol is metabolized in the liver as well as in the intestines by cytochrome P450 enzymes. == Chemistry == At room temperature, cannabidiol is a colorless crystalline solid. In strongly basic media and the presence of air, it is oxidized to cannabinodiol (CBND) and a quinone called HU-331. Under acidic conditions it cyclizes to THC, which also occurs during pyrolysis, and during smoking. The synthesis of cannabidiol has been accomplished by several research groups. === Overview === === Biosynthesis === Cannabis produces CBD through the same metabolic pathway as THC, until the next to last step, where CBDA synthase performs catalysis instead of THCA synthase. === Isomerism === === Pyrolysis === In the typical operating temperature range of e-cigarettes (250–400 °C (482–752 °F)), 25–52% of CBD is transformed into other chemical substances: Δ9-THC, Δ8-THC, cannabinol and cannabichromene as predominant pyrolysates. From a chemical point of view, CBD in e-cigarettes can be considered a precursor of THC. === Synthetic derivatives === Numerous synthetic derivatives of CBD are known, and have been researched for generally similar applications as CBD itself. == History == Efforts to isolate the active ingredients in cannabis were made in the 19th century. Cannabidiol was studied in 1940 from Minnesota wild hemp and Egyptian Cannabis indica resin. The chemical formula of CBD was proposed from a method for isolating it from wild hemp. Its structure and stereochemistry were determined in 1963. === Plant breeding === Selective breeding of cannabis plants has expanded and diversified as commercial and therapeutic markets develop. Some growers in the US succeeded in lowering the proportion of CBD-to-THC to accommodate customers who preferred varietals that were more mind-altering due to the higher THC and lower CBD content. In the US, hemp is classified by the federal government as cannabis containing no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. This classification was established in the 2018 Farm Bill and was refined to include hemp-sourced extracts, cannabinoids, and derivatives in the definition of hemp. == Society and culture == === Names === Cannabidiol is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name. === Foods and beverages === Food and beverage products containing cannabidiol were widely marketed in the United States as early as 2017. Hemp seed ingredients which do not naturally contain THC or CBD (but which may be contaminated with trace amounts on the outside during harvesting) were declared by the US Food and Drug Administration as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in December 2018. CBD itself has not been declared GRAS, and under US federal law is illegal to sell as a food, dietary supplement, or animal feed. State laws vary considerably as non-medical cannabis and derived products have been legalized in various jurisdictions. Despite once having a promising market, the industry for CBD stalled out during the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020, and, by 2024, it collapsed due to withdrawal of investors, the absence of a FDA ruling on efficacy and safety, inconsistent state-by-state legislation, and consumer ambivalence. Similar to energy drinks and protein bars which may contain vitamin or herbal additives, food and beverage items can be infused with CBD as an alternative means of ingesting the substance. In the United States, numerous products are marketed as containing CBD, but in reality contain little or none. Some companies marketing CBD-infused food products with claims that are similar to the effects of prescription drugs have received warning letters from the FDA for making unsubstantiated health claims. In February 2019, the New York City Department of Health announced plans to fine restaurants that sell food or drinks containing CBD, beginning in October 2019. === Labeling and advertising === Studies conducted by the FDA from 2014 through 2019 have determined that a majority of CBD products are not accurately labeled with the amount of CBD they contain. For example, a 2017 analysis of cannabidiol content in oil, tincture, or liquid vape products purchased online in the United States showed that 69% were mislabeled, with 43% having higher and 26% having lower content than stated on product labels. In 2020, the FDA conducted a study of 147 CBD products and found that half contained THC. From 2015 to November 2022, the FDA issued dozens of warning letters to American manufacturers of CBD products for false advertising and illegal interstate marketing of CBD as an unapproved drug to treat diseases, such as cancer, osteoarthritis, symptoms of opioid withdrawal, Alzheimer's disease, and pet disorders. Chemical analysis of CBD products found that many did not contain the levels of CBD claimed in advertising. In December 2020, the Federal Trade Commission initiated a law enforcement crackdown on American companies marketing CBD products as unapproved drugs. The warning also applied to hemp CBD capsules and oil that were being marketed illegally while not adhering to the federal definition of a dietary supplement. === Sports === Cannabidiol has been used by professional and amateur athletes across disciplines and countries, with the World Anti-Doping Agency removing CBD from its banned substances list. The United States Anti-Doping Agency and United Kingdom-Anti-Doping Agency do not have anti-CBD policies, with the latter stating that, ""CBD is not currently listed on the World Anti-Doping Agency Prohibited List. As a result, it is permitted to use in sport, though the intended benefits are unclear and not backed by clinical evidence. All other cannabinoids (including but not limited to cannabis, hashish, marijuana, and THC) are prohibited in-competition. The intention of the regulations is to prohibit cannabinoids that activate the same receptors in the brain as activated by THC."" In 2019, the cannabis manufacturer Canopy Growth acquired majority ownership of BioSteel Sports Nutrition, which is developing CBD products under endorsement by numerous professional athletes. The National Hockey League Alumni Association began a project with Canopy Growth to determine if CBD or other cannabis products might improve neurological symptoms and quality of life in head-injured players. Some sports leagues have announced sponsorships with CBD companies, such as Major League Baseball (Charlotte's Web) and Ultimate Fighting Championship (Love Hemp). Numerous professional athletes use CBD, primarily for treating pain. === Legal status === ==== Australia ==== Prescription medicine (Schedule 4) for therapeutic use containing two percent (2.0%) or less of other cannabinoids commonly found in cannabis (such as ∆9-THC). A Schedule 4 drug under the SUSMP is a Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by state or territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription. In June 2020, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) published a consultation on a proposal to pave the way to make ""low dose"" CBD available to consumer/patients via pharmacists only through moving products from Schedule 4 to 3. Any products sold would need to have their safety, quality and efficacy pre-assessed by the TGA and be formally approved for sale (details to be outlined by TGA). They would be made available to over 18s only, with the maximum daily dose of 60 mg/day, up to 2% THC finished product allowed, 30-day maximum supply, plant-derived or synthetic. This proposal is based on an initial literature review on the safety of low dose CBD published by the TGA in April 2020. Epidyolex was approved for the adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome or with Dravet syndrome in September 2020. ==== Bulgaria ==== In 2020, Bulgaria became the first country in the European Union to allow retail sales of food products and supplements containing CBD, despite the ongoing discussion within the EU about the classification of CBD as a novel food. However, there exists a legal gap because of the lack of a legally-permissible minimum amount of THC in the products containing cannabinoids. ==== Canada ==== In October 2018, cannabidiol became legal for recreational and medical use by the federal Cannabis Act. As of August 2019, CBD products in Canada could only be sold by authorized retailers or federally licensed medical companies, limiting their access to the general public. Nonetheless, with online delivery services and over 2,600 authorized cannabis retail stores as of October 2021, accessibility has steadily increased over time. The Canadian government states that CBD products ""are subject to all of the rules and requirements that apply to cannabis under the Cannabis Act and its regulations."" It requires ""a processing licence to manufacture products containing CBD for sale, no matter what the source of the CBD is, and that CBD and products containing CBD, such as cannabis oil, may only be sold by an authorized retailer or licensed seller of medical CBD."" Edible CBD products were scheduled to be permitted for sale in Canada on October 17, 2019, for human consumption. As of August 2020, it was still illegal to carry cannabis and cannabis-derived products (including products containing CBD) across the Canadian border. If one carries any amount of cannabis for any purpose (including medical), it needs to be declared to the Canada Border Services Agency. Not declaring it is a serious criminal offence. ==== Czech Republic ==== As of May 2023, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection of the Czech Republic is putting together broad regulations regarding a ban on CBD products. They will make it illegal to sell products containing cannabidiol and other cannabinoids derived from hemp, as a result of EU Novel Food Regulation. In case of Czech Republic, European Industrial Hemp Association has submitted an official request to the Czech Republic to recognize natural hemp extracts with cannabinoids as traditional food. ==== European Union ==== In 2019, the European Commission announced that CBD and other cannabinoids would be classified as ""novel foods"", meaning that CBD products would require authorization under the EU Novel Food Regulation stating that because ""this product was not used as a food or food ingredient before May 15, 1997, before it may be placed on the market in the EU as a food or food ingredient, a safety assessment under the Novel Food Regulation is required."" The recommendation – applying to CBD extracts, synthesized CBD, and all CBD products, including CBD oil – was scheduled for a final ruling by the European Commission in March 2019. If approved, manufacturers of CBD products would be required to conduct safety tests and prove safe consumption, indicating that CBD products would not be eligible for legal commerce until at least 2021. In December 2020, the European Commission concluded that CBD should not be considered as drug and can be qualified as food. Cannabidiol is listed in the EU Cosmetics Ingredient Database (CosIng). However, the listing of an ingredient, assigned with an INCI name, in CosIng does not mean it is to be used in cosmetic products or is approved for such use. Several industrial hemp varieties can be legally cultivated in Western Europe. A variety such as ""Fedora 17"" has a cannabinoid profile consistently around 1%, with THC less than 0.3%. ==== Hong Kong ==== In 2022, the HKSAR Government proposed a ban on any use of cannabidiol (including for academic research and by medical professionals) within the Hong Kong territory, making Hong Kong the first jurisdiction in the world to have complete prohibition of cannabidiol, starting from February 1, 2023, in part due to the possible presence of THC which is illegal in Hong Kong, according to a research subsidized by the Hong Kong SAR Government. ==== New Zealand ==== In 2017, the New Zealand government made changes to the regulations so that restrictions would be removed, which meant a doctor was able to prescribe cannabidiol to patients. The passing of the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Act in December 2018 means cannabidiol is no longer a controlled drug in New Zealand, but is a prescription medicine under the Medicines Act, with the restriction that ""the tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs) and specified substances within the product must not exceed 2 percent of the total CBD, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other specified substances."" ==== Russian Federation ==== According to a document received in response to an appeal to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, measures of state control in the Russian Federation regarding CBD have not been established. However, there is also a response from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation indicating that CBD can be considered as an isomer of restricted THC. The ""isomer"" argument is nonetheless vague, as progesterone, which is freely sold in pharmacies, is also an isomer of THC, all three being C21H30O2. On February 17, 2020, the deputy of the Moscow City Duma Darya Besedina sent an official request to the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Mishustin with a request to eliminate that legal ambiguity by publishing official explanations and, if necessary, making required changes in the corresponding government decree. ==== Singapore ==== Singapore allows medical cannabis on a case-by-case basis, usually as a last resort drug. Each case is evaluated by the government, and largely comes in the form of Cannabidiol. However, the country is flexible to what is required for patient treatment, despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world. ==== Sweden ==== Cannabidiol is classified as a medical product in Sweden. However, in July 2019, Supreme Court of Sweden ruled that CBD oil with any concentration of THC falls under the narcotic control laws. ==== Switzerland ==== While THC remains illegal, cannabidiol is not subject to the Swiss Narcotic Acts because it does not produce a comparable psychoactive effect. Cannabis products containing less than 1% THC can be sold and purchased legally. ==== Ukraine ==== On April 7, 2021, the Ukrainian government legalised use of isolated cannabidiol. Additionally, it approved Nabiximols, a cannabidiol-containing drug, for medical use. ==== United Kingdom ==== Cannabidiol, in an oral-mucosal spray formulation combined with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is a product available by prescription for the relief of severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (where other anti-spasmodics have not been effective) in the United Kingdom. Until 2017, products containing cannabidiol marketed for medical purposes were classed as medicines by the UK regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and could not be marketed without regulatory approval for the medical claims. As of 2018, cannabis oil is legal to possess, buy, and sell in the UK, providing the product does not contain more than 1 milligram of THC and is not advertised as providing a medicinal benefit. Individual police officers and others who are ill-informed of the exact legislature pertaining to cannabidiol, however, may erroneously consider it of dubious legality, reflecting lack of awareness. In January 2019, the UK Food Standards Agency indicated it would regard CBD products, including CBD oil, as a novel food having no history of use before May 1997, and stated that such products must have authorisation and proven safety before being marketed. The deadline for companies with existing products to submit a full and validated novel foods application with the FSA was March 31, 2021; failure to do so before this date would exclude those companies from selling CBD. New products containing CBD after this deadline would require a fully approved application. In February 2020, the UK FSA advised vulnerable people, such as pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and those already taking medication for other medical concerns not to take CBD. The FSA further recommended that healthy adults should not consume more than 70 mg CBD per day. ==== United Nations ==== Cannabidiol is scheduled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs as cannabis. International Narcotics Control Board reminds Member States that, at the reconvened sixty-third session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, in December 2020, the States members of the Commission rejected the recommendation of WHO that a footnote be added to the entry for cannabis and cannabis resin in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended to exempt from international control preparations containing predominantly CBD and not more than 0.2 per cent of delta-9-THC. ==== United States ==== As of 2023, cannabidiol extracted from marijuana remains a Schedule I Controlled Substance, and is not approved as a prescription drug or dietary supplement or allowed for interstate commerce in the United States. CBD derived from hemp (with 0.3% THC or lower) is legal to sell as a cosmetics ingredient or for other purposes not regulated by the FDA, but cannot be sold under federal law as an ingredient in food, dietary supplement, or animal feed. It is a common misconception that the legal ability to sell hemp (which may contain CBD), and hemp extracts and derivatives (including CBD), makes CBD legal for sale as a supplement or medicine. In September 2018, the GW Pharmaceuticals drug Epidiolex was placed in Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), following its approval by the FDA for rare types of childhood epilepsy. It was then removed from the Controlled Substances Act by the DEA in April 2020. Epidiolex is available for prescription use in all 50 states. In 2013, a CNN program that featured Charlotte's Web cannabis brought increased attention to the use of CBD for the treatment of seizure disorders in children. A number of states passed laws over the next few years to allow the use of low-THC, high-CBD cannabis oil in such situations. These states were in addition to the states that had already legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. Many states further relaxed their laws regarding CBD following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. The 2014 Farm Bill legalized the sale of ""non-viable hemp material"" grown within states participating in the Hemp Pilot Program which defined hemp as cannabis containing less than 0.3% of THC. The 2018 Farm Bill removed the hemp plant and all ""derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis,"" including CBD, from the Controlled Substances Act, making them legal to manufacture in the United States. The FDA retains regulatory authority over hemp-derived CBD, while the DEA is not involved in the regulation of legally-compliant hemp and hemp products. The 2018 Farm Bill requires that research and development of CBD for a therapeutic purpose would have to be conducted under notification and reporting to the FDA. == Veterinary use == === Research === The number of research projects and scientific publications on cannabidiol and other cannabinoids in pets surged in the late 2010s; nonetheless, as of December 2020, there were no hemp-derived, cannabinoid-rich registered veterinary medicinal products in any of the major regions (see #Legal status). In the US and other territories there are, however, numerous veterinary nutraceutical products available over the counter (OTC). The lack of clarity in the regulations governing veterinary hemp food supplements allows for products of questionable quality to flood the market, which may pose a risk to the wellbeing of pets and owners. To understand better the benefits of CBD and associated compounds for the quality of life of animals, companies specialized in CBD products for animals have been funding research projects. === Canine osteoarthritis === CBD's ability to help regulate the endocannabinoid system and reduce the release of excitatory neurotransmitters could result in a retrograde inhibitory signal that lessens chronic pain responses. Studies in dogs with chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis showed an increase in level of activity in animals receiving CBD-rich food supplements. === Epilepsy === From the results seen in humans with drugs such as Epidiolex and Sativex in scientific studies and reviews, it could be expected that CBD-based products would be helpful to manage seizures in dogs. However, despite the numerous case reports presented by veterinary neurologists supporting the benefits of CBD as adjunctive therapy, as of December 2020, published controlled studies have not shown a statistically significant decrease in the number of seizures across the groups receiving CBD. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of CBD varies greatly across species and it is linked to the presentation and the time of administration. A 24-hour kinetic examination in dogs showed that the absorption of the cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) does occur, and that this molecule is absorbed least twice as well as CBD post oral ingestion. It was found that the major metabolites of CBD in humans (7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD) are not prevalent in dogs, while 6-OH-CBD was found to be the primary metabolite in dogs receiving a CBD-enriched cannabis-derived herbal extract, suggesting that canine and human CBD metabolic route might be somewhat different. == Research == As of 2022, little evidence exists for cannabidiol reducing psychiatric disorders in humans. In the United States, federal illegality complicates conducting historic research on CBD. == References == == Further reading =="	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	{'MED': -6.704273e-07, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07, ',': -0.00015478976, ' PERSON': -0.14961423, 'AL': -1.9361265e-07, ' CARE': 0.0}
254	12,13-dihome	PUBMED	 Circulating factors released from tissues during exercise have been hypothesized to mediate some of the health benefits of regular physical activity. Lipokines are circulating lipid species that have recently been reported to affect metabolism in response to cold. Here, lipidomics analysis revealed that a bout of moderate-intensity exercise causes a pronounced increase in the circulating lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-diHOME) in male, female, young, old, sedentary, and active human subjects. In mice, both a single bout of exercise and exercise training increased circulating 12,13-diHOME and surgical removal of brown adipose tissue (BAT) negated the increase in 12,13-diHOME, suggesting that BAT is the tissue source for exercise-stimulated 12,13-diHOME. Acute 12,13-diHOME treatment of mice in vivo increased skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake and oxidation, but not glucose uptake. These data reveal that lipokines are novel exercise-stimulated circulating factors that may contribute to the metabolic changes that occur with physical exercise. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige adipose tissue combust fuels for heat production in adult humans, and so constitute an appealing target for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Cold exposure can enhance energy expenditure by activating BAT, and it has been shown to improve nutrient metabolism. These therapies, however, are time consuming and uncomfortable, demonstrating the need for pharmacological interventions. Recently, lipids have been identified that are released from tissues and act locally or systemically to promote insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance; as a class, these lipids are referred to as 'lipokines'. Because BAT is a specialized metabolic tissue that takes up and burns lipids and is linked to systemic metabolic homeostasis, we hypothesized that there might be thermogenic lipokines that activate BAT in response to cold. Here we show that the lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-diHOME) is a stimulator of BAT activity, and that its levels are negatively correlated with body-mass index and insulin sensitivity. Using a global lipidomic analysis, we found that 12,13-diHOME was increased in the circulation of humans and mice exposed to cold. Furthermore, we found that the enzymes that produce 12,13-diHOME were uniquely induced in BAT by cold stimulation. The injection of 12,13-diHOME acutely activated BAT fuel uptake and enhanced cold tolerance, which resulted in decreased levels of serum triglycerides. Mechanistically, 12,13-diHOME increased fatty acid (FA) uptake into brown adipocytes by promoting the translocation of the FA transporters FATP1 and CD36 to the cell membrane. These data suggest that 12,13-diHOME, or a functional analog, could be developed as a treatment for metabolic disorders. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an important tissue for thermogenesis, making it a potential target to decrease the risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and recent studies have also identified BAT as an endocrine organ. Although BAT has been implicated to be protective in cardiovascular disease, to this point there are no studies that identify a direct role for BAT to mediate cardiac function. To determine the role of BAT on cardiac function, we utilized a model of BAT transplantation. We then performed lipidomics and identified an increase in the lipokine 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-diHOME). We utilized a mouse model with sustained overexpression of 12,13-diHOME and investigated the role of 12,13-diHOME in a nitric oxide synthase type 1 deficient (NOS1 Here, we determined that transplantation of BAT (+BAT) improves cardiac function via the release of the lipokine 12,13-diHOME. Sustained overexpression of 12,13-diHOME using tissue nanotransfection negated the deleterious effects of a high-fat diet on cardiac function and remodeling, and acute injection of 12,13-diHOME increased cardiac hemodynamics via direct effects on the cardiomyocyte. Furthermore, incubation of cardiomyocytes with 12,13-diHOME increased mitochondrial respiration. The effects of 12,13-diHOME were absent in  Our results identify an endocrine role for BAT to enhance cardiac function that is mediated by regulation of calcium cycling via 12,13-diHOME and NOS1.

258	Losartan	WIKIPEDIA	"Losartan, sold under the brand name Cozaar among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It is in the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) family of medication, and is considered protective of the kidneys. Besides hypertension, it is also used in diabetic kidney disease, heart failure, and left ventricular enlargement. It comes as a tablet that is taken by mouth. It may be used alone or in addition to other blood pressure medication. Up to six weeks may be required for the full effects to occur. Common adverse effects include muscle cramps, stuffy nose, dizziness, cough, high blood potassium, and anemia. Severe adverse effects may include angioedema, low blood pressure, and kidney problems. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Use is not recommended during breastfeeding. It works by blocking angiotensin II. Losartan was patented in 1986, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the eighth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 53 million prescriptions. A version combined with hydrochlorothiazide is available which, in 2022, was the 75th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Chemistry == Losartan potassium is chemically described as 2-butyl-4-chloro-1-[p-(o-1H-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl]imidazole-5-methanol monopotassium salt. Its empirical formula is C22H23CIKN6O , and its molecular weight is 422.9. Losartan is generally marketed as the (basic) potassium salt of the aromatized negatively charged tetrazole, called ""losartan potassium"". The molecule has an extended biphenyl group with a tetrazole which is being used in place of the carboxylic acid as a bioisostere. == Medical uses == Losartan is used for hypertension, including in people with left ventricular hypertrophy (enlarged heart muscle), and kidney dysfunction among type II diabetics. It may also delay progression of diabetic nephropathy. It is a suitable pharmacological agent for the reduction of renal disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria (>30 mg/24 hours) or proteinuria (>900 mg/24 hours). Although evidence shows calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-line treatments for most people (due to both efficacy and cost), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist such as losartan is recommended as first-line treatment in people under the age of 55 who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor. One study demonstrated losartan was superior to atenolol in the primary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke), with a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for a comparable reduction in blood pressure. The maximal effects on blood pressure usually occur within 3–6 weeks of starting losartan. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects for losartan in adults are upper respiratory infections, dizziness, and back pain. People with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease may experience diarrhea, fatigue, low blood pressure, low blood glucose, elevated potassium, chest pain, or allergic reaction. Losartan should not be taken by people who are diabetic and taking aliskiren. Anemia may occur, due to inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system. As with other angiotensin receptor blockers, losartan may injure the liver, although this effect appears to be rare. Electrolyte imbalances may occur in people with kidney problems who take losartan. Adverse outcomes do not differ by sex, age, or race. === Pregnancy === In October 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning that losartan can cause fetal toxicity￼ and should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is detected. Using losartan while pregnant could result in fetal injury or death. === Overdose === Overdosing would most likely result in decreased blood pressure, which could manifest as an increased heart rate, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, or loss of consciousness. Mice studies showed that lethality occurred at about 44 to 170 times the maximum recommended dose after the mice weights were taken into account. === Interactions === Losartan may have adverse interactions with phenobarbital, rifampin, or fluconazole, possibly inhibiting its blood pressure-lowering effects. === Contamination === Between November 2018 and September 2019, the FDA announced multiple recalls of tablets containing losartan by Sandoz, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Hetero Labs, Camber Pharmaceuticals, Legacy Pharmaceutical Packaging, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Vivimed Life Sciences, and Macleods Pharmaceutical Limited due to detection of one of the possible carcinogens N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-methylnitrosobutyric acid, or N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). == Mechanism of action == Losartan is a selective, competitive angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonist, reducing the end organ responses to angiotensin II. Losartan administration results in a decrease in total peripheral resistance (afterload) and cardiac venous return (preload). All of the physiological effects of angiotensin II, including the release of aldosterone, are antagonized in the presence of losartan. Reduction in blood pressure occurs independently of the status of the renin–angiotensin system. As a result of losartan dosing, plasma renin activity increases due to the removal of the angiotensin II feedback. Renin is released from the kidneys when there is reduced renal arterial pressure, sympathetic activation, or increased sodium delivery to the distal renal tubule. Renin then acts by converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II; angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and aldosterone release. Aldosterone serves to retain sodium from the distal renal tubule. Sodium retention ultimately results in increased blood pressure. Therefore, the use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists like losartan results in blocking the downstream effect of renin, and angiotensin II, and ultimately decreasing blood pressure. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists include losartan, valsartan, azilsartan, candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, and telmisartan. They all have the same mechanism of action and potentially inhibit the actions of angiotensin better than ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril, because other enzymes than ACE have the capability of producing angiotensin II. Losartan is a uricosuric. As a specific inhibitor of the urate transporter 1 (SLC22A12, URAT1), losartan blocks the uptake of uric acid into cells, thus leaving more available in the bloodstream to be filtered and excreted by the kidneys. Because losartan can cause hyperkalemia, individuals should not use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without appropriate monitoring by a physician. == Pharmacokinetics == Losartan is well absorbed following oral administration and undergoes significant first-pass metabolism to produce the 5-carboxylic acid metabolite, designated as EXP3174. About 14% of an oral dosage is converted to this metabolite, which is long-acting (6 to 8 hours) and a noncompetitive antagonist at the AT1 receptor, contributing to the pharmacological effects of losartan. EXP3174 is 10–40 times more potent in blocking AT1 receptors than losartan. In addition, the binding to the target enzyme is pH-sensitive, and the negatively charged tetrazole ring, which is similar in size to the negative carboxylic acid derivative, may contribute to the activity of the drug. Losartan's bioavailability is about 33%. Metabolism is primarily by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Peak plasma concentrations of losartan and EXP3174 occur about one hour and three to four hours, respectively, after an oral dose. Both losartan and EXP3174 are more than 98% bound to plasma proteins. Losartan is excreted in the urine, and in the feces via bile, as unchanged drug and metabolites. About 4% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine, and about 6% is excreted in urine as the active metabolite. The terminal elimination half-lives of losartan and EXP3174 are about 1.5 to 2.5 hours and 3 to 9 hours, respectively. Losartan and other angiotensin-receptor antagonists exhibit fetal toxicity and should be avoided during pregnancy, particularly in the second and third trimesters. == History == == References == == Further reading == Al-Majed AR, Assiri E, Khalil NY, Abdel-Aziz HA (2015).

265	Amiodarone	WIKIPEDIA	"Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication used to treat and prevent a number of types of cardiac dysrhythmias. This includes ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and wide complex tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Evidence in cardiac arrest, however, is poor. It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously. When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin. Common side effects include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation. As amiodarone can have serious side effects, it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias. Serious side effects include lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death. If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding it can cause problems in the fetus or the infant. It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication. It works partly by increasing the time before a heart cell can contract again. Amiodarone was first made in 1961 and came into medical use in 1962 for chest pain believed to be related to the heart. It was pulled from the market in 1967 due to side effects. In 1974 it was found to be useful for arrhythmias and reintroduced. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 237th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amiodarone has been used both in the treatment of acute life-threatening arrhythmias as well as the long-term suppression of arrhythmias. Amiodarone is commonly used to treat different types of abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial arrhythmias (supraventricular arrhythmias) and ventricular arrhythmias. Atrial arrhythmias and supraventricular arrhythmias are terms often used interchangeably to refer to abnormal heart rhythms originating from the upper chambers of the heart, known as the atria. These types of arrhythmias include conditions such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. They are collectively referred to as supraventricular or atrial arrhythmias because they occur above (supra) the ventricles in the electrical conduction system of the heart. Ventricular arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that originate in the ventricles, which are the lower chambers of the heart. These arrhythmias can be potentially life-threatening and may disrupt the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Amiodarone can be effective in treating conditions like ventricular fibrillation (a rapid and irregular heartbeat), ventricular tachycardia (fast heartbeat originating from the lower chambers), and cardiac arrest due to shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation. In cases where a patient is experiencing shock-resistant ventricular arrhythmias including stable ventricular tachycardia or unstable ventricular fibrillation, amiodarone may be used. A recent study suggested that another antiarrhythmic, procainamide, may be more effective in stopping ventricular tachycardia – with less side effects and a higher survival rate in patients requiring multiple shocks. However, due to a small sample size and lack of statistical significance, more evidence is required, and amiodarone remains the drug of choice in ventricular arrhythmias. Amiodarone is also commonly used as the first-line therapy for patients who receive shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators caused by ventricular arrhythmias. Combining amiodarone with beta-blockers has been shown to reduce the likelihood of experiencing inappropriate shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators. === Cardiac arrest === Defibrillation is the treatment of choice for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia resulting in cardiac arrest. While amiodarone has been used in shock-refractory cases, evidence of benefit is poor. Although amiodarone does not appear to improve survival in those who had a cardiac arrest in-hospital, some studies suggested that early administration of amiodarone was associated with better survival and positive outcomes for people who had a cardiac arrest out-of-hospital. === Ventricular tachycardia === Amiodarone may be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in certain instances. Individuals with hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia should not initially receive amiodarone. These individuals should be cardioverted. Amiodarone can be used in individuals with hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia. In these cases, amiodarone can be used regardless of the individual's underlying heart function and the type of ventricular tachycardia; it can be used in individuals with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, but is contraindicated in individuals with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia as it is associated with a prolonged QT interval which will be made worse with anti-arrhythmic drugs. === Atrial fibrillation === Individuals who have undergone open heart surgery are at an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (or AF) in the first few days post-procedure. In the ARCH trial, intravenous amiodarone (2 g administered over 2 d) has been shown to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery when compared to placebo. However, clinical studies have failed to demonstrate long-term efficacy and have shown potentially fatal side effects such as pulmonary toxicities. While amiodarone is not approved for AF by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is a commonly prescribed off-label treatment due to the lack of equally effective treatment alternatives. So-called 'acute onset atrial fibrillation', defined by the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) in 2003, responds well to short-duration treatment with amiodarone. This has been demonstrated in seventeen randomized controlled trials, of which five included a placebo arm. The incidence of severe side effects in this group is low. Amiodarone is an effective, antiarrhythmic-of-choice in achieving cardioversion to sinus rhythm in critical care populations with new onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF). However, other anti-arrhythmic agents may exert superior rhythm control, rate control and lower mortality rate which may be more favourable than amiodarone in specific cases. == Contraindications == Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant are strongly advised not to take amiodarone. Since amiodarone can be expressed in breast milk, women taking the drug are advised to stop nursing. It is contraindicated in individuals with sinus nodal bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and second or third-degree heart block who do not have an artificial pacemaker. Individuals with baseline depressed lung function should be monitored closely if amiodarone therapy is to be initiated. Formulations of amiodarone that contain benzyl alcohol should not be given to neonates, because the benzyl alcohol may cause the potentially fatal ""gasping syndrome"". Amiodarone can worsen the cardiac arrhythmia brought on by digitalis toxicity. Contraindications of amiodarone also include: hypersensitivity to amiodarone or any of its components; severe hepatic impairment; sinus node dysfunction, including severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block, since amiodarone can cause significant bradycardia and sinus nodal arrest; second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, due to its negative chronotropic (affecting the heart rate) and dromotropic (affecting the conductivity) effects on the AV conduction system, unless a pacemaker is implanted; thyrotoxicosis that cannot be controlled by conventional means, such as Graves' disease. There are no specific guidelines for endurance or high-intensity exercise while taking amiodarone. However, since amiodarone may cause bradycardia and QTc prolongation which can affect exercise capacity and increase the risk of arrhythmias during intense exercise, it would generally be advisable for patients taking this medication to consult their healthcare provider before engaging in high-intensity physical activities such as strenuous endurance exercises. == Side effects == At oral doses of 400 mg per day or higher, amiodarone can have serious, varied side effects, including toxicity to the thyroid gland, liver, lung, and retinal functions, requiring clinical surveillance and regular laboratory testing. Allergic reactions to amiodarone may occur. Most individuals administered amiodarone on a chronic basis will experience at least one side effect. In some people, daily use of amiodarone at 100 mg oral doses can be effective for arrhythmia control with no or minimal side effects. Some common side effects include: nausea and vomiting; taste disturbances (changes in taste perception, often described as a metallic or bitter taste in the mouth); photosensitivity of the skin, also known as photodermatitis, where exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation may lead to skin reactions such as rashes or sunburn-like symptoms; corneal microdeposits (deposits may accumulate on the cornea over time, resulting in blurred vision or visual halos—bright circles or rings around a light source, such as headlights; still, these corneal deposits typically do not affect vision significantly); thyroid dysfunction (in approximately 15-20% of patients, amiodarone treatment results in thyroid dysfunction, either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis; the drug can lead to both hypo- and hyperthyroidism); pulmonary toxicity (lung problems such as pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease may occur rarely but have the potential for serious consequences if left untreated); liver abnormalities (liver damage, including elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) and hepatotoxicity, although severe cases are rare); bradycardia and heart block (since it slows down heart rate by affecting the sinus node function and AV conduction system, it can increase the risk of heart block); QT Interval prolongation. Amiodarone can potentially cause renal toxicity, but solid studies on whether amiodarone may be toxic to the kidneys are lacking. === Lung === Side effects of oral amiodarone at doses of 400 mg or higher include various pulmonary effects. The most serious reaction is interstitial lung disease. Risk factors include high cumulative dose, more than 400 milligrams per day, duration over two months, increased age, and preexisting pulmonary disease. Some individuals were noted to develop pulmonary fibrosis after a week of treatment, while others did not develop it after years of continuous use. Common practice is to avoid the agent if possible in individuals with decreased lung function. The most specific test of pulmonary toxicity due to amiodarone is a dramatically decreased DLCO noted on pulmonary function testing. === Thyroid === Induced abnormalities in thyroid function are common. In approximately 15-20% of patients, amiodarone treatment results in thyroid dysfunction, either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Both under- and overactivity of the thyroid may occur. Amiodarone is structurally similar to thyroxine and also contains iodine. Both of these factors contribute to the effects of amiodarone on thyroid function. Amiodarone also causes an anti-thyroid action, via Plummer and Wolff–Chaikoff effects, due its large amount of iodine in its molecule, which causes a particular ""cardiac hypothyroidism"" with bradycardia and arrhythmia. Thyroid function should be checked at least every six months. Hypothyroidism (slowing of the thyroid) occurs frequently; in the SAFE trial, which compared amiodarone with other medications for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, biochemical hypothyroidism (as defined by a TSH level of 4.5–10 mU/L) occurred in 25.8% of the amiodarone-treated group as opposed to 6.6% of the control group (taking placebo or sotalol). Overt hypothyroidism (defined as TSH >10 mU/L) occurred at 5.0% compared to 0.3%; most of these (>90%) were detected within the first six months of amiodarone treatment. Amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT), can be caused due to the high iodine content in the drug via the Jod-Basedow effect. This is known as Type 1 AIT, and usually occurs in patients with an underlying predisposition to hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease, within weeks to months after starting amiodarone. Type 1 AIT is usually treated with anti-thyroid drugs or thyroidectomy. Type 2 AIT is caused by a destructive thyroiditis due to a direct toxic effect of amiodarone on thyroid follicular epithelial cells. Type 2 AIT can occur even years after starting amiodarone, is usually self-limited and responds to anti-inflammatory treatment such as corticosteroids. In practice, often the type of AIT is undetermined or presumed as mixed with both treatments combined. Thyroid uptake measurements (I-123 or I-131), which are used to differentiate causes of hyperthyroidism, are generally unreliable in patients who have been taking amiodarone. Because of the high iodine content of amiodarone, the thyroid gland is effectively saturated, thus preventing further uptake of isotopes of iodine. However, positive radioactive iodine can be used to rule in type 1AIT . === Eye === Corneal micro-deposits (cornea verticillata, also called vortex or whorl keratopathy) are almost universally present (over 90%) in individuals taking amiodarone longer than 6 months, especially doses greater than 400 mg/day. These deposits typically do not cause any symptoms. About 1 in 10 individuals may complain of a bluish halo. Anterior subcapsular lens deposits are relatively common (50%) in higher doses (greater than 600 mg/day) after 6 months of treatment. Optic neuropathy, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (N-AION), occurs in 1–2% of people and is not dosage dependent. Bilateral optic disc swelling and mild and reversible visual field defects can also occur. Loss of eyelashes has been linked to amiodarone use. === Liver === Abnormal liver enzyme results are common in people taking amiodarone. Much rarer are jaundice, hepatomegaly (liver enlargement), and hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). In clinical observations, it has been noted that the administration of amiodarone, even at lower therapeutic doses, has been associated with the development of a condition mimicking alcoholic cirrhosis. This condition, often referred to as pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis, presents with similar histopathological features to those observed in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. However, this extreme adverse event manifestation—pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis caused by low dose amiodarone—is very rare. === Skin === Long-term administration of amiodarone (usually more than eighteen months) is associated with a light-sensitive blue-grey discoloration of the skin, sometimes called ceruloderma; such patients should avoid exposure to the sun and use sunscreen that protects against ultraviolet-A and -B. The discoloration will slowly improve upon cessation of the medication, however, the skin color may not return completely. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Use during pregnancy may result in a number of problems in the infant including thyroid problems, heart problems, neurological problems, and preterm birth. Use during breastfeeding is generally not recommended though one dose may be okay. === Other === Long-term use of amiodarone has been associated with peripheral neuropathies. Amiodarone is sometimes responsible for epididymitis. Amiodarone accumulates in the head of the organ and can cause unilateral or bilateral inflammation. It tends to resolve if amiodarone is stopped. Some cases of gynecomastia have been reported in men on amiodarone. A retrospective cohort study found an increased risk of digestive, liver, head and neck and liver cancers amongst male patients exposed to amiodarone versus female participants in the same study and the general population. This study also identified that the Standardized Incidence Ratio of cancer occurrence increased significantly in males aged 20-59 and >80 years old who were exposed to a higher dose of Amiodarone in comparison to those exposed to a lower dose. This suggests that there is a dose-effect relationship. These results should be interpreted with caution due to limitations of the study design and care should be taken prior to altering current clinical and prescribing practices. Amiodarone and its effect on cancer is still a topic that requires more robust research. == Drug-drug interactions == The pharmacokinetics of numerous drugs, including many that are commonly administered to individuals with heart disease, are affected by amiodarone. Amiodarone has particularly important interactions with the following drugs: class I antiarrhythmics (amiodarone should not be combined with other class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, flecainide, procainamide, quinidine, etc., due to an increased risk of QTc prolongation and potential arrhythmias); beta blockers and calcium channel blockers (combining amiodarone with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, such as sotalol, can further slow down heart rate and cause bradycardia or heart block); digoxin (amiodarone inhibits a protein called P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which transports digoxin out of cells in the gut, liver, and kidneys, therefore, concurrent use of these medications increases digoxin levels in the body, potentially leading to digoxin toxicity); statins (amiodarone can inhibit enzymes in the liver responsible for metabolizing certain statins, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, etc., therefore interaction elevates plasma concentrations of these statins, increasing the risk of myopathy, that is muscle damage, or rhabdomyolysis, that is severe muscle breakdown); warfarin (since the anticoagulation effects of warfarin depend on metabolism of warfarin by both cytochromes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, coadministation leads to rise in international normalized ratio (INR)—the amount of time taken for the blood to form a clot—placing patient at higher bleeding risks); Amiodarone potentiates the action of warfarin by inhibiting the clearance of both (S) and (R) warfarin. Individuals taking both of these medications should have their warfarin doses adjusted based on their dosing of amiodarone and have their anticoagulation status (measured as prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR)) measured more frequently. Dose reduction of warfarin is as follows: 40% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 400 mg daily, 35% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 300 mg daily, 30% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 200 mg daily, and 25% reduction if amiodarone dose is 100 mg daily. The effect of amiodarone on the warfarin concentrations can be as early as a few days after initiation of treatment; however, the interaction may not peak for up to seven weeks; anti-HIV medications (several HIV medications, such as ritonavir, indinavir, etc., interact with amiodarone by inhibiting CYP3A4 enzyme hence leading to decreased clearance of amiodarone, i.e., increasing the concentration of amiodarone in the organism). Amiodarone inhibits the action of the cytochrome P450 isozyme family; such inhibition reduces the clearance of many drugs, including the following: ciclosporin, digoxin, flecainide, procainamide, quinidine, sildenafil, simvastatin, theophylline, warfarin. In 2015, Gilead Sciences warned healthcare providers about people who began taking the hepatitis C drugs ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir along with amiodarone, who developed abnormally slow heartbeats or died of cardiac arrest. == Metabolism == Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, therefore, amiodarone and can affect the metabolism of numerous other drugs that depend on cytochrome P450, such as digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, etc. The major metabolite of amiodarone is desethylamiodarone (DEA), which also has antiarrhythmic properties. The metabolism of amiodarone is inhibited by grapefruit, leading to elevated serum levels of amiodarone. On 8 August 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning of the risk of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney failure or death, when simvastatin is used with amiodarone. This interaction is dose-dependent with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg. This drug combination, especially with higher doses of simvastatin, should be avoided. Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary metabolic pathway of amiodarone is by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. The metabolism of amiodaron can be characterized by two phases: phase I metabolism, when amiodarone undergoes oxidative processes mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8; these reactions result in the formation of several active metabolites, including desethylamiodarone (DEA) and di-desethylamiodarone (DDEA); DEA is the most abundant metabolite and exhibits similar pharmacological effects as amiodarone; phase II metabolism, when both amiodarone and its major metabolite DEA can undergo conjugation reactions with glucuronic acid; this process increases water solubility of these compounds for their efficient elimination from the body. Amiodarone has an exceptionally long half-life due to a combination of several factors: high lipid solubility, given that amiodarone has high lipid solubility, which allows it to distribute throughout various tissues in the body rapidly; the extensive tissue distribution of amiodarone contributes to a large volume of distribution that leads to slow clearance from plasma compartments; extensive tissue binding, so that amiodarone extensively binds to different tissues, including fat deposits, muscles, heart tissue, and other organs; this binding creates reservoirs where drug release can occur slowly over time, resulting in an extended duration of action even after stopping the therapy; enterohepatic recycling, meaning that amiodarone undergoes enterohepatic recycling, where it is reabsorbed from the intestines after being excreted into bile, which contributes to its prolonged presence. === Excretion === Excretion is primarily via the liver and the bile duct with almost no elimination via the kidney and it is not dialyzable. Elimination half-life average of 58 days (ranging from 25 to 100 days [Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st edition]) for amiodarone and 36 days for the active metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA). There is 10-50% transfer of amiodarone and DEA in the placenta as well as a presence in breast milk. Accumulation of amiodarone and DEA occurs in adipose tissue and highly perfused organs (i.e. liver, lungs), therefore, if an individual was taking amiodarone on a chronic basis if it is stopped it will remain in the system for weeks to months. Whereas amiodarone is primarily eliminated from the body through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, a very small portion of amiodarone and its metabolites are excreted unchanged in urine or feces. The liver plays a significant role in the elimination of amiodarone. After being extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, amiodarone is transported into bile via multidrug-resistant protein 2 (MRP2) transporter. Bile containing amiodarone and its metabolites is then released into the gastrointestinal tract. Some of these compounds can be reabsorbed back into systemic circulation through enterohepatic recirculation, where they may undergo additional rounds of metabolism before eventually being excreted again into bile. Because renal excretion contributes only minimally to the elimination of amiodarone, dose adjustment based on kidney function is generally not necessary. This is because most patients with normal renal function can adequately clear the drug through hepatic metabolism and biliary elimination pathways. == Pharmacology == Amiodarone is categorized as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, and prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, the repolarization phase where there is normally decreased calcium permeability and increased potassium permeability. It has numerous other effects, however, including actions that are similar to those of antiarrhythmic classes Ia, II, and IV. Amiodarone is a blocker of voltage gated potassium (KCNH2) and voltage gated calcium channels (CACNA2D2). Amiodarone slows the conduction rate and prolongs the refractory period of the SA and AV nodes. It also prolongs the refractory periods of the ventricles, bundles of His, and the Purkinje fibers without exhibiting any effects on the conduction rate. Amiodarone has been shown to prolong the myocardial cell action potential duration and refractory period and is a non-competitive β-adrenergic inhibitor. It also shows beta blocker-like and calcium channel blocker-like actions on the SA and AV nodes, increases the refractory period via sodium- and potassium-channel effects, and slows intra-cardiac conduction of the cardiac action potential, via sodium-channel effects. It is suggested that amiodarone may also exacerbate the phenotype associated with Long QT-3 syndrome causing mutations such as ∆KPQ. This effect is due to a combination of blocking the peak sodium current, but also contributing to an increased persistent sodium current. Amiodarone chemically resembles thyroxine (thyroid hormone), and its binding to the nuclear thyroid receptor might contribute to some of its pharmacologic and toxic actions. The mechanisms of action of amiodarone include blocking potassium ion channels (prolonging repolarization), blocking sodium ion channels, and antagonizing alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. The action of amiodarone can be characterized by the following effects: potassium channel blockade, since amiodarone blocks potassium channels involved in cardiac repolarization during phase 3 of the action potential, so that this blockade prolongs the duration of cardiac action potentials, resulting in an increased refractory period and decreased excitability; sodium channel blockade, characterized by inhibiting sodium ion influx through voltage-gated sodium channels, so that amiodarone reduces the conduction velocity of electrical impulses in cardiac tissue that leads to a slowed heart rate and improved rhythm control; calcium channel blockade, by inhibiting L-type calcium channels in myocardial cells, decreasing intracellular calcium concentration during ventricular contraction; noncompetitive adrenergic receptor antagonism, meaning that amiodarone has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonistic effects, which help reduce sympathetic stimulation on the heart. == History == The original observation that amiodarone's progenitor molecule, khellin, had cardioactive properties, was made by the Russian physiologist Gleb von Anrep while working in Cairo in 1946. Khellin is obtained from a plant extract of Khella or Ammi visnaga, a common plant in north Africa. Anrep noticed that one of his technicians had been cured of anginal symptoms after taking khellin, then used for various, non-cardiac ailments. This led to efforts by European pharmaceutical industries to isolate an active compound. Amiodarone was initially developed in 1961 at the Labaz company, Belgium, by chemists Tondeur and Binon, who were working on preparations derived from khellin. It became popular in Europe as a treatment for angina pectoris. As a doctoral candidate at Oxford University, Bramah Singh determined that amiodarone and sotalol had antiarrhythmic properties and belonged to a new class of antiarrhythmic agents (what would become the class III antiarrhythmic agents). Today the mechanisms of action of amiodarone and sotalol have been investigated in more detail. Both drugs have been demonstrated to prolong the duration of the action potential, prolonging the refractory period, by interacting among other cellular functions with K+ channels. Based on Singh's work, the Argentinian physician Mauricio Rosenbaum began using amiodarone to treat his patients who have supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, with impressive results. Based on papers written by Rosenbaum developing Singh's theories, physicians in the United States began prescribing amiodarone to their patients with potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in the late 1970s. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was reluctant to officially approve the use of amiodarone since initial reports had shown an increased incidence of serious pulmonary side effects of the drug. In the mid-1980s, the European pharmaceutical companies began putting pressure on the FDA to approve amiodarone by threatening to cut the supply to American physicians if it was not approved. In December 1985, amiodarone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of arrhythmias. === Name === Amiodarone may be an acronym for its IUPAC name (2-butyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-[4-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]-3,5-diiodophenyl]methanone, where ar is a placeholder for phenyl. This is partially supported by dronedarone which is noniodinated benzofuran derivative of amiodarone, where the arylmethanone is conserved. == Dosing == Amiodarone is available in oral and intravenous formulations. Orally, it is available under the brand names Pacerone (produced by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc.) and Cordarone (produced by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories). It is also available under the brand name Aratac (produced by Alphapharm Pty Ltd) in Australia and New Zealand, and further in Australia under the brands Cardinorm and Rithmik as well as a number of generic brands. Also Arycor in South Africa (Produced by Winthrop Pharmaceuticals.). In South America, it is known as Atlansil and is produced by Roemmers. In India, amiodarone is marketed (produced by Cipla Pharmaceutical) under the brand name Tachyra. It is also available in intravenous ampules and vials. The dose of amiodarone administered is tailored to the individual and the dysrhythmia that is being treated. When administered orally, the bioavailability of amiodarone is quite variable. Absorption ranges from 22 to 95%, with better absorption when it is given with food. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
266	Coronaric acid	WIKIPEDIA	Coronaric acid (leukotoxin or leukotoxin A) is a mono-unsaturated, epoxide derivative of the di-unsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (i.e. 9(Z),12(Z) octadecadienoic acid). It is a mixture of the two optically active isomers of 12(Z) 9,10-epoxy-octadecenoic acid. This mixture is also termed 9,10-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic acid or 9(10)-EpOME (for Epoxy-Octadeca-MonoEnoic acid) and when formed by or studied in mammalians, leukotoxin. == Occurrence == Coronaric acid is found in the seed oils derived from plants in the sunflower family, such as Helianthus annuus and Xeranthemum annuum. Coronaric acid is also formed by the cells and tissues of various mammalian (including human) species through the metabolism of linoleic acid by cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase enzymes. These CYPs (CYP2C9 and probably other CYPs that metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids to epoxides) metabolize linoleic acid to 9S,10R-epoxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid and 9R,10S-epoxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid, i.e. the (+) and (-) epoxy optical isomers of coronaric acid. When studied in this context, the optical isomer mixture is often termed leukotoxin. These same CYP epoxygenases concurrently attack linoleic acid at the carbon 12,13 rather than 9,10 double bond of linoleic acid to form a mixture of (+) and (-) epoxy optical isomers viz., 12S,13R-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic and 12R,13S-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acids. This (+) and (-) optical mixture is often termed vernolic acid when studied in plants and isoleukotoxin when studied in mammals. Coronaric acid is found in urine samples from healthy human subjects and increases 3- to 4-fold when these subjects are treated with a salt-loading diet. Coronaric and vernolic acids also form non-enzymatically when linoleic acid is exposed to oxygen and/or UV radiation as a result of the spontaneous process of autoxidation. This autoxidation complicates studies in that it is often difficult to determine if these epoxy fatty acids identified in linoleic acid-rich plant and mammalian tissues represent actual tissue contents or are artifacts formed during their isolation and detection. == Metabolism == In mammalian tissue, coronaric acid is metabolized to its two corresponding dihydroxy stereoisomers, 9S,10R-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic and 9R,10S-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acids, by soluble epoxide hydrolase within minutes of its formation. The metabolism of coronaric acid to these two products, collectively termed leukotoxin diols, appears to be critical to coronaric acid's toxicity, i.e. the diols are the toxic metabolites of the non-toxic or far less toxic coronaric acid. == Activities == === Toxicities === At very high concentrations, the linoleic acid-derived set of optical isomers, coronaric acid (i.e. leukotoxin) possesses toxicity similar to that of other structurally unrelated leukotoxins. It is toxic to leukocytes and other cell types, and when injected into rodents produces multiple organ failure and respiratory distress. These effects appear to be due to its conversion to its dihydroxy counterparts, 9S,10R- and 9R,10S-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acids by soluble epoxide hydrolase. Some studies suggest, but have not yet proven, that isoleukotoxin, acting primarily if not exclusively through its dihydroxy counterparts, is responsible for or contributes to multiple organ failure, the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and certain other cataclysmic diseases in humans (see Epoxygenase § Linoleic acid). Vernolic acid (i.e. isoleukotoxin) shares a similar metabolic fate in being converted by soluble epoxide hydrolase to its dihydroxide counterparts, resulting in the toxic actions of those counterparts. === Other activities === At lower concentrations, isoleukotoxin and its dihydroxy counterparts can protect from the toxic actions cited above that occur at higher concentrations of isoleukotoxin and leukotoxin; they may also share with the epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatreienoates (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids), anti-hypertension activities. == References ==	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD	{'END': -0.011015521, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -6.704273e-07, ' FOOD': -2.8206474e-05}
277	Leukotoxin diol	PUBMED	 Leukotoxin is clinically associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, we found that leukotoxin-diol, the hydrated product of leukotoxin, is more toxic than the parent leukotoxin in vitro (Moghaddam and colleagues, Nature Med. 1997;3:562-566). To test if this difference in the toxicity of leukotoxin and leukotoxin-diol exists in vivo, Swiss Webster mice were administered leukotoxin or leukotoxin-diol. All mice treated with leukotoxin-diol died of ARDS-like respiratory distress, whereas the animals exposed to leukotoxin at the same dose survived. Histopathologic evaluation of the lungs revealed massive alveolar edema and hemorrhage with interstitial edema around blood vessels in the lungs of mice treated with leukotoxin-diol, whereas the lungs of mice treated with identical doses of leukotoxin had perivascular edema only and little change in alveolar spaces. Immunohistochemistry showed that the soluble epoxide hydrolase responsible for the hydrolysis of leukotoxin to its diol is concentrated in the vascular smooth muscle of small and medium-sized pulmonary vessels. In addition, 4-phenylchalcone oxide, an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase, was found to decrease the mortality induced by leukotoxin but had no effect on mortality induced by leukotoxin-diol. These studies provide strong in vivo evidence that leukotoxin may act as a protoxicant and that the corresponding diol is a putative toxic mediator involved in the development of ARDS. LC/MS quantification of leukotoxin (LTX) and leukotoxin diol (LTXdiol) in plasma has been previously reported, however large sample volumes are required for achieving stated assay Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ). Reported here is a fit-for-purpose LC/MS method that reduces plasma volume from 700 to 25 µL and omits pre-concentration steps. These improvements make for a method with increased utility in mouse studies offering limited sample volumes. Additionally, omitting pre-concentration steps streamlines sample processing, which can now be completed in under 10 min. This method can be used to quickly answer if the ratio of LTX to LTXdiol changes with the dose of the therapeutic drug so this could be used as a potential biomarker for correlating PK/PD effects. No extensive assay characterization was performed before application to an exploratory in-life study. Basal levels of LTX and LTXdiol in plasma were quantified by LC-MRM across 10 individual mice, and the average signal-to-noise was 36 for LTX and 3039 for LTXdiol, with CVs of 29.4% and 15.2%, respectively. Addition of LTX and LTXdiol reference standard at 5, 25, and 75 ng/mL into pooled mouse plasma was quantifiable within 30% relative error using a surrogate matrix calibration curve ranging from 0.8 to 200 ng/mL. The average ratio of LTX to LTXdiol across the 10 mice was 0.32, consistent with previous reports. Finally, the method was applied to a mouse PK/PD study to monitor LTX/LTXdiol kinetics after a single oral dose of a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor. The mean plasma ratio of LTX to LTXdiol increased up to 10-fold by 3 h post-dose followed by a decrease to near pre-dose levels by 24 h, consistent with transient inhibition of sEH-mediated conversion of LTX to LTXdiol. The method improvements described here will make subsequent quantification of LTX and LTXdiol in mouse studies significantly easier. Leukotoxin, a cytochrome P450-derived epoxide of linoleic acid, has been implicated as a causative factor in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Conversion of this fatty acid epoxide to leukotoxin diol by epoxide hydrolase has been hypothesized as the critical activation step in leukotoxin-induced cellular toxicity. In both human and insect cells, we observed that leukotoxin diol causes acute cellular toxicity and that cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition, ameliorates leukotoxin diol-associated toxicity. To evaluate mitochondria as a target of leukotoxin diol, multiple aspects of mitochondrial integrity were evaluated in both cell- and organelle-based assays. Leukotoxin diol specifically activated the mitochondrial permeability transition, resulting in release of cytochrome c and subsequent cell death. Pretreatment with cyclosporin A inhibited these effects and, furthermore, limited in vivo toxicity. While the mechanisms underlying leukotoxin-mediated toxicity remain to be fully elucidated, the observation that leukotoxin diol disrupts mitochondrial function specifically through activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition suggests at least one mechanism through which leukotoxin diol may exert its activity in physiological contexts.

280	Cis-11,14-eicosadienoic acid	PUBMED	 An untargeted multi-omics study implicated the potential dysregulation of fatty acid, nucleotide, and energy metabolism in the brainstems of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). A further quantitative exploration of the alterations in the metabolic pathways is necessary for a deep understanding of the central nervous system in SHRs. Targeted metabolic profiling of 40 fatty acids (PeptideAtlas: PASS01671) and 32 metabolites of nucleotides and energy metabolism (PeptideAtlas: PASS01672) and parallel reaction monitoring analysis of 5 proteins (PeptideAtlas: PASS01673) were performed on the brainstems of SHRs ( The fatty acid (FA) composition of fresh mycelia of anaerobic rumen fungi was determined. The fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) of six strains belonging to four genera (Neocallimastix, Caecomyces, Orpinomyces, Anaeromyces) and one unknown strain were analyzed by gas chromatography. All studied fungi possess the same FAs but differences were found in their relative concentrations. The FA profile of anaerobic fungi comprises carbon chains of length ranging from 12 to 24; the most common fatty acids were stearic (C(18:0)), arachidic (C(20:0)), heneicosanoic (C(21:0)), behenic (C(22:0)), tricosanoic (C(23:0)) and lignoceric (C(24:0)) with relative amount representing >4% of total FA. Significant differences were determined for heptadecanoic, oleic, behenic and tricosanoic acids. Rumen anaerobic fungi can contain very long chain fatty acids; we found unsaturated fatty acids including cis-11-eicosenoic (C(20:1)), cis-11,14-eicosadienoic (C(20:2)), erucic (C(22:1n9)), cis-13,16-docosadienoic (C(22:2)) and nervonic (C(24:1)) acids in very small amounts but their presence seems to be unique for anaerobic fungi. Unsaturated fatty acid esters of 4'-demethyldeoxypodophyllotoxin (DDPT) were prepared and tested for antitumor activity. The esters showed increased in vivo antitumor activity despite the lower in vitro activity than DDPT. Especially, the ester (DFE12) of all-cis-11,14-eicosadienoic acid was much better (IR, 83%) than VP-16 (IR, 60%) without loss of body weight. Unsaturated fatty acids could be evaluated to be good carrier vehicles of DDPT.	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -0.23694673, 'OD': 0.0}
282	Glyceryl monolinoleate	PUBMED	 A group of fatty acid esters capable of forming liquid crystals has been identified as a new class of potential bioadhesive substances. The liquid crystals may act as a controlled release system. The experimental work was focused on the monoglycerides, glyceryl mono-oleate (GMO) and glyceryl monolinoleate (GML). The mucoadhesive properties of GMO and GML were demonstrated in vitro by a 'flushing' bioadhesion test system and a tensiometric method. The flushing system was validated with GMO. Mucoadhesion is influenced by the drug and excipient added, their concentrations, and the ability to form especially the cubic phase. It has been shown that the cubic phase is mucoadhesive when formed on wet mucosa, such as rabbit jejunum, and that drug added to the precursor formulation is incorporated in the cubic phase formed. Tensiometric measurements have shown that the unswollen monoglycerides have the greatest mucoadhesion, followed by the partly swollen lamellar phase and the fully swollen cubic phase. The values found for the work of adhesion were in the range 0.007-0.048 mJcm-2. The mechanism of mucoadhesion is unspecific and probably involves dehydration of the mucosa. The cubic phase of GMO and GML may be an interesting candidate for a bioadhesive drug delivery system.

284	Ethyl linoleate	PUBMED	 Ethyl linoleate is an unsaturated fatty acid used in many cosmetics for its various attributes, such as antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties and clinically proven to be an effective anti-acne agent. In this study, we investigated the effect of ethyl linoleate on the melanogenesis and the mechanism underlying its action on melanogenesis in B16F10 murine melanoma cells. Our results revealed that ethyl linoleate significantly inhibited melanin content and intracellular tyrosinase activity in α-MSH-induced B16F10 cells, but it did not directly inhibit activity of mushroom tyrosinase. Ethyl linoleate inhibited the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase, and tyrosinase related protein 1 (TRP1) in governing melanin pigment synthesis. We observed that ethyl linoleate inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and reduced the level of β-catenin, suggesting that ethyl linoleate inhibits melanogenesis through Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin signal pathway. Therefore, we propose that ethyl linoleate may be useful as a safe whitening agent in cosmetic and a potential therapeutic agent for reducing skin hyperpigmentation in clinics. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system plays an active role in epidermal homeostasis. Phytocannabinoids such as cannabidiol modulate this system but also act through eCB-independent mechanisms. This study evaluated the effects of cannabidiol, bakuchiol (BAK), and ethyl (linoleate/oleate) (ELN) in keratinocytes and reconstituted human epidermis. Molecular docking simulations showed that each compound binds the active site of the eCB carrier FABP5. However, BAK and ethyl linoleate bound this site with the highest affinity when combined 1:1 (w/w), and in vitro assays showed that BAK + ELN most effectively inhibited FABP5 and fatty acid amide hydrolase. In TNF-stimulated keratinocytes, BAK + ELN reversed TNF-induced expression shifts and uniquely downregulated type I IFN genes and  The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests of cruciferous vegetables. However, DBM has developed resistance to current chemical and biological insecticides used for its control, indicating the necessity for finding new insecticides against it. Bio-insecticides derived from plant extracts are eco-friendly alternatives to synthetic pesticides. The aims of this study were to evaluate the insecticidal activity of Consolida ajacis seed extracts against DBM, the underlying mechanism of the control effect of promising extracts, and the identification of the main insecticidal compounds of these extracts.

285	Linoleic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Linoleic acid (LA) is an organic compound with the formula HOOC(CH2)7CH=CHCH2CH=CH(CH2)4CH3. Both alkene groups (−CH=CH−) are cis. It is a fatty acid sometimes denoted 18:2 (n−6) or 18:2 cis-9,12. A linoleate is a salt or ester of this acid. Linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated, omega−6 fatty acid. It is a colorless liquid that is virtually insoluble in water but soluble in many organic solvents. It typically occurs in nature as a triglyceride (ester of glycerin) rather than as a free fatty acid. It is one of two essential fatty acids for humans, who must obtain it through their diet, and the most essential, because the body uses it as a base to make the others. The word ""linoleic"" derives from Latin linum 'flax' and oleum 'oil', reflecting the fact that it was first isolated from linseed oil. == History == In 1844, F. Sacc, working at the laboratory of Justus von Liebig, isolated linoleic acid from linseed oil. In 1886, K. Peters determined the existence of two double bonds. Its essential role in human diet was discovered by G. O. Burr and others in 1930. Its chemical structure was determined by T. P. Hilditch and others in 1939, and it was synthesized by R. A. Raphael and F. Sondheimer in 1950. == In physiology == The consumption of linoleic acid is vital to proper health, as it is an essential fatty acid. === Metabolism and eicosanoids === Linoleic acid (LA: C18H32O2; 18:2,n−6) is a precursor to arachidonic acid (AA: C20H32O2; 20:4,n−6) with elongation and unsaturation. AA is the precursor to some prostaglandins, leukotrienes (LTA, LTB, LTC), thromboxane (TXA) and the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA: C22H37NO2; 20:4,n−6), and other endocannabinoids and eicosanoids. The metabolism of LA to AA begins with the conversion of LA into gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), effected by Δ6 desaturase. GLA is converted to dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), the immediate precursor to AA. LA is also converted by various lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases, cytochrome P450 enzymes (the CYP monooxygenases), and non-enzymatic autoxidation mechanisms to mono-hydroxyl products viz., 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, and 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid; these two hydroxy metabolites are enzymatically oxidized to their keto metabolites, 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid and 9-oxo-octadecdienoic acid. Certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, the CYP epoxygenases, catalyze oxidation of LA to epoxide products viz., its 12,13-epoxide, vernolic acid, and its 9,10-epoxide, coronaric acid. These linoleic acid products are implicated in human physiology and pathology. Hydroperoxides derived from the metabolism of anandamide (AEA: C22H37NO2; 20:4,n−6), or its linoleoyl analogues, are by a lipoxygenase action found to be competitive inhibitors of brain and immune cell FAAH, the enzyme that breaks down AEA and other endocannabinoids, and the compound linoleoyl-ethanol-amide (C20H37NO2; 18:2,n−6), an N-acylethanolamine, - the ethanolamide of linoleic acid (LA: C18H32O2; 18:2,n−6) and its metabolized incorporated ethanolamine (MEA: C2H7NO), is the first natural inhibitor of FAAH, discovered. == Uses and reactions == Linoleic acid is a component of quick-drying oils, which are useful in oil paints and varnishes. These applications exploit the lability of the doubly allylic C−H groups (−CH=CH−CH2−CH=CH−) toward oxygen in air (autoxidation). Addition of oxygen leads to crosslinking and formation of a stable film. Reduction of the carboxylic acid group of linoleic acid yields linoleyl alcohol. Linoleic acid is a surfactant with a critical micelle concentration of 1.5 x 10−4 M @ pH 7.5. Linoleic acid has become increasingly popular in the beauty products industry because of its beneficial properties on the skin. Research points to linoleic acid's anti-inflammatory, acne reductive, skin-lightening and moisture retentive properties when applied topically on the skin. Linoleic acid is also used in some bar of soap products. == Dietary sources == It is abundant in safflower, and corn oil, and comprises over half their composition by weight. It is present in medium quantities in soybean oils, sesame, and almonds. === Other occurrences === Cockroaches release oleic and linoleic acid upon death, which discourages other roaches from entering the area. This is similar to the mechanism found in ants and bees, which release oleic acid upon death. == Health effects == Consumption of linoleic acid has been associated with lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and premature death. There is high-quality evidence that increased intake of linoleic acid decreases total blood cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Higher in vivo circulating and tissue levels of linoleic acid are associated with a lower risk of major cardiovascular events. Clinical trials have shown that increased linoleic acid intake does not increase markers of inflammation or oxidative stress. The American Heart Association advises people to replace saturated fat with linoleic acid to reduce CVD risk. == See also == Conjugated linoleic acid Essential fatty acid interactions Essential nutrients Linolein == References == == Further reading == ""Compound Summary: Linoleic acid"".

288	Linoleoyl ethanolamide	PUBMED	 Linoleoyl ethanolamide has been showed to serve as a new and additional class of endogenous signaling molecule and exhibited a variety of biological activities in cells and tissues. Herein, we reported an effective method for the synthesis of linoleoyl ethanolamide. Enzymatic and chemical syntheses of linoleoyl ethanolamide were first compared and then reaction conditions were optimized. When the reaction was conducted at 30°C for 1 h by reacting 0.5 mmol methyl linoleate with 5 mmol ethanolamine in the presence of 15 μL, 5.4 mol/L sodium methoxide in methanol as catalyst, 97.2% linoleoyl ethanolamide was produced in the crude reaction mixture without further purification after the removal of excess ethanolamine. Additionally, the reaction can be conducted on a large scale, which resulted in the formation of 95.9% linoleoyl ethanolamide. Compared to previous studies, the amidation reaction between methyl linoleate and ethanolamine with sodium methoxide as catalyst for the synthesis of linoleoyl ethanolamide is more effective and faster. In addition, the reaction is scalable and reaction conditions are mild. This is the first time to use methyl linoleate to synthesize linoleoyl ethanolamide. Commercial linoleoyl ethanolamide is very expensive. However, the scalability and ease for such synthesis make it possible to study the biological and nutritional functions of the cannabinoid-like linoleoyl ethanolamide in animal or human subjects. In our previous study, it was found that linoleoyl ethanolamide (LE) is present in sake lees, which are produced as a byproduct during the making of Japanese sake. LE is a fatty acid ethanolamide, which have been demonstrated to exert a variety of biological functions, and in this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of LE were examined using in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal experiments. In mouse RAW264.7 macrophages, LE suppressed the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. In addition, LE inhibited LPS-induced increases in the levels of cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 and prostaglandin E(2), which are indicators of inflammation. The inhibitory effect of LE on the release of TNF-α was stronger than that of dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, which is widely used in external human skin care treatments. LE also suppressed the LPS-induced activation of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65. In a contact dermatitis animal model, applying LE to affected ear skin ameliorated 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene-induced contact dermatitis and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression at inflamed sites. These results indicate that LE exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB signaling, and LE is proposed to be a useful therapeutic agent against contact dermatitis.

290	Anandamide	WIKIPEDIA	"Anandamide (ANA), also referred to as N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) is a fatty acid neurotransmitter belonging to the fatty acid derivative group known as N-acylethanolamine (NAE). Anandamide takes its name from the Sanskrit word ananda, meaning ""joy, bliss, delight,"" plus amide. Anandamide, the first discovered endocannabinoid, engages with the body's endocannabinoid system by binding to the same cannabinoid receptors that THC found in cannabis acts on. Anandamide can be found within tissues in a wide range of animals. It has also been found in plants, such as the cacao tree. Anandamide is derived from the non-oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid, an essential omega-6 fatty acid. It is synthesized from N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine by multiple pathways. It is degraded primarily by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme, which converts anandamide into ethanolamine and arachidonic acid. As such, inhibitors of FAAH lead to elevated anandamide levels and are being pursued for possible therapeutic use. == Discovery == Anandamide was discovered by Raphael Mechoulam and fellow coworkers in 1992. This was the first marijuana-like substance produced by the human body to be observed. By examining a pig brain and canine gut, they were able to isolate ANA using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. ANA works within the system of the brain associated with the feeling of reward, and as such, has been the topic of many research studies. Since the 1992 findings, many studies have been completed to examine ANA further, including research on behavioral and molecular effects. == Research == According to in vitro research, anandamide effects are mediated primarily by CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system, and CB2 cannabinoid receptors in the periphery. The latter appear to be involved in functions of the immune system. Cannabinoid receptors were originally discovered as sensitive to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC, commonly called THC), which is the primary psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis. The discovery of anandamide came from research into CB1 and CB2, as it was inevitable that a naturally occurring (endogenous) chemical would be found to affect these receptors. Anandamide is under research for its potential involvement in the implantation of the early stage embryo in its blastocyst form into the uterus. Therefore, cannabinoids such as Δ9-THC might influence processes during the earliest stages of human pregnancy. Peak plasma anandamide occurs at ovulation and positively correlates with peak estradiol and gonadotrophin levels, suggesting that these may be involved in the regulation of anandamide levels. Subsequently, anandamide has been proposed as a biomarker of infertility, but so far lacks any predictive values in order to be used clinically. === Behavior === Both the CB1 and CB2 receptors (the binding site of anandamide) are under research for a possible role in positive and negative interpretation of environment and setting. The binding relationship of anandamide and the CB1/CB2 may affect neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and glutamate. Endocannabinoids may disturb homeostasis in several ways: by enhancing hunger sensations, encouraging increased food intake, and shifting energy balance towards energy storage. A resultant decrease in energy expenditure is observed. Cortical glutamatergic transmission may be modulated by endocannabinoids during stress and fear habituation. === Obesity and liver disease === Blockade of CB1 receptors was found to improve lipid resistance and lipid profile in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Elevated anandamide levels are found in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis. === Topical effects === The American Academy of Dermatology has named topical anandamide a promising therapy for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. == Biosynthesis == In humans, anandamide is biosynthesized from N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). In turn, NAPE arises by transfer of arachidonic acid from lecithin to the free amine of cephalin through an N-acyltransferase enzyme. Anandamide synthesis from NAPE occurs via multiple pathways and includes enzymes such as phospholipase A2, phospholipase C and N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolysing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), with other key enzymes yet to be identified. The crystal structure of NAPE-PLD in complex with phosphatidylethanolamine and deoxycholate shows how the cannabinoid anandamide is generated from membrane N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), and reveals that bile acids – which are mainly involved in the absorption of lipids in the small intestine – modulate its biogenesis. == Metabolism == Endogenous anandamide is present at very low levels and has a very short half-life due to the action of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which breaks it down into free arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. Studies of piglets show that dietary levels of arachidonic acid and other essential fatty acids affect the levels of anandamide and other endocannabinoids in the brain. High fat diet feeding in mice increases levels of anandamide in the liver and increases lipogenesis. Anandamide may be relevant to the development of obesity, at least in rodents. Paracetamol (known as acetaminophen in the US and Canada) is metabolically combined with arachidonic acid by FAAH to form AM404. This metabolite is a potent agonist at the TRPV1 vanilloid receptor, a weak agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors, and an inhibitor of anandamide reuptake. Consequently, anandamide levels in the body and brain are elevated. Thus, paracetamol acts as a pro-drug for a cannabimimetic metabolite, which may be partially or fully responsible for its analgesic effects. Black pepper contains the alkaloid guineesine, which is an anandamide reuptake inhibitor. It may therefore increase anandamide's physiological effects. == Transport == Endocannabinoid transporters for anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol include the heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs). Anandamide shows a preference for binding to cholesterol and ceramide over other membrane lipids. Cholesterol acts as a binding partner for anandamide. Initially, a hydrogen bond facilitates their interaction. Following this, anandamide is drawn towards the membrane interior, where it forms a molecular complex with cholesterol. This process involves a conformational adaptation of anandamide to the apolar membrane environment. Subsequently, the anandamide-cholesterol complex is directed to the cannabinoid receptor (CB1) and then exits. == See also == Virodhamine == References == == External links =="	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD	{'END': -7.89631e-07, 'O': -1.9361265e-07, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -0.003290829, ' FOOD': -0.01492822}
297	Valsartan	WIKIPEDIA	Valsartan, sold under the brand name Diovan among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It belongs to a class of medications referred to as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include feeling tired, dizziness, high blood potassium, diarrhea, and joint pain. Other serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Valsartan was patented in 1990, and came into medical use in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 117th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Valsartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and to reduce death for people with left ventricular dysfunction after having a heart attack. === High blood pressure === Valsartan (and other ARBs) are an appropriate initial treatment option for most people with high blood pressure and no other coexisting conditions, as are ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers. If patients have coexisting diabetes or kidney disease, ARBs or ACE inhibitors may be considered over other classes of blood pressure medicines. === Heart failure === Valsartan has reduced rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalisations when used alone or in combination with beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure. Importantly, the combination of valsartan and ACE inhibitors has not shown morbidity or mortality benefits but rather increases mortality risk when added to combination beta blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy, and increases the risk of adverse events like hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal failure. As shown in the PARADIGM-HF study, valsartan combined with sacubitril for the treatment of heart failure, significantly reduced all cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisations due to heart failure. === Diabetic kidney disease === In people with type 2 diabetes, antihypertensive therapy with valsartan decreases the rate of progression of albuminuria (albumin in urine), promotes regression to normoalbuminuria and may reduce the rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease. == Contraindications == The packaging for valsartan includes a warning stating the drug should not be used with the renin inhibitor aliskiren in people with diabetes. It also states the safety of the drug in severe renal impairment has not been established. Valsartan includes a black box warning for fetal toxicity. Discontinuation of these agents is recommended immediately after detection of pregnancy and an alternative medication should be started. Breastfeeding is not recommended. == Side effects == Side effects depend on the reason the medication is being used. === Heart failure === Adverse effects are based on a comparison versus placebo in people with heart failure. Most common side effects include dizziness (17% vs 9% ), low blood pressure (7% vs 2%), and diarrhea (5% vs 4%). Less common side effects include joint pain, fatigue, and back pain (all 3% vs 2%). === Hypertension === Clinical trials for valsartan treatment for hypertension versus placebo demonstrate side effects like viral infection (3% vs 2%), fatigue (2% vs 1%) and abdominal pain (2% vs 1%). Minor side effects that occurred at >1% but were similar to rates from the placebo group include: headache dizziness upper respiratory infection cough diarrhea rhinitis/sinusitis nausea pharyngitis edema arthralgia === Kidney failure === People treated with ARBs including valsartan or diuretics are susceptible to conditions of developing low renal blood flow such as abnormal narrowing of blood vessels in the kidney, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion whose renal function is in part dependent on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system like efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction done by angiotensin II are at high risk of deterioration of renal function comprising acute kidney failure, oliguria, worsening azotemia or heightened serum creatinine. When blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidney activates a series of responses that triggers angiotensin release to constrict blood vessels and facilitate blood flow in the kidney. So long as the nephron function degradation is progressive or reaches clinically significant levels, withholding or discontinuing valsartan is warranted. == Interactions == The US prescribing information lists the following drug interactions for valsartan: Other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may increase the risks of low blood pressure, kidney problems, and hyperkalemia. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. NSAIDs may increase the risk of kidney problems and may interfere with blood pressure-lowering effects. Valsartan may increase the concentration of lithium. Valsartan and other angiotensin-related blood pressure medications may interact with the antibiotics co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin to increase risk of sudden death due to cardiac arrest. === Food interaction === With the tablet, food decreases the valsartan tablet taker's exposure to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, evidenced by AUC change. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Valsartan blocks the actions of angiotensin II, which include constricting blood vessels and activating aldosterone, to reduce blood pressure. The drug binds to angiotensin type I receptors (AT1), working as an antagonist. This mechanism of action is different than that of the ACE inhibitor drugs, which block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As valsartan acts at the receptor, it can provide more complete angiotensin II antagonism since angiotensin II is generated by other enzymes as well as ACE. Also, valsartan does not affect the metabolism of bradykinin like ACE inhibitors do. === Pharmacodynamics === === Pharmacokinetics === The peak concentration of valsartan in plasma occurs 2 to 4 hours after dosing. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan are observed to be approximately linearly dose-dependent over therapeutic dosing range. Owing to its relatively short elimination half life attribution, valsartan concentration in plasma does not accumulate in response to repeated dosing. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2010, valsartan (trade name Diovan) achieved annual sales of $2.052 billion in the United States and $6.053 billion worldwide. The patents for valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide expired in September 2012. === Combinations === Versions are available as the combinations valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/nebivolol, and valsartan/sacubitril. Valsartan is combined with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (or both) into single-pill formulations for treating hypertension with multiple drugs. Valsartan is also available as the combination valsartan/sacubitril. It is used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. === Recalls === In July 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recalled certain batches of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide film-coated tablets distributed in 22 countries in the European Union. Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. (ZHP) in Linhai, China manufactured the bulk ingredient contaminated by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a carcinogen. The active pharmaceutical ingredient was subsequently imported by a number of generic drugmakers, including Novartis, and marketed in Europe and Asia under their subsidiary Sandoz labeling, and in the UK by Dexcel Pharma Ltd and Accord Healthcare. Valsartan was recalled in Canada. Authorities believe the degree of contamination is negligible. In July 2018, The National Agency of Drug and Food Control (NA-DFC or Badan POM Indonesia) announced voluntary recalls for two products containing valsartan produced by Actavis Indonesia and Dipa Pharmalab Intersains. In July 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced voluntary recalls of certain supplies of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in the US distributed by Solco Healthcare LLC, Major Pharmaceuticals, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Hong Kong's Department of Health initiated a similar recall. In August 2018, the FDA published two lengthy, updated lists, classifying hundreds of specific US products containing valsartan into those included versus excluded from the recall. A week later, the FDA cited two more drugmakers, Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceuticals of China and Hetero Labs Limited of India, as additional sources of the contaminated valsartan ingredient. In September 2018, the FDA announced that retesting of all valsartan supplies had found a second carcinogenic impurity, N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), in the recalled products made by ZHP in China and marketed in the US under the Torrent Pharmaceuticals (India) brand. According to a 2018 Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies' records, more than 50 companies around the world have recalled valsartan mono-preparations or combination products manufactured from the tainted valsartan ingredient. The contamination has likely been present since 2012 when the manufacturing process was changed and approved by EDQM and FDA authorities. Based on inspections in late 2018, both agencies have suspended the Chinese and Indian manufacturers' certificates of suitability for the supply of valsartan in the EU and the US. In 2019, many more preparations of valsartan and its combinations were recalled due to the presence of the contaminant NDMA. In August 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided guidance to marketing authorization holders on how to avoid the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicines and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk. The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. === Shortages === Since July 2018, numerous recalls of losartan, valsartan and irbesartan drug products have caused marked shortages of these life saving medications in North America and Europe, particularly for valsartan. In March 2019, the FDA approved an additional generic version of valsartan to address the issue. According to the agency, the shortage of valsartan was resolved in April 2020, but the availability of the generic form remained unstable into July 2020. Pharmacies in the European Union were notified that the supply of the drug, particularly for higher dosage forms, would remain unstable well into December 2020. == Research == In people with impaired glucose tolerance, valsartan may decrease the incidence of developing diabetes mellitus type 2. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (less than 1 percent per year) and diet, exercise or other drugs, may be more protective. In the same study, no reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events (including death) was shown. In one study of people without diabetes, valsartan reduced the risk of developing diabetes mellitus over amlodipine, mainly for those with hypertension. A prospective study demonstrated a reduction in the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
308	Olmesartan medoxomil	WIKIPEDIA	Olmesartan, sold under the brand name Benicar among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). Versions are available as the combination olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and olmesartan/amlodipine. It is available as a prodrug, olmesartan medoxomil. Common side effects include dizziness, headaches, diarrhea, and back pain. Serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the fetus and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. It was patented in 1991 and came into medical use in 2002. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 97th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == In the United States, olmesartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in people aged six years of age and older to lower blood pressure. Olmesartan is used for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. == Contraindications == Contraindications for treatment with olmesartan include biliary obstruction. Another major contraindication is pregnancy; reports in the scientific literature reveal fetal malformations for pregnant women taking sartan-derived drugs. == Adverse effects == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that the benefits of olmesartan continue to outweigh its potential risks when used for the treatment of people with high blood pressure according to the drug label. The incidence of adverse effects with olmesartan is reported as similar to placebo; the only adverse effect that occurred in >1% of patients treated with it and more frequently than placebo was dizziness (3% vs 1%). Rarely, olmesartan can cause severe gastrointestinal issues. The symptoms, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and electrolyte abnormalities, are common among those who have celiac disease. Recent studies suggested this form of sprue-like enteropathy could be caused by the inhibition of TGF-β, a polypeptide cytokine that maintains intestinal homeostasis. However, it is still unclear why this action was never observed with other ARBs. In studies of angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as olmesartan, patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected. == Chemistry == Olmesartan medoxomil, an ester prodrug, is completely and rapidly hydrolyzed to its active acid form, olmesartan. == History == It was patented in 1991 and came into medical use in 2002. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Olmesartan and Sevikar HCT combined is marketed worldwide by Daiichi Sankyo, in India by Abbott Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. under the trade name WinBP, by Zydus Cadila under the trade name Olmy, by Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. under the trade name Olvance, Olsar by Unichem Laboratories and in Canada by Schering-Plough as Olmetec. The marketing rights to the brand names Benicar, Benicar HCT, Azor, and Tribenzor in the United States were transferred from Daiichi Sankyo to Cosette in January 2022. Several preparations containing olmesartan and other antihypertensives are available. Teva Pharmaceuticals produces a formulation containing olmesartan, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide. Benicar HCT is the brand name of a medication containing olmesartan medoxomil with hydrochlorothiazide. Benitec H, another medication containing olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide, is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline in India. == Research == Olmesartan has demonstrated potential benefits in reducing the progression of atherosclerotic buildup in arteries. In large randomized placebo-controlled or active drug-controlled studies conducted in participants with hypertension, stable angina, or type 2 diabetes, long-term treatment with olmesartan has been shown to reduce the levels of markers of vascular inflammation. This effect was also observed in a high-cholesterol primate test model. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
311	Clindamycin n-oxide	PUBMED	 CM 6606 differs in its mode of action from chloroquine but studies on its activity against parasites resistant to other antimalarials suggest that it may have some features in common with aminoalcohols. Similarities in drug-induced pigment changes are especially striking. Only halofantrine shows a reduced activity, however, against parasites that are highly resistant to CM 6606, while such parasites are slightly hypersensitive to sulfadoxine and clindamycin. Evidence suggesting that CM 6606 may function through an active metabolite, possibly CM 6609 in which the N-oxide is reduced, is discussed.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.0137669975}
313	Clindamycin sulfoxide	PUBMED	 In a research project on risk management of harmful substances in water cycles, clindamycin and 12 further antibiotics were determined in different sewage samples. In contrast to other antibiotics, an increase of the clindamycin concentration in the final effluent in comparison to the influent of the sewage treatment plant (STP) was observed. A back transformation from the main metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide to clindamycin during the denitrification process has been discussed. Therefore, the concentration of this metabolite was measured additionally. Clindamycin sulfoxide was stable in the STP and the assumption of back transformation of the metabolite to clindamycin was confuted. To explain the increasing clindamycin concentration in the STP, the ratio of clindamycin sulfoxide to clindamycin was observed. The ratio increased in dry spells with concentrated samples and with long dwell time in the sewer system. A short hydraulic retention in waste water system and diluted samples in periods of extreme rainfall lead to a lower ratio of clindamycin sulfoxide to clindamycin concentration. A plausible explanation of this behavior could be that clindamycin was adsorbed strongly to a component of the sewage during this long residence time and in the STP, clindamycin was released. In the common sample preparation in the lab, clindamycin was not released. Measurements of clindamycin and clindamycin sulfoxide in the influent and effluent of STP is advised for sewage monitoring.

322	Hydroquinidine	WIKIPEDIA	Dihydroquinidine (also called hydroquinidine) is an organic compound, a cinchona alkaloid closely related to quinine. The specific rotation is +226° in ethanol at 2 g/100 ml. A derivative of this molecule is used as chiral ligand in the AD-mix for Sharpless dihydroxylation. The substance is also a class Ia antiarrhythmic medication. == See also == Dihydroquinine == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
324	Stercobilin	WIKIPEDIA	Stercobilin is a tetrapyrrolic bile pigment and is one end-product of heme catabolism. It is the chemical responsible for the brown color of human feces and was originally isolated from feces in 1932. Stercobilin (and related urobilin) can be used as a marker for biochemical identification of fecal pollution levels in rivers. == Metabolism == Stercobilin results from breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin found in erythrocytes (red blood cells). Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin, which rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Bilirubin binds tightly to plasma proteins (especially albumin) in the blood stream and is transported to the liver, where it is conjugated with one or two glucuronic acid residues into bilirubin diglucuronide, and secreted into the small intestine as bile. In the small intestine, some bilirubin glucuronide is converted back to bilirubin via bacterial enzymes in the terminal ileum. This bilirubin is further converted to colorless urobilinogen by the bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase. Urobilinogen that remains in the colon can either be reduced to stercobilinogen and finally oxidized to stercobilin, or it can be directly reduced to stercobilin. Stercobilin is responsible for the brown color of human feces. Stercobilin is then excreted in the feces. == Role in disease == === Obstructive jaundice === In obstructive jaundice, no bilirubin reaches the small intestine, meaning that there is no formation of stercobilinogen. The lack of stercobilin and other bile pigments causes feces to become clay-colored. === Brown pigment gallstones === An analysis of two infants suffering from cholelithiasis observed that a substantial amount of stercobilin was present in brown pigment gallstones. This study suggested that brown pigment gallstones could form spontaneously in infants suffering from bacterial infections of the biliary tract. == Role in treatment of disease == A 1996 study by McPhee et al. suggested that stercobilin and other related pyrrolic pigments — including urobilin, biliverdin, and xanthobilirubic acid — has potential to function as a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors when delivered at low micromolar concentrations. These pigments were selected due to a similarity in shape to the successful HIV-1 protease inhibitor Merck L-700,417 (N,N-bis(2-hydroxy-1-indanyl)-2,6-diphenylmethyl-4-hydroxy-1,7-heptandiamide). Further research is suggested to study the pharmacological efficacy of these pigments. == See also == Bile pigment Bilirubin Biliverdin Heme Urobilin == References ==	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': -1.2664457e-06, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
326	Pioglitazone	WIKIPEDIA	"Pioglitazone, sold under the brand name Actos among others, is an anti-diabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It may be used with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or insulin. Use is recommended together with exercise and diet. It is not recommended in type 1 diabetes. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headaches, muscle pains, inflammation of the throat, and swelling. Serious side effects may include bladder cancer, low blood sugar, heart failure, and osteoporosis. Use is not recommended in pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is in the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class and works by improving sensitivity of tissues to insulin. Pioglitazone was patented in 1985, and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 120th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. It was withdrawn in France and Germany in 2011. == Medical uses == Pioglitazone is used to lower blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes either alone or in combination with sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin. The effects of pioglitazone have been compared in a Cochrane systematic review to that of other blood sugar lowering-medicine, including metformin, acarbose, and repaglinide, as well as with appropriate diet and exercise, not showing any benefit in reducing the chance of developing type 2 diabetes in people at risk. It did, however, show reduction of risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to a placebo or to no treatment. These results should be interpreted considering that most of the data of the studies included in this review were of low or very-low certainty. While pioglitazone does decrease blood sugar levels, the main study that looked at the medication found no difference in the main cardiovascular outcomes that were looked at. The secondary outcome of death from all causes, myocardial infarction, and stroke were lower. Pioglitazone has been found to reduce all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetic patients compared to other therapies, with a 60% reduction in mortality in those exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed. Another study found an all-cause mortality hazard ratio of 0.33 for pioglitazone after adjusting for >40 covariates, compared to insulin. Due to insufficient data on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke, this was not possible to compare in a more recent review. == Contraindications == Pioglitazone cannot be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity to pioglitazone, other thiazolidinediones or any of components of its pharmaceutical forms. It is ineffective and possibly harmful in diabetes mellitus type 1 and diabetic ketoacidosis. Its safety in pregnancy, lactation (breastfeeding) and people under 18 is not established. Given previous experiences with the related drug troglitazone, acute diseases of the liver are regarded as a contraindication for pioglitazone. == Side effects == A press release by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2007 noted that there is a greater incidence of fractures of the upper arms, hands and feet in female diabetics given rosiglitazone compared with those given metformin or glyburide. The information was based on data from the ADOPT trial. Following release of this statement, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, the developer of pioglitazone (sold as Actos in many markets) admitted that it has similar implications for female patients. The risk of hypoglycemia is low in the absence of other drugs that lower blood glucose. Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. As a result, it may precipitate congestive heart failure (which worsens with fluid overload in those at risk). It may cause anemia. Mild weight gain is common due to increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In studies, patients on pioglitazone had an increased proportion of upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, headache, myalgia and tooth problems. Chronic administration of the drug has led to occasional instances of cholestatic hepatitis, reversible upon drug discontinuation. On 30 July 2007, an Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration concluded that the use of rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was associated with a greater risk of ""myocardial ischemic events"" when compared to placebo, but when compared to other diabetes drugs, there was no increased risk. Pioglitazone is currently being reviewed. A meta-analysis released subsequently showed that pioglitazone reduced the risk of ischemic cardiac events rather than increased the risk, but increased CHF. A 2020 Cochrane systematic review assessed occurrence of adverse effects with use of pioglitazone, but was not able to reach any conclusions due to insufficient data on included studies. === Bladder cancer === On 9 June 2011, the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products decided to withdraw pioglitazone due to high risk of bladder cancer. This suspension was based on the results of an epidemiological study conducted by the French National Health Insurance. According to the results of the epidemiological study, the French agency found that patients, who were taking Actos for a long time to aid in type 2 diabetes mellitus, significantly increased risk of bladder cancer compared with patients who were taking other diabetes medications. On 10 June 2011, Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices also advised doctors not to prescribe the medication until further investigation of the cancer risk had been conducted. On 15 June 2011, the U.S. FDA announced that pioglitazone use for more than one year may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, and two months later the label was updated with an additional warning about this risk. A 2017 meta-analysis found no difference in the rates of bladder cancer attributed to pioglitazone. == Drug interactions == Combination with sulfonylureas or insulin reciprocally exponentiate risk of hypoglycemia. Therapy with pioglitazone increase the chance of pregnancy in individuals taking oral contraception. == Mechanism of action == Pioglitazone selectively stimulates the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) and to a lesser extent PPAR-α. It modulates the transcription of the genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism in the muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver. As a result, pioglitazone reduces insulin resistance in the liver and peripheral tissues, decreases gluconeogenesis in the liver, and reduces quantity of glucose and glycated hemoglobin in the bloodstream. More recently, pioglitazone and other active TZDs have been shown to bind to the outer mitochondrial membrane protein mitoNEET with affinity comparable to that of pioglitazone for PPARγ. Leriglitazone is a metabolite. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2008, it generated the tenth-highest amount of money for a medication in the U.S. in 2008, with sales exceeding $2.4 billion. To 2020, no study has examined the socioeconomic effects of utilization of pioglitazone. === Brand names === Pioglitazone is marketed as Actos in the United States, Canada, the UK and Germany, Glustin in the European Union, Glizone and Pioz in India by Zydus Cadila and USV Limited, respectively and Zactos in Mexico by Takeda Pharmaceuticals. On 17 August 2012, the US FDA announced its approval of the first generic version of Actos. == Research == === Psychiatry === ==== Bipolar disorder ==== Pioglitazone has been repurposed as an add-on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder. However, meta-analytic evidence is based on very few studies and does not suggest any efficacy of pioglitazone in the treatment of bipolar depression. ==== Major depression ==== There is research that suggests that pioglitazone may be useful for treating major depression. === Other illnesses === Pioglitazone has been found to exert anti-ageing effects in Drosophila. Pioglitazone has been tried for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, showing promising results according to several meta-analyses. Because it is thought to reduce inflammatory activity in neuroglia, it was studied in a small clinical trial involving children with autism, under the autoimmune/inflammatory hypotheses of the causes of autism. Pioglitazone may improve symptoms of psoriasis. Pioglitazone is also being researched as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease in preclinical studies, however testing for the efficacy of Pioglitazone has been fraught with failure and confusing results from clinical trials. Pioglitazone has been shown in animal models to be a possible treatment for Opioid use disorder. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
327	Urobilin	WIKIPEDIA	"Urobilin or urochrome is the chemical primarily responsible for the yellow color of urine. It is a linear tetrapyrrole compound that, along with the related colorless compound urobilinogen, are degradation products of the cyclic tetrapyrrole heme. == Metabolism == Urobilin is generated from the degradation of heme, which is first degraded through biliverdin to bilirubin. Bilirubin is then excreted as bile, which is further degraded by microbes present in the large intestine to urobilinogen. The enzyme responsible for the degradation is bilirubin reductase, which was identified in 2024. Some of this remains in the large intestine, and its conversion to stercobilin gives feces their brown color. Some is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and then delivered to the kidneys. When urobilinogen is exposed to air, it is oxidized to urobilin, which has a yellow color. == Importance == Many urine tests (urinalysis) monitor the amount of urobilin in urine, as its levels can give insight on the effectiveness of urinary tract function. Normally, urine would appear as either light yellow or colorless. A lack of water intake, for example following sleep or dehydration, reduces the water content of urine, thereby concentrating urobilin and producing a darker color of urine. Obstructive jaundice reduces biliary bilirubin excretion, which is then excreted directly from the blood stream into the urine, giving a dark-colored urine but with a paradoxically low urobilin concentration, no urobilinogen, and usually with correspondingly pale faeces. Darker urine can also be due to other chemicals, such as various ingested dietary components or drugs, porphyrins in patients with porphyria, and homogentisate in patients with alkaptonuria. == See also == Bile pigment Bilirubin Biliverdin Heme Stercobilin Urobilinogen == References == == Further reading == Bishop, Michael; Duben-Engelkirk, Janet L., and Fody, Edward P.

330	Ile-thr	PUBMED	 THE TITLE PEPTIDE [SYSTEMATIC NAME: 4-(butan-2-yl)-7,20-bis-(1-hy-droxy-eth-yl)-10,23-bis-(propan-2-yl)-12,25-dithia-3,6,9,16,19,22,27,28-octa-aza-tricyclo-[22.2.1.1(11,14)]octa-cosa-1(26),11(28),13,24(27)-tetra-ene-2,5,8,15,18,21-hexone acetonitrile monosolvate], C(32)H(48)N(8)O(8)S(2)·CH(3)CN, an analogue of ascidiacyclamide (ASC) [cyclo(-Ile-Oxz-D-Val-Thz-)(2)], lies about a twofold rotation axis, so that the glycine (Gly) and isoleucine (Ile) residues are each disordered over two sites with equal occupancies. The acetonitrile mol-ecule is also located on a twofold axis passing through the C and N atoms. In the peptide, the thia-zole rings are faced to each other with a dihedral angle of 9.63 (15)° and intra-molecular N-H⋯O and O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds are observed. A bifurcated N-H⋯(O,O) hydrogen bond links the peptide mol-ecules into a layer parallel to the ab plane. The abnormal Hb F-Porto Torres [Agamma75(E19)Ile-->Thr, 136(H14)Ala-->Ser] was observed during a cord blood survey for hemoglobinopathies in North Sardinia. This silent variant showed the same mobility as Hb F-Sardinia in isoelectric focusing (IEF) of the tetramers, whereas the abnormal globin chain was clearly separated by acid-urea-Triton polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AUT-PAGE) from the normal Ggamma- and Agamma-globin chains. Separation of the globin chains by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated the following percentages: Ggamma 68.4, Agamma 14.0, Xgamma 17.6, that strongly suggested the abnormal chain as being a variant of the Agamma-globin. Sequencing of the gamma-globin genes indicated that the mutated gene was in fact an Agamma with two nucleotide replacements, one being the ATA-->ACA (Ile-->Thr) at codon 75 (the so-called AgammaT of the rather common Hb F-Sardinia) and the second the GCA-->TCA (Ala-->Ser) at codon 136. This new variant is the seventh having the sequence of the AgammaT chain with an additional mutation so far described and the third characterized by gene sequencing. A simple thin-layer isoelectric focusing technique was used to separate Hb F-Sardinia, containing the A gamma T-globin chain, from the Hb F containing the G gamma- and the A gamma I-globin chains. The identity of the slow-moving Hb F fraction as Hb F-Sardinia was verified by PAGE. A negative correlation (R2 = 0.747, p less than 0.001) was found between the percent Hb F-Sardinia and percent G gamma-chain in homozygotes for beta-thalassemia. Of 31 Sardinian beta-thalassemic patients studied, 21 were homozygous and eight heterozygous for the A gamma T polymorphism with a gene frequency of 0.823. The mean values of Hb F-Sardinia were 39.1 +/- 5.9% for the homozygotes and 17.1 +/- 3.6% for the heterozygotes. The percentage of Hb F-Sardinia found in beta o-thalassemic newborns was similar to that of corresponding normal newborns who also had the A gamma T polymorphism. No measurable differences in the percent Hb F-Sardinia level were observed among beta o-thal patients who were polytransfused, beta o-thal patients studied before transfusion, and beta o-thal patients exhibiting the intermediate form of the disease who had never been transfused.

332	Simvastatin	WIKIPEDIA	"Simvastatin, sold under the brand name Zocor among others, is a statin, a type of lipid-lowering medication. It is used along with exercise, diet, and weight loss to decrease elevated lipid levels. It is also used to decrease the risk of heart problems in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include constipation, headaches, and nausea. Serious side effects may include muscle breakdown, liver problems, and increased blood sugar levels. A lower dose may be needed in people with kidney problems. There is evidence of harm to the developing baby when taken during pregnancy and it should not be used by those who are breastfeeding. It is in the statin class of medications and works by decreasing the manufacture of cholesterol by the liver. Simvastatin is made from the fungus Aspergillus terreus. It was patented by Merck in 1980, and came into medical use in 1992. Simvastatin is available as a generic medication, and is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the nineteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 26 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == The primary uses of simvastatin are to treat dyslipidemia and to prevent atherosclerosis-related complications such as stroke and heart attacks in those who are at high risk. It is recommended to be used as an addition to a low-cholesterol diet. In heart protection studies, simvastatin showed the ability to lower LDL cholesterol by about 1·5 mmol/L, which resulted in substantial reductions in mortality rates. Simvastatin also reduced the numbers of other events like heart attacks, strokes, and revascularizations and MI significantly. The Heart Protection Study evaluated the effects of simvastatin in people with risk factors including existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or stroke, but having relatively low LDL cholesterol. In this trial, which lasted 5.4 years, overall mortality was reduced by 13% and cardiovascular mortality was reduced by 18%. People receiving simvastatin experienced 38% fewer nonfatal heart attacks and 25% fewer strokes. Statins in general have been proposed as beneficial in reducing the progression of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Multiple observational studies have been conducted to analyse the benefits of statin use in delaying the progression of AMD but have resulted in conflicting outcomes. Given the current available information, simvastatin should not be recommended solely for the treatment of AMD. == Contraindications == Simvastatin is contraindicated with pregnancy, breastfeeding, and liver disease. Pregnancy must be avoided while on simvastatin due to potentially severe birth defects. Patients cannot breastfeed while on simvastatin due to potentially disrupting the infant's lipid metabolism. High doses of simvastatin are also contraindicated with the widely used antihypertensive amlodipine. A lower dose is also recommended in people taking the calcium channel blockers, verapamil and diltiazem, as well as those taking amiodarone. == Adverse effects == Common side effects (>1% incidence) may include indigestion and eczema. There is evidence to suggest that rare side effects such as joint pain, memory loss, and muscle cramps are more likely to occur in patients who take higher doses of simvastatin. Cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscles and blockade of renal system), and myositis have been reported in patients receiving the drug chronically. Serious allergic reactions to simvastatin are rare. A type of DNA variant known as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may help predict individuals prone to developing myopathy when taking simvastatin; a study ultimately including 32,000 patients concluded the carriers of one or two risk alleles of a particular SNP, rs4149056, were at a five-fold or 16-fold increased risk, respectively. In 2012, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has released guidelines regarding the use of rs4149056 genotype in guiding dosing of simvastatin and updated the guideline in 2014. In March 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its guidance for statin users to address reports of memory loss, liver damage, increased blood sugar, development of type 2 diabetes, and muscle injury. The new guidance indicates: FDA has found that liver injury associated with statin use is rare but can occur. The reports about memory loss, forgetfulness, and confusion span all statin products and all age groups. The FDA says these experiences are rare, but that those affected often report feeling ""fuzzy"" or unfocused in their thinking. A small increased risk of raised blood sugar levels and the development of type 2 diabetes have been reported with the use of statins. A 2010 published meta-analysis found for every 255 patients taking a statin for 4 years, one additional case of diabetes would occur whilst preventing 5.4 major coronary events. Some drugs interact with statins in a way that increases the risk of muscle injury called myopathy, characterized by unexplained muscle weakness or pain. On 19 March 2010, the FDA issued another statement regarding simvastatin, saying it increases the risk of muscle injury (myopathy) when taken at high doses or at lower doses in combination with other drugs. The highest dose rate causes muscle damage in 610 of every 10,000 people in contrast to a lower dose, which causes muscle damage in eight of 10,000 people. The FDA warning, released again on 8 June 2011, suggested that high-dose ""simvastatin should be used only in patients who have been taking this dose for 12 months or more without evidence of muscle injury"" and that it ""should not be started in new patients, including patients already taking lower doses of the drug."" == Interactions == Simvastatin has important interactions with grapefruit juice and other drugs, including some that are commonly used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. These interactions are clinically important because increasing simvastatin serum levels above those normally provided by the maximum recommended dose increases the risk of muscle damage, including the otherwise rare and potentially fatal side effect of rhabdomyolysis. Consuming large amounts of grapefruit juice increases serum levels of simvastatin by up to three-fold, increasing the risk of side effects. The FDA recommends that people taking statins should avoid consuming more than a quart (946 ml) of grapefruit juice per day. Simvastatin also interacts with other drugs, including some used to treat cardiovascular problems. It should not be taken by people who are also taking the antifungal drugs fluconazole, itraconazole, or posaconazole; the antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or telithromycin; HIV protease inhibitors; the antidepressant nefazodone; the cardiovascular drug gemfibrozil; the immunosuppressant ciclosporin, or the endometriosis drug danazol. Reduced maximum doses of simvastatin apply for patients taking certain other drugs, including the cardiovascular drugs verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, amlodipine, and ranolazine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === All statins act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase. HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, the metabolic pathway responsible for the endogenous production of cholesterol. Statins are more effective than other lipid-regulating drugs at lowering LDL-cholesterol concentration, but they are less effective than the fibrates in reducing triglyceride concentration. However, statins reduce cardiovascular disease events and total mortality irrespective of the initial cholesterol concentration. This is a major piece of evidence that statins work in another way than the lowering of cholesterol (called pleiotropic effects). Simvastatin is an effective serum lipid-lowering drug that can decrease low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels by up to 50%. Simvastatin had been shown to interact with lipid-lowering transcription factor PPAR-alpha and that interaction might control the neurotrophic action of the drug. === Pharmacokinetics === The drug is in the form of an inactive lactone that is hydrolyzed after ingestion to produce the active β-hydroxyacid form. Simvastatin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 yielding products which are also active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. == History == The development of simvastatin was closely linked with lovastatin. Biochemist Jesse Huff and his colleagues at Merck began researching the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the early 1950s. In 1956, mevalonic acid was isolated from a yeast extract by Karl Folkers, Carl Hoffman, and others at Merck, while Huff and his associates confirmed that mevalonic acid was an intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis. In 1959, the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme (a major contributor of internal cholesterol production) was discovered by researchers at the Max Planck Institute. This discovery encouraged scientists worldwide to find an effective inhibitor of this enzyme. By 1976, Akira Endo had isolated the first inhibitor, mevastatin, from the fungus Penicillium citrinium while working at Daiichi Sankyo in Japan. In 1979, Hoffman and colleagues isolated lovastatin from a strain of the fungus Aspergillus terreus. While developing and researching lovastatin, Merck scientists synthetically derived a more potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor from a fermentation product of A. terreus, which was designated MK-733 (later to be named simvastatin). In 1994, publication of the results of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) provided the first unequivocal evidence that lowering LDL cholesterol via statin treatment reduces cardiovascular events and overall mortality. A total of 4,444 people with coronary heart disease and blood cholesterol levels from 5.5 to 8.0 mmol/L were randomized to simvastatin treatment or placebo and followed for an average of 5 years. Compared to the placebo group, those treated with simvastatin experienced a 30% decrease in overall mortality, a 42% reduction in coronary death, a 34% reduction in major coronary events, and a 37% reduction in revascularization procedures. == Society and culture == === Economics === Prior to losing US patent protection, simvastatin was Merck & Co.'s largest-selling drug. Under provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the United States, health plans may cover the costs of simvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg for adults aged 40–75 years based on United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. Zocor had an original patent expiry date in December 2005, but was extended by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to expire in June 2006. === Brand names === Simvastatin was initially marketed by Merck & Co under the brand name Zocor but is available generically in most countries following the patent expiry. A combination of simvastatin along with ezetimibe is sold under the brand name Vytorin and is jointly marketed by Merck and Schering-Plough. Brand names include Zocor, Zocor Heart Pro, marketed by the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co., Simlup, Simvotin, Simcard (India), Denan (Germany), Liponorm, Sinvacor, Sivastin (Italy), Lipovas (Japan), Lodales (France), Zocord (Austria and Sweden), Zimstat, Simvahexal (Australia), Lipex (Australia and New Zealand), Simvastatin-Teva, Simvacor, Simvaxon, Simovil (Israel), available in Thailand under the brand Bestatin manufactured by Berlin Pharmaceutical Industry Co Ltd and others. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -3.1281633e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
335	4-hydroxytamoxifen	WIKIPEDIA	Afimoxifene, also known as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) and by its tentative brand name TamoGel, is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of the triphenylethylene group and an active metabolite of tamoxifen. The drug is under development under the tentative brand name TamoGel as a topical gel for the treatment of hyperplasia of the breast. It has completed a phase II clinical trial for cyclical mastalgia, but further studies are required before afimoxifene can be approved for this indication and marketed. Afimoxifene is a SERM and hence acts as a tissue-selective agonist–antagonist of the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ with mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity depending on the tissue. It is also an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) with relatively low affinity (100–1,000 nM, relative to 3–6 nM for estradiol). In addition to its estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, afimoxifene has been found to act as an antagonist of the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) ERRβ and ERRγ. == See also == List of investigational sex-hormonal agents § Estrogenics List of selective estrogen receptor modulators == References == == External links == 4-hydroxytamoxifen at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Afimoxifene - AdisInsight	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.6240566e-06, 'ICAL': 0.0}
343	4-epi-6-epi doxycycline	PUBMED	 Minocycline and doxycycline both are second-generation tetracycline antibiotics with similar chemical structures and comparable antibacterial spectrum. Minocycline has also emerged as the tetracycline of choice for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections, although doxycycline has also shown the activity. Minocycline showed promising results in experimental neurology, which was due to its highly lipophilic nature. It is clinically safe and effective adjunct to antipsychotic medications. The objective of the current review is to provide clinical and preclinical, non-antibiotic uses of minocycline as well as doxycycline. Relevant literature covers antibiotic actions but is more specifically concerned with the non-antibiotic biological aspect of tetracyclines. Non-antibiotic biological effects for both the antibiotics were identified through searching relevant databases including: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to 2020, using the keywords 'minocycline and doxycycline'. Anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic neuroprotective, immunomodulatory and the number of other non-antibiotic effects were compiled for minocycline and doxycycline. Doxycycline and minocycline are second-generation tetracyclines. They are readily absorbed, distributed throughout the organism as a function of their lipophilicity and eliminated in both the urine and the faeces. The influence of age, renal disease, malnutrition and hyperlipidaemia is reviewed, together with the main pharmacokinetic interactions. A number of reviews have stated that tetracyclines are contraindicated during breastfeeding because of possible staining of infants’ dental enamel or bone deposition of tetracyclines. However, a close examination of available literature indicates that there is not likely to be harm in short-term use of doxycycline during lactation because milk levels are low and absorption by the infant is inhibited by the calcium in breastmilk. Doxycycline use in children <8 years is now considered acceptable in courses up to 21 days. As a theoretical precaution, avoid prolonged (>21 days) or repeat courses during nursing. Monitor the infant for rash and for possible effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea or candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
344	Rifampicin	WIKIPEDIA	"Rifampicin, also known as rifampin, is an ansamycin antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections, including tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium avium complex, leprosy, and Legionnaires' disease. It is almost always used together with other antibiotics with two notable exceptions: when given as a ""preferred treatment that is strongly recommended"" for latent TB infection; and when used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcal disease in people who have been exposed to those bacteria. Before treating a person for a long period of time, measurements of liver enzymes and blood counts are recommended. Rifampicin may be given either by mouth or intravenously. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. It often turns urine, sweat, and tears a red or orange color. Liver problems or allergic reactions may occur. It is part of the recommended treatment of active tuberculosis during pregnancy, though its safety in pregnancy is not known. Rifampicin is of the rifamycin group of antibiotics. It works by decreasing the production of RNA by bacteria. Rifampicin was discovered in 1965, marketed in Italy in 1968, and approved in the United States in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies rifampicin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. Rifampicin is made by the soil bacterium Amycolatopsis rifamycinica. == Medical uses == === Mycobacteria === Rifampicin is used for the treatment of tuberculosis in combination with other antibiotics, such as pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and ethambutol. For the treatment of tuberculosis, it is administered daily for at least six months. Combination therapy is used to prevent the development of resistance and to shorten the length of treatment. Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to rifampicin develops quickly when it is used without another antibiotic, with laboratory estimates of resistance rates from 10−7 to 10−10 per tuberculosis bacterium per generation. Rifampicin can be used alone in patients with latent tuberculosis infections to prevent or delay the development of active disease because only small numbers of bacteria are present. A Cochrane review found no difference in efficacy between a 3- to 4-month regimen of rifampicin and a 6-month regimen of isoniazid for preventing active tuberculosis in patients not infected with HIV, and patients who received rifampicin had a lower rate of hepatotoxicity. However, the quality of the evidence was judged to be low. A shorter 2-month course of rifampicin and pyrazinamide had previously been recommended but is no longer recommended due to high rates of hepatotoxicity. Rifampicin should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water. It is generally taken either at least one hour before meals or two hours after meals. Rifampicin is also used to treat nontuberculous mycobacterial infections including leprosy (Hansen's disease) and Mycobacterium kansasii. With multidrug therapy used as the standard treatment of Hansen's disease, rifampicin is always used in combination with dapsone and clofazimine to avoid causing drug resistance. It is also used in the treatment of Mycobacterium ulcerans infections as associated with Buruli ulcer, usually in combination with clarithromycin or other antibiotics. === Other bacteria and protozoans === In 2008, tentative evidence showed rifampicin may be useful in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in combination with other antibiotics, including in difficult-to-treat infections such as osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infections. As of 2012, if rifampicin combination therapy was useful for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis was unclear. A meta-analysis concluded that adding adjunctive rifampicin to a β-lactam or vancomycin may improve outcomes in staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. However, a more recent trial found no benefit from adjunctive rifampicin. It is also used as preventive treatment against Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal) infections. Rifampicin is also recommended as an alternative treatment for infections by the tick-borne pathogens Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum when treatment with doxycycline is contraindicated, such as in pregnant women or in patients with a history of allergy to tetracycline antibiotics. It is also sometimes used to treat infections by Listeria species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Legionella pneumophila. For these nonstandard indications, antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be done (if possible) before starting rifampicin therapy. The Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas species are intrinsically resistant to rifampicin. It has been used with amphotericin B in largely unsuccessful attempts to treat primary amoebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri. Rifampicin can be used as monotherapy for a few days as prophylaxis against meningitis, but resistance develops quickly during long-term treatment of active infections, so the drug is always used against active infections in combination with other antibiotics. Rifampicin is relatively ineffective against spirochetes, which has led to its use as a selective agent capable of isolating them in materials being cultured in laboratories. === Viruses === Rifampicin has some effectiveness against vaccinia virus. === Pathogen susceptibility === The minimum inhibitory concentrations of rifampicin for several medically significant pathogens are: Mycobacterium tuberculosis — 0.002 – 64 μg/mL Mycobacterium bovis — 0.125 μg/mL Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant) — ≤ 0.006–256 μg/mL Chlamydia pneumoniae — 0.005 μg/mL === Primary biliary cholangitis === Rifampicin is used to treat itchiness caused by primary biliary cholangitis. The treatment-related adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hemolysis, and interactions with other drugs. For those reasons as well as some ethical concerns regarding off-label use of antibiotics, rifampin as a very effective preventive antibiotic for meningitis, is not considered appropriate for itchiness. === Hidradenitis suppurativa === Rifampicin with clindamycin has been used to treat the skin disease hidradenitis suppurativa. == Adverse effects == The most serious adverse effect is hepatotoxicity, and people receiving it often undergo baseline and frequent liver function tests to detect early liver damage. The more common side effects include fever, gastrointestinal disturbances, rashes, and immunological reactions. Taking rifampicin usually causes certain bodily fluids, such as urine, sweat, and tears, to become orange-red in color, a benign side effect that nonetheless can be frightening if it is not expected. This may also be used to monitor effective absorption of the drug (if drug color is not seen in the urine, the patient may wish to move the drug dose farther in time from food or milk intake). The discolorization of sweat and tears is not directly noticeable, but sweat may stain light clothing orange, and tears may permanently stain soft contact lenses. Since rifampicin may be excreted in breast milk, breastfeeding should be avoided while it is being taken. Other adverse effects include: Liver toxicity—hepatitis, liver failure in severe cases Respiratory—breathlessness Cutaneous—flushing, pruritus, rash, hyperpigmentation, redness and watering of eyes Abdominal — nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea Flu-like symptoms—chills, fever, headache, arthralgia, and malaise. Rifampicin has good penetration into the brain, and this may directly explain some malaise and dysphoria in a minority of users. Allergic reaction—rashes, itching, swelling of the tongue or throat, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing == Chemical structure == Rifampicin is a polyketide belonging to the chemical class of compounds termed ansamycins, so named because of their heterocyclic structure containing a naphthoquinone core spanned by an aliphatic ansa chain. The naphthoquinonic chromophore gives rifampicin its characteristic red-orange crystalline color. The critical functional groups of rifampicin in its inhibitory binding of bacterial RNA polymerase are the four critical hydroxyl groups of the ansa bridge and the naphthol ring, which form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues on the protein. Rifampicin is the 3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-iminomethyl derivative of rifamycin SV. == Interactions == Rifampicin is the most powerful known inducer of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system, including isoenzymes CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. It increases metabolism of many drugs and as a consequence, can make them less effective, or even ineffective, by decreasing their levels. For instance, patients undergoing long-term anticoagulation therapy with warfarin have to increase their dosage of warfarin and have their clotting time checked frequently because failure to do so could lead to inadequate anticoagulation, resulting in serious consequences of thromboembolism. Rifampicin can reduce the efficacy of birth control pills or other hormonal contraception by its induction of the cytochrome P450 system, to the extent that unintended pregnancies have occurred in women who use oral contraceptives and took rifampicin even for very short courses (for example, as prophylaxis against exposure to bacterial meningitis). Other interactions include decreased levels and less effectiveness of antiretroviral agents, everolimus, atorvastatin, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, celecoxib, clarithromycin, caspofungin, voriconazole, and lorazepam. Rifampicin is antagonistic to the microbiologic effects of the antibiotics gentamicin and amikacin. The activity of rifampicin against some species of mycobacteria can be potentiated by isoniazid (through inhibiting mycolate synthesis) and ambroxol (through host directed effects in autophagy and pharmacokinetics). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA synthesis by inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Crystal structure data and biochemical data suggest that rifampicin binds to the pocket of the RNA polymerase β subunit within the DNA/RNA channel, but away from the active site. The inhibitor prevents RNA synthesis by physically blocking elongation, and thus preventing synthesis of host bacterial proteins. By this ""steric-occlusion"" mechanism, rifampicin blocks synthesis of the second or third phosphodiester bond between the nucleotides in the RNA backbone, preventing elongation of the 5' end of the RNA transcript past more than two or three nucleotides. In a recent study rifampicin was shown to bind to cytochrome P450 reductase and alter its conformation as well as activity towards supporting metabolism of progesterone via CYP21A2. === Mechanism of resistance === Resistance to rifampicin arises from mutations that alter residues of the rifampicin binding site on RNA polymerase, resulting in decreased affinity for rifampicin. Resistance mutations map to the rpoB gene, encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. The majority of resistance mutations in E. coli are in 3 clusters on rpoB. Cluster I is amino acids 509 to 533, cluster II is amino acids 563 to 572, and cluster III is amino acid 687. When describing mutations in rpoB in other species, the corresponding amino acid number in E. coli is usually used. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the majority of mutations leading to rifampicin resistance are in cluster I, in a 81bp hotspot core region called RRDR for ""rifampcin resistance determining region"". A change in amino acid 531 from serine to leucine arising from a change in the DNA sequence of TCG to TTG is the most common mutation. Tuberculosis resistance has also occurred due to mutations in the N-terminal region of rpoB and cluster III. An alternative mechanism of resistance is through Arr-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of rifampicin. With the assistance of the enzyme Arr produced by the pathogen Mycobacterium smegmatis, ADP-ribose is added to rifampicin at one of its ansa chain hydroxy groups, thereby inactivating the drug. === Resistance in tuberculosis === Mycobacterial resistance to rifampicin may occur alone or along with resistance to other first-line antitubercular drugs. Early detection of such multidrug or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is critical in improving patient outcomes by instituting appropriate second-line treatments, and in decreasing transmission of drug-resistant TB. Traditional methods of detecting resistance involve mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing, results of which could take up to 6 weeks. Xpert MTB/RIF assay is an automated test that can detect rifampicin resistance, and also diagnose tuberculosis. A Cochrane review updated in 2014 and 2021 concluded that for rifampicin resistance detection, Xpert MTB/RIF was accurate, that is (95%) sensitive and (98%) specific. === Pharmacokinetics === Orally administered rifampicin results in peak plasma concentrations in about 2–4 hours. 4-Aminosalicylic acid (another antituberculosis drug) significantly reduces absorption of rifampicin, and peak concentrations may be lower. If these two drugs must be used concurrently, they must be given separately, with an interval of 8 to 12 hours between administrations. Rifampicin is easily absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; its ester functional group is quickly hydrolyzed in bile, and it is catalyzed by a high pH and substrate-specific esterases. After about 6 hours, almost all of the drug is deacetylated. Even in this deacetylated form, rifampicin is still a potent antibiotic; however, it can no longer be reabsorbed by the intestines and is eliminated from the body. Only about 7% of the administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine, though urinary elimination accounts for only about 30% of the drug excretion. About 60% to 65% is excreted through feces. The half-life of rifampicin ranges from 1.5 to 5.0 hours, though hepatic impairment significantly increases it. Food consumption inhibits its absorption from the GI tract, and the drug is more quickly eliminated. When rifampicin is taken with a meal, its peak blood concentration falls by 36%. Antacids do not affect its absorption. The decrease in rifampicin absorption with food is sometimes enough to noticeably affect urine color, which can be used as a marker for whether or not a dose of the drug has been effectively absorbed. Distribution of the drug is high throughout the body, and reaches effective concentrations in many organs and body fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid. Since the substance itself is red, this high distribution is the reason for the orange-red color of the saliva, tears, sweat, urine, and feces. About 60% to 90% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. == Use in biotechnology == Rifampicin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase, and is commonly used to inhibit the synthesis of host bacterial proteins during recombinant protein expression in bacteria. RNA encoding for the recombinant gene is usually transcribed from DNA by a viral T7 RNA polymerase, which is not affected by rifampicin. == History == In 1957, a soil sample from a pine forest on the French Riviera was brought for analysis to the Lepetit Pharmaceuticals research lab in Milan, Italy. There, a research group headed by Piero Sensi and Maria Teresa Timbal discovered a new bacterium. This new species produced a new class of molecules with antibiotic activity. Because Sensi, Timbal and the researchers were particularly fond of the French crime story Rififi (about a jewel heist and rival gangs), they decided to call these compounds rifamycins. After two years of attempts to obtain more stable semisynthetic products, a new molecule with high efficacy and good tolerability was produced in 1965 and was named rifampicin. Rifampicin was first sold in Italy in 1968 and was approved by the FDA in 1971. == Society and culture == === Cancer-causing impurities === In August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became aware of nitrosamine impurities in certain samples of rifampin. The FDA and manufacturers are investigating the origin of these impurities in rifampin, and the agency is developing testing methods for regulators and industry to detect the 1-methyl-4-nitrosopiperazine (MNP). MNP belongs to the nitrosamine class of compounds, some of which are classified as probable or possible human carcinogens (substances that could cause cancer), based on laboratory tests such as rodent carcinogenicity studies. Although there are no data available to directly evaluate the carcinogenic potential of MNP, information available on closely related nitrosamine compounds was used to calculate lifetime exposure limits for MNP. As of January 2021, the FDA continues to investigate the presence of 1-methyl-4-nitrosopiperazine (MNP) in rifampin or 1-cyclopentyl-4-nitrosopiperazine (CPNP) in rifapentine approved for sale in the US. === Names === Rifampicin is the INN and BAN, while rifampin is the USAN. Rifampicin may be abbreviated R, RMP, RA, RF, or RIF (US). Rifampicin is also known as rifaldazine, rofact, and rifampin in the United States, also as rifamycin SV. Its chemical name is 5,6,9,17,19,21-hexahydroxy-23-methoxy-2,4,12,16,18,20,22-heptamethyl-8-[N-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)formimidoyl]-2,7-(epoxypentadeca[1,11,13]trienimino)-naphtho[2,1-b]furan-1,11(2H)-dione 21-acetate. Rifampicin is available under many brand names worldwide. == References == == External links == ""Nitrosamine impurities in medications: Guidance"". Health Canada. 4 April 2022."

346	Thymidine	WIKIPEDIA	"Thymidine (symbol dT or dThd), also known as deoxythymidine, deoxyribosylthymine, or thymine deoxyriboside, is a pyrimidine deoxynucleoside. Deoxythymidine is the DNA nucleoside T, which pairs with deoxyadenosine (A) in double-stranded DNA. In cell biology it is used to synchronize the cells in G1/early S phase. The prefix deoxy- is often left out since there are no precursors of thymine nucleotides involved in RNA synthesis. Before the boom in thymidine use caused by the need for thymidine in the production of the antiretroviral drug azidothymidine (AZT), much of the world's thymidine production came from herring sperm. Thymidine occurs almost exclusively in DNA but it also occurs in the T-loop of tRNA. == Structure and properties == In its composition, deoxythymidine is a nucleoside composed of deoxyribose (a pentose sugar) joined to the pyrimidine base thymine. Deoxythymidine can be phosphorylated with one, two or three phosphoric acid groups, creating dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate), dTDP, or dTTP (for the di- and tri- phosphates, respectively). It exists in solid form as small white crystals or white crystalline powder. It has a molecular weight of 242.229 Da and a melting point of 185 °C. The stability of deoxythymidine under standard temperature and pressure (STP) is very high. Deoxythymidine is non-toxic and is part of one of the four nucleosides in DNA. It is a naturally occurring compound that exists in all living organisms and DNA viruses. Instead of thymidine, RNA contains uridine (uracil joined to ribose). Uracil is chemically very similar to thymine, which is also known as 5-methyluracil. Since thymine nucleotides are precursors of DNA (but not RNA), the prefix ""deoxy"" is often left out, i.e., deoxythymidine is often just called thymidine. Thymidine is listed as a chemical teratogen. == Modified analogs == Iododeoxyuridine is a radiosensitizer and increases the amount of DNA damage received from ionizing radiation. Azidothymidine (AZT) – used in the treatment of HIV infection. AZT inhibits the process of reverse transcription, a critical step in the viral life cycle. Radiolabeled thymidine (TdR), such as tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR), is commonly used in cell proliferation assays. The thymidine is incorporated into dividing cells and the level of this incorporation, measured using a liquid scintillation counter, is proportional to the amount of cell proliferation. For example, lymphocyte proliferation can be measured this way in lymphoproliferative disorders. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is another thymidine analog that is often used for the detection of proliferating cells in living tissues. 5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) is a thymidine analog which is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells and is used to assay DNA synthesis in cell culture or living tissues. It can be visualized by covalently binding a fluorescent azide using click chemistry, which is less harsh than the conditions used to expose the epitope for BrdU antibodies. Edoxudine is an antiviral drug. Telbivudine (β-L-2′-deoxythymidine, LdT) is the unmodified ""unnatural"" L-enantiomer of thymidine that was used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. == Thymidine imbalance induces mutation and recombination == During growth of bacteriophage T4, an excess of thymidine availability increases mutation. A deficiency of thymidine during growth also increases mutation. A thymidylate auxotroph of the diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown under conditions in which thymidyate levels varied from excess to depletion. High levels of thymidylate were observed to be mutagenic and recombinogenic, whereas starvation for thymidylate was recombinogenic but only slightly mutagenic. == References == == External links == http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/11/05/74308/index.htm"	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.04166375, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -9.0883464e-07, ' MED': -1.6762922e-05, 'ICAL': 0.0}
347	Deuteroporphyrin	PUBMED	 Two soluble heme analogs of the insoluble malaria pigment hematin anhydride (HA, or β-hematin), [Fe(III)(protoporphyrin)] A series of metallo-deuteroporphyrins derived from hemin were prepared as models of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. With the aid of the highly active Co(II) deuteroporphyrin complex, the catalytic oxidation system was applied for the oxidation of several lignin model compounds, and high yields of monomeric products were obtained under mild reaction conditions. It was found that the modified cobalt deuteroporphyrin that has no substituents at the meso sites but does have the disulfide linkage in the propionate side chains at the β sites exhibited much higher activity and stability than the synthetic tetraphenylporphyrin. The changes in the propionate side chains can divert the reactivity of cobalt deuteroporphyrins from the typical CC bond cleavage to CO bond cleavage. Furthermore, this novel oxidative system can convert enzymolysis lignin into depolymerized products including a significant portion of well-defined aromatic monomers. Magnesium protoporphyrin chelatase catalyzes the insertion of a Mg(2+) ion into protoporphyrin IX, which can be considered as the first committed step of (bacterio)chlorophyll synthesis. In the present work, the Mg chelatase H subunits from both Synechocystis and Rhodobacter sphaeroides were studied because of the differing requirements of these organisms for modified cyclic tetrapyrroles. Deuteroporphyrin was shown to be a substrate for Mg chelatase. Analytical HPLC gel filtration was used to show that an H-deuteroporphyrin complex can be reconstituted by incubating the magnesium chelatase H subunit with a molar excess of deuteroporphyrin and that these complexes are monomers. The binding process occurs in the absence of Mg(2+) or ATP or the I or D subunits of Mg chelatase. The emission from Trp residues in the H subunit is partly quenched when deuteroporphyrin is bound. Quantitative analysis of Trp fluorescence quenching led to determination of the K(d) values for deuteroporphyrin binding to BchH from Rb. sphaeroides and ChlH from Synechocystis, which are 1.22 +/- 0.42 microM and 0.53 +/- 0.12 microM for ChlH and BchH, respectively. In the case of ChlH, but not BchH, the K(d) increased 4-fold in the presence of MgATP(2-). Red shifts in absorbance and excitation peaks were observed in the B band of the bound porphyrin in comparison with deuteroporphyrin in solution, as well as reduced yield and red shifts of up to 8 nm in fluorescence emission. These alterations are consistent with a slightly deformed nonplanar conformation of the bound porphyrin. Mg deuteroporphyrin, the product of the Mg chelation reaction, was shown to form a complex with either ChlH or BchH; in each case the K(d) for Mg deuteroporphyrin is similar to that for deuteroporphyrin. The implications of the H-Mg protoporphyrin interaction for the next enzyme in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, Mg protoporphyrin methyltransferase, are discussed.

348	Lumichrome	PUBMED	 Lumichrome and riboflavin are novel molecules from rhizobial exudates that stimulate plant growth. Reported studies have revealed major developmental changes elicited by lumichrome at very low nanomolar concentrations (5 nM) in plants, which include early initiation of trifoliate leaves, expansion of unifoliate and trifoliate leaves, increased stem elongation and leaf area, and consequently greater biomass accumulation in monocots and dicots. But higher lumichrome concentration (50 nM) depressed root development and reduced growth of unifoliate and second trifoliate leaves. While the mechanisms remain unknown, it is possible that lumichrome released by rhizobia induced the biosynthesis of classical phytohormones that caused the observed developmental changes in plants. We also showed in earlier studies that applying either 10 nM lumichrome, 10 nM ABA, or 10 ml of infective rhizobial cells (0.2 OD600) to roots of monocots and dicots for 44 h produced identical effects, which included decreased stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration in Bambara groundnut, soybean, and maize, increased stomatal conductance and transpiration in cowpea and lupin, and elevated root respiration in maize (19% by rhizobia and 20% by lumichrome). Greater extracellular exudation of lumichrome, riboflavin and indole acetic acid by N2-fixing rhizobia over non-fixing bacteria is perceived to be an indication of their role as symbiotic signals. This is evidenced by the increased concentration of lumichrome and riboflavin in the xylem sap of cowpea and soybean plants inoculated with infective rhizobia. In fact, greater xylem concentration of lumichrome in soybean and its correspondingly increased accumulation in leaves was found to result in dramatic developmental changes than in cowpea. Furthermore, lumichrome and riboflavin secreted by soil rhizobia are also known to function as (i) ecological cues for sensing environmental stress, (ii) growth factors for microbes, plants, and humans, (iii) signals for stomatal functioning in land plants, and (iv) protectants/elicitors of plant defense. The fact that exogenous application of ABA to plant roots caused the same effect as lumichrome on leaf stomatal functioning suggests molecular cross-talk in plant response to environmental stimuli. Lumichrome is a photodegradation product of riboflavin and is available as a photosensitizer and fluorescent dye. To develop new efficient methods of lumichrome production, we isolated bacterial strains with high lumichrome productivity from soil. The strain with highest productivity was identified as Microbacterium sp. strain TPU 3598. Since this strain inductively produced lumichrome when cultivated with riboflavin, we developed two different methods, a cultivation method and a resting cell method, for the production of large amounts of lumichrome using the strain. In the cultivation method, 2.4 g (9.9 mmol) of lumichrome was produced from 3.8 g (10.1 mmol) of riboflavin at the 500-ml scale (98% yield). The strain also produced 4.7 g (19.4 mmol) of lumichrome from 7.6 g (20.2 mmol) of riboflavin (96% yield) by addition of riboflavin during cultivation at the 500-ml scale. In the resting cell method, 20 g of cells (wet weight) in 100 ml of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, produced 2.4 g of lumichrome from 3.8 g of riboflavin (98% yield). Since the lumichrome production by these methods was carried out in suspension, the resulting lumichrome was easily purified from the cultivation medium or reaction mixture by centrifugation and crystallization. Thus, the biochemical methods we describe here are a significant improvement in terms of simplicity and yield over the existing chemical, photolytic, and other biochemical methods of lumichrome production. Lumichrome, a major derivative of riboflavin, may exhibit pharmacological activity against cancer cells. Riboflavin is a vitamin found in food, however, certain evidence has suggested its possible potentiating effects on cancer progression. Here, we have shown for the first time that unlike riboflavin, lumichrome can suppress lung cancer cell growth and reduce survival in both normal and anchorage-independent conditions. In addition, lumichrome induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells via a p53-dependent mitochondrial mechanism with substantial selectivity, shown by its lesser toxicity to the normal primary dermal papilla cells. The potency of lumichrome in killing lung cancer cells was found to be comparable to that of cisplatin, a standard chemotherapeutic drug for lung cancer treatment. With regard to the mechanism, lumichrome significantly upregulated p53 and decreased its downstream target BCL-2. Such a shift of BCL-2 family protein balance further activated caspase-9 and -3 and finally executed apoptosis. Furthermore, lumichrome potentially suppressed cancer stem cells (CSCs) in lung cancer by dramatically suppressing CSC markers together with the CSC-maintaining cell signaling namely protein kinase B (AKT) and β-catenin. To conclude, the present study has unraveled a novel role and mechanism of lumichrome against lung cancer that may benefit the development of the compound for management of the disease.

350	Bilirubin	WIKIPEDIA	"Bilirubin (BR) (from the Latin for ""red bile"") is a red-orange compound that occurs in the normal catabolic pathway that breaks down heme in vertebrates. This catabolism is a necessary process in the body's clearance of waste products that arise from the destruction of aged or abnormal red blood cells. In the first step of bilirubin synthesis, the heme molecule is stripped from the hemoglobin molecule. Heme then passes through various processes of porphyrin catabolism, which varies according to the region of the body in which the breakdown occurs. For example, the molecules excreted in the urine differ from those in the feces. The production of biliverdin from heme is the first major step in the catabolic pathway, after which the enzyme biliverdin reductase performs the second step, producing bilirubin from biliverdin. Ultimately, bilirubin is broken down within the body, and its metabolites excreted through bile and urine; elevated levels may indicate certain diseases. It is responsible for the yellow color of healing bruises and the yellow discoloration in jaundice. The bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase is responsible for the breakdown of bilirubin in the gut. One breakdown product, urobilin, is the main component of the straw-yellow color in urine. Another breakdown product, stercobilin, causes the brown color of feces. Although bilirubin is usually found in animals rather than plants, at least one plant species, Strelitzia nicolai, is known to contain the pigment. == Structure == Bilirubin consists of an open-chain tetrapyrrole. It is formed by oxidative cleavage of a porphyrin in heme, which affords biliverdin. Biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin. After conjugation with glucuronic acid, bilirubin is water-soluble and can be excreted. Bilirubin is structurally similar to the pigment phycobilin used by certain algae to capture light energy, and to the pigment phytochrome used by plants to sense light. All of these contain an open chain of four pyrrolic rings. Like these other pigments, some of the double-bonds in bilirubin isomerize when exposed to light. This isomerization is relevant to the phototherapy of jaundiced newborns: the E,Z-isomers of bilirubin formed upon light exposure are more soluble than the unilluminated Z,Z-isomer, as the possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonding is removed. Increased solubility allows the excretion of unconjugated bilirubin in bile. Some textbooks and research articles show the incorrect geometric isomer of bilirubin. The naturally occurring isomer is the Z,Z-isomer. == Function == Bilirubin is created by the activity of biliverdin reductase on biliverdin, a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment that is also a product of heme catabolism. Bilirubin, when oxidized, reverts to become biliverdin once again. This cycle, in addition to the demonstration of the potent antioxidant activity of bilirubin, has led to the hypothesis that bilirubin's main physiologic role is as a cellular antioxidant. Consistent with this, animal studies suggest that eliminating bilirubin results in endogenous oxidative stress. Bilirubin's antioxidant activity may be particularly important in the brain, where it prevents excitotoxicity and neuronal death by scavenging superoxide during N-methyl-D-aspartic acid neurotransmission. == Metabolism == Bilirubin in plasma is mostly produced by the destruction of erythrocytes. Heme is metabolized into biliverdin (via heme oxygenase) and then into bilirubin (via biliverdin reductase) inside the macrophages. Bilirubin is then released into the plasma and transported to the liver bound by albumin, since it is insoluble in water in this state. In this state, bilirubin is called unconjugated (despite being bound by albumin). In the liver, unconjugated bilirubin is up-taken by the hepatocytes and subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid (via the enzyme uridine diphosphate–glucuronyl transferase). In this state, bilirubin is soluble in water and it is called conjugated bilirubin. Conjugated bilirubin is excreted into the bile ducts and enters the duodenum. During its transport to the colon, it is converted into urobilinogen by the bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase. Most of the urobilinogen is further reduced into stercobilinogen and is excreted through feces (air oxidizes stercobilinogen to stercobilin, which gives feces their characteristic brown color). A lesser amount of urobilinogen is re-absorbed into portal circulation and transferred to the liver. For the most part, this urobilinogen is recycled to conjugated bilirubin and this process closes the enterohepatic circle. There is also an amount of urobilinogen which is not recycled, but rather enters the systemic circulation and subsequently the kidneys, where it is excreted. Air oxidizes urobilinogen into urobilin, which gives urine its characteristic color. In parallel, a small amount of conjugated billirubin can also enter the systemic circulation and get excreted through urine. This is exaggerated in various pathological situations. == Toxicity == === Hyperbilirubinemia === Hyperbilirubinemia is a higher-than-normal level of bilirubin in the blood. Hyperbilirubinemia may refer to increased levels of conjugated, unconjugated or both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. The causes of hyperbilirubinemia can also be classified into prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic. Prehepatic causes are associated mostly with an increase of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. They include: Hemolysis or increased breakdown of red blood cells (for example hematoma resorption) Intrahepatic causes can be associated with elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin or both. They include: Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, where the newborn's liver is not able to properly process the bilirubin causing jaundice Hepatocellular disease Viral infections (hepatitis A, B, and C) Chronic alcohol use Autoimmune disorders Genetic syndromes: Gilbert's syndrome – a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism that can result in mild jaundice, found in about 5% of the population Rotor syndrome: non-itching jaundice, with rise of bilirubin in the patient's serum, mainly of the conjugated type Dubin–Johnson syndrome Crigler–Najjar syndrome Pharmaceutical drugs (especially antipsychotic, some sex hormones, and a wide range of other drugs) Sulfonamides are contraindicated in infants less than 2 months old (exception when used with pyrimethamine in treating toxoplasmosis) as they increase unconjugated bilirubin leading to kernicterus. Drugs such as protease inhibitors like Indinavir can also cause disorders of bilirubin metabolism by competitively inhibiting the UGT1A1 enzyme. Post-hepatic causes are associated with elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin. These include: Unusually large bile duct obstruction, e.g. gallstone in common bile duct (which is the most common post-hepatic cause) Biliary stricture (benign or malignant) Cholangitis Severe liver failure with cirrhosis (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis) Pancreatitis Cirrhosis may cause normal, moderately high or high levels of bilirubin, depending on exact features of the cirrhosis. To further elucidate the causes of jaundice or increased bilirubin, it is usually simpler to look at other liver function tests (especially the enzymes alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase), blood film examination (hemolysis, etc.) or evidence of infective hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, B, C, delta, E, etc.). ==== Jaundice ==== Hemoglobin acts to transport oxygen which the body receives to all body tissue via blood vessels. Over time, when red blood cells need to be replenished, the hemoglobin is broken down in the spleen; it breaks down into two parts: heme group consisting of iron and bile and protein fraction. While protein and iron are utilized to renew red blood cells, pigments that make up the red color in blood are deposited into the bile to form bilirubin. Jaundice leads to raised bilirubin levels> that in turn negatively remove elastin-rich tissues. Jaundice may be noticeable in the sclera of the eyes at levels of about 2 to 3 mg/dl (34 to 51 μmol/L), and in the skin at higher levels. Jaundice is classified, depending upon whether the bilirubin is free or conjugated to glucuronic acid, into conjugated jaundice or unconjugated jaundice. ==== Kernicterus ==== Unbound bilirubin (Bf) levels can be used to predict the risk of neurodevelopmental handicaps within infants. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a newborn can lead to accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions that may lead to hyperbilirubinemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the feces (this is largely why the feces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation. In addition, recent studies point towards high total bilirubin levels as a cause for gallstones regardless of gender or age. == Health benefits == In the absence of liver disease, high levels of total bilirubin confers various health benefits. Studies have also revealed that levels of serum bilirubin (SBR) are inversely related to risk of certain heart diseases. While the poor solubility and potential toxicity of bilirubin limit its potential medicinal applications, current research is being done on whether bilirubin encapsulated silk fibrin nanoparticles can alleviate symptoms of disorders such as acute pancreatitis. In addition to this, there have been recent discoveries linking bilirubin and its ε-polylysine-bilirubin conjugate (PLL-BR), to more efficient insulin medication. It seems that bilirubin exhibits protective properties during the islet transplantation process when drugs are delivered throughout the bloodstream. == Blood tests == Bilirubin is degraded by light. Blood collection tubes containing blood or (especially) serum to be used in bilirubin assays should be protected from illumination. For adults, blood is typically collected by needle from a vein in the arm. In newborns, blood is often collected from a heel stick, a technique that uses a small, sharp blade to cut the skin on the infant's heel and collect a few drops of blood into a small tube. Non-invasive technology is available in some health care facilities that will measure bilirubin by using an bilirubinometer which shines light onto the skin and calculates the amount of bilirubin by analysing how the light is absorbed or reflects. This device is also known as a transcutaneous bilirubin meter. Bilirubin (in blood) is found in two forms: Note: Conjugated bilirubin is often incorrectly called ""direct bilirubin"" and unconjugated bilirubin is incorrectly called ""indirect bilirubin"". Direct and indirect refer solely to how compounds are measured or detected in solution. Direct bilirubin is any form of bilirubin which is water-soluble and is available in solution to react with assay reagents; direct bilirubin is often made up largely of conjugated bilirubin, but some unconjugated bilirubin (up to 25%) can still be part of the ""direct"" bilirubin fraction. Likewise, not all conjugated bilirubin is readily available in solution for reaction or detection (for example, if it is hydrogen bonding with itself) and therefore would not be included in the direct bilirubin fraction. Total bilirubin (TBIL) measures both BU and BC. Total bilirubin assays work by using surfactants and accelerators (like caffeine) to bring all of the different bilirubin forms into solution where they can react with assay reagents. Total and direct bilirubin levels can be measured from the blood, but indirect bilirubin is calculated from the total and direct bilirubin. Indirect bilirubin is fat-soluble and direct bilirubin is water-soluble. === Total bilirubin === Total bilirubin = direct bilirubin + indirect bilirubin Elevation of both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin is more indicative of serious liver injury than is elevation in ALT alone, as postulated in Hy's law that elucidates the relation between the lab test results and drug-induced liver injury === Indirect (unconjugated) === The measurement of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is underestimated by measurement of indirect bilirubin, as unconjugated bilirubin (without/yet glucuronidation) reacts with diazosulfanilic acid to create azobilirubin which is measured as direct bilirubin. === Direct === Direct bilirubin = Conjugated bilirubin + delta bilirubin ==== Conjugated ==== In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by the enzyme glucuronyltransferase, first to bilirubin glucuronide and then to bilirubin diglucuronide, making it soluble in water: the conjugated version is the main form of bilirubin present in the ""direct"" bilirubin fraction. Much of it goes into the bile and thus out into the small intestine. Though most bile acid is reabsorbed in the terminal ileum to participate in enterohepatic circulation, conjugated bilirubin is not absorbed and instead passes into the colon. There, colonic bacteria deconjugate and metabolize the bilirubin into colorless urobilinogen, which can be oxidized to form urobilin and stercobilin. Urobilin is excreted by the kidneys to give urine its yellow color and stercobilin is excreted in the feces giving stool its characteristic brown color. A trace (~1%) of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation to be re-excreted in the bile. Conjugated bilirubin's half-life is shorter than delta bilirubin. ==== Delta bilirubin ==== Although the terms direct and indirect bilirubin are used equivalently with conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, this is not quantitatively correct, because the direct fraction includes both conjugated bilirubin and δ bilirubin. Delta bilirubin is albumin-bound conjugated bilirubin. In the other words, delta bilirubin is the kind of bilirubin covalently bound to albumin, which appears in the serum when hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin is impaired in patients with hepatobiliary disease. Furthermore, direct bilirubin tends to overestimate conjugated bilirubin levels due to unconjugated bilirubin that has reacted with diazosulfanilic acid, leading to increased azobilirubin levels (and increased direct bilirubin). δ bilirubin = total bilirubin – (unconjugated bilirubin + conjugated bilirubin) ===== Half-life ===== The half-life of delta bilirubin is equivalent to that of albumin since the former is bound to the latter, yields 2–3 weeks. A free-of-bound bilirubin has a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. === Measurement methods === Originally, the Van den Bergh reaction was used for a qualitative estimate of bilirubin. This test is performed routinely in most medical laboratories and can be measured by a variety of methods. Total bilirubin is now often measured by the 2,5-dichlorophenyldiazonium (DPD) method, and direct bilirubin is often measured by the method of Jendrassik and Grof. == Blood levels == The bilirubin level found in the body reflects the balance between production and excretion. Blood test results are advised to always be interpreted using the reference range provided by the laboratory that performed the test. The SI units are μmol/L. Typical ranges for adults are: 0–0.3 mg/dl – Direct (conjugated) bilirubin level 0.1–1.2 mg/dl – Total serum bilirubin level == Urine tests == Urine bilirubin may also be clinically significant. Bilirubin is not normally detectable in the urine of healthy people. If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a pathological process. Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble and so is not excreted in the urine. Testing urine for both bilirubin and urobilinogen can help differentiate obstructive liver disease from other causes of jaundice. As with billirubin, under normal circumstances, only a very small amount of urobilinogen is excreted in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, some of the conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing an increase in the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase of urobilinogen in the urine. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems. == History == In ancient history, Hippocrates discussed bile pigments in two of the four humours in the context of a relationship between yellow and black biles. Hippocrates visited Democritus in Abdera who was regarded as the expert in melancholy ""black bile"". Relevant documentation emerged in 1827 when M. Louis Jacques Thénard examined the biliary tract of an elephant that had died at a Paris zoo. He observed dilated bile ducts were full of yellow magma, which he isolated and found to be insoluble in water. Treating the yellow pigment with hydrochloric acid produced a strong green color. Thenard suspected the green pigment was caused by impurities derived from mucus of bile. Leopold Gmelin experimented with nitric acid in 1826 to establish the redox behavior in change from bilirubin to biliverdin, although the nomenclature did not exist at the time. The term biliverdin was coined by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1840, although he preferred ""bilifulvin"" (yellow/red) over ""bilirubin"" (red). The term ""bilirubin"" was thought to have become mainstream based on the works of Staedeler in 1864 who crystallized bilirubin from cattle gallstones. Rudolf Virchow in 1847 recognized hematoidin to be identical to bilirubin. It is not always distinguished from hematoidin, which one modern dictionary defines as synonymous with it but another defines as ""apparently chemically identical with bilirubin but with a different site of origin, formed locally in the tissues from hemoglobin, particularly under conditions of reduced oxygen tension."" The synonymous identity of bilirubin and hematoidin was confirmed in 1923 by Fischer and Steinmetz using analytical crystallography. In the 1930s, significant advances in bilirubin isolation and synthesis were described by Hans Fischer, Plieninger, and others, and pioneering work pertaining to endogenous formation of bilirubin from heme was likewise conducted in the same decade. The suffix IXα is partially based on a system developed Fischer, which means the bilin's parent compound was protoporphyrin IX cleaved at the alpha-methine bridge (see protoporphyrin IX nomenclature). Origins pertaining to the physiological activity of bilirubin were described by Ernst Stadelmann in 1891, who may have observed the biotransformation of infused hemoglobin into bilirubin possibly inspired by Ivan Tarkhanov's 1874 works. Georg Barkan suggested the source of endogenous bilirubin to be from hemoglobin in 1932. Plieninger and Fischer demonstrated an enzymatic oxidative loss of the alpha-methine bridge of heme resulting in a bis-lactam structure in 1942. It is widely accepted that Irving London was the first to demonstrate endogenous formation of bilirubin from hemoglobin in 1950, and Sjostrand demonstrated hemoglobin catabolism produces carbon monoxide between 1949 and 1952. 14C labeled protoporphyrin biotransformation to bilirubin evidence emerged in 1966 by Cecil Watson. Rudi Schmid and Tenhunen discovered heme oxygenase, the enzyme responsible, in 1968. Earlier in 1963, Nakajima described a soluble ""heme alpha-methnyl oxygeanse"" which what later determined to be a non-enzymatic pathway, such as formation of a 1,2-Dioxetane intermediate at the methine bridge resulting in carbon monoxide release and biliverdin formation. == Notable people == Claudio Tiribelli, Italian hepatologist, studies on bilirubin == See also == Babesiosis Biliary atresia Bilirubin diglucuronide Biliverdin Crigler–Najjar syndrome Gilbert's syndrome, a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism that can result in mild jaundice, found in about 5% of the population.

351	Thiamine	WIKIPEDIA	"Thiamine, also known as thiamin and vitamin B1, is a vitamin, an essential micronutrient for humans and animals. It is found in food and commercially synthesized to be a dietary supplement or medication. Phosphorylated forms of thiamine are required for some metabolic reactions, including the breakdown of glucose and amino acids. Food sources of thiamine include whole grains, legumes, and some meats and fish. Grain processing removes much of the vitamin content, so in many countries cereals and flours are enriched with thiamine. Supplements and medications are available to treat and prevent thiamine deficiency and the disorders that result from it such as beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy. They are also used to treat maple syrup urine disease and Leigh syndrome. Supplements and medications are typically taken by mouth, but may also be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection. Thiamine supplements are generally well tolerated. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur when repeated doses are given by injection. Thiamine is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication, and in some countries as a non-prescription dietary supplement. In 2022, it was the 288th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions. == Definition == Thiamine is one of the B vitamins and is also known as vitamin B1. It is a cation that is usually supplied as a chloride salt. It is soluble in water, methanol and glycerol, but practically insoluble in less polar organic solvents. In the body, thiamine can form derivatives; the most well-characterized of which is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids. The chemical structure consists of an aminopyrimidine and a thiazolium ring linked by a methylene bridge. The thiazole is substituted with methyl and hydroxyethyl side chains. Thiamine is stable at acidic pH, but it is unstable in alkaline solutions and from exposure to heat. It reacts strongly in Maillard-type reactions. Oxidation yields the fluorescent derivative thiochrome, which can be used to determine the amount of the vitamin present in biological samples. == Deficiency == Well-known disorders caused by thiamine deficiency include beriberi, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, optic neuropathy, Leigh's disease, African seasonal ataxia (or Nigerian seasonal ataxia), and central pontine myelinolysis. Symptoms include malaise, weight loss, irritability and confusion. In Western countries, chronic alcoholism is a risk factor for deficiency. Also at risk are older adults, persons with HIV/AIDS or diabetes, and those who have had bariatric surgery. Varying degrees of thiamine insufficiency have been associated with the long-term use of diuretics. == Biological functions == Five natural thiamine phosphate derivatives are known: thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), adenosine thiamine diphosphate (AThDP) and adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP). They are involved in many cellular processes. The best-characterized form is TPP, a coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids. While its role is well-known, the non-coenzyme action of thiamine and derivatives may be realized through binding to proteins which do not use that mechanism. No physiological role is known for the monophosphate except as an intermediate in cellular conversion of thiamine to the di- and triphosphates. === Thiamine pyrophosphate === Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), also called thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), participates as a coenzyme in metabolic reactions, including those in which polarity inversion takes place. Its synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme thiamine diphosphokinase according to the reaction thiamine + ATP → TPP + AMP (EC 2.7.6.2). TPP is a coenzyme for several enzymes that catalyze the transfer of two-carbon units and in particular the dehydrogenation (decarboxylation and subsequent conjugation with coenzyme A) of 2-oxoacids (alpha-keto acids). The mechanism of action of TPP as a coenzyme relies on its ability to form an ylide. Examples include: Present in most species pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (also called α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase transketolase Present in some species: pyruvate decarboxylase (in yeast) several additional bacterial enzymes The enzymes transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) are important in carbohydrate metabolism. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. OGDH catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) to succinyl-CoA and CO2 during the citric acid cycle. The reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the citric acid cycle. The cytosolic enzyme transketolase is central to the pentose phosphate pathway, a major route for the biosynthesis of the pentose sugars deoxyribose and ribose. The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main energy transfer molecule for the cell. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the synthesis of myelin and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. === Thiamine triphosphate === ThTP is implicated in chloride channel activation in the neurons of mammals and other animals, although its role is not well understood. ThTP has been found in bacteria, fungi and plants, suggesting that it has other cellular roles. In Escherichia coli, it is implicated in the response to amino acid starvation. === Adenosine derivatives === AThDP exists in small amounts in vertebrate liver, but its role remains unknown. AThTP is present in E. coli, where it accumulates as a result of carbon starvation. In this bacterium, AThTP may account for up to 20% of total thiamine. It also exists in lesser amounts in yeast, roots of higher plants and animal tissue. == Medical uses == During pregnancy, thiamine is sent to the fetus via the placenta. Pregnant women have a greater requirement for the vitamin than other adults, especially during the third trimester. Pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum are at an increased risk of thiamine deficiency due to losses when vomiting. In lactating women, thiamine is delivered in breast milk even if it results in thiamine deficiency in the mother. Thiamine is important not only for mitochondrial membrane development, but also for synaptic membrane function. It has also been suggested that a deficiency hinders brain development in infants and may be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome. == Dietary recommendations == The US National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for thiamine in 1998. The EARs for thiamine for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9 mg/day and 1.1 mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.2 mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy and for lactating females is 1.4 mg/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.2–0.3 mg/day and for children aged 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/day. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intakes (PRIs) instead of RDAs, and Average Requirements instead of EARs. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children the PRI is 0.1 mg thiamine per megajoule (MJ) of energy in their diet. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 239 kcal, an adult consuming 2390 kilocalories ought to be consuming 1.0 mg thiamine. This is slightly lower than the US RDA. Neither the National Academy of Medicine nor EFSA have set an upper intake level for thiamine, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. === Safety === Thiamine is generally well tolerated and non-toxic when administered orally. There are rare reports of adverse side effects when thiamine is given intravenously, including allergic reactions, nausea, lethargy, and impaired coordination. === Labeling === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value. Since 27 May 2016, the Daily Value has been 1.2 mg, in line with the RDA. == Sources == Thiamine is found in a wide variety of processed and whole foods, including lentils, peas, whole grains, pork, and nuts. A typical daily prenatal vitamin product contains around 1.5 mg of thiamine. === Food fortification === Some countries require or recommend fortification of grain foods such as wheat, rice or maize (corn) because processing lowers vitamin content. As of February 2022, 59 countries, mostly in North and Sub-Saharan Africa, require food fortification of wheat, rice or maize with thiamine or thiamine mononitrate. The amounts stipulated range from 2.0 to 10.0 mg/kg. An additional 18 countries have a voluntary fortification program. For example, the Indian government recommends 3.5 mg/kg for ""maida"" (white) and ""atta"" (whole wheat) flour. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Thiamine biosynthesis occurs in bacteria, some protozoans, plants, and fungi. The thiazole and pyrimidine moieties are biosynthesized separately and are then combined to form ThMP by the action of thiamine-phosphate synthase. The pyrimidine ring system is formed in a reaction catalysed by phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase (ThiC), an enzyme in the radical SAM superfamily of iron–sulfur proteins, which use S-adenosyl methionine as a cofactor. The starting material is 5-aminoimidazole ribotide, which undergoes a rearrangement reaction via radical intermediates which incorporate the blue, green and red fragments shown into the product. The thiazole ring is formed in a reaction catalysed by thiazole synthase (EC 2.8.1.10). The ultimate precursors are 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, 2-iminoacetate and a sulfur carrier protein called ThiS. An additional protein, ThiG, is also required to bring together all the components of the ring at the enzyme active site. The final step to form ThMP involves decarboxylation of the thiazole intermediate, which reacts with the pyrophosphate derivative of phosphomethylpyrimidine, itself a product of a kinase, phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase. The biosynthetic pathways differ among organisms. In E. coli and other enterobacteriaceae, ThMP is phosphorylated to the cofactor TPP by a thiamine-phosphate kinase (ThMP + ATP → TPP + ADP). In most bacteria and in eukaryotes, ThMP is hydrolyzed to thiamine and then pyrophosphorylated to TPP by thiamine diphosphokinase (thiamine + ATP → TPP + AMP). The biosynthetic pathways are regulated by riboswitches. If there is sufficient thiamine present in the cell then the thiamine binds to the mRNAs for the enzymes that are required in the pathway and prevents their translation. If there is no thiamine present then there is no inhibition, and the enzymes required for the biosynthesis are produced. The specific riboswitch, the TPP riboswitch, is the only known riboswitch found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. === Laboratory synthesis === In the first total synthesis in 1936, ethyl 3-ethoxypropanoate was treated with ethyl formate to give an intermediate dicarbonyl compound which when reacted with acetamidine formed a substituted pyrimidine. Conversion of its hydroxyl group to an amino group was carried out by nucleophilic aromatic substitution, first to the chloride derivative using phosphorus oxychloride, followed by treatment with ammonia. The ethoxy group was then converted to a bromo derivative using hydrobromic acid. In the final stage, thiamine (as its dibromide salt) was formed in an alkylation reaction using 4-methyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiazole.: 7 === Industrial synthesis === Merck & Co. adapted the 1936 laboratory-scale synthesis, allowing them to manufacture thiamine in Rahway in 1937. However, an alternative route using the intermediate Grewe diamine (5-(aminomethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinamine), first published in 1937, was investigated by Hoffman La Roche and competitive manufacturing processes followed. Efficient routes to the diamine have continued to be of interest. In the European Economic Area, thiamine is registered under REACH regulation and between 100 and 1,000 tonnes per annum are manufactured or imported there. === Synthetic analogues === Many vitamin B1 analogues, such as Benfotiamine, fursultiamine, and sulbutiamine, are synthetic derivatives of thiamine. Most were developed in Japan in the 1950s and 1960s as forms that were intended to improve absorption compared to thiamine. Some are approved for use in some countries as a drug or non-prescription dietary supplement for treatment of diabetic neuropathy or other health conditions. == Absorption, metabolism and excretion == In the upper small intestine, thiamine phosphate esters present in food are hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase enzymes. At low concentrations (<2 μmol l−1), the absorption process is carrier-mediated. At higher concentrations, absorption also occurs via passive diffusion. Active transport can be inhibited by alcohol consumption or by folate deficiency. The majority of thiamine in serum is circulating bound to albumin, with over (90%) in erythrocytes (red blood cells), and is delivered to cells with high metabolic needs—particularly those in the brain, liver, pancreas, heart, and skeletal and smooth muscles, including cardiac muscle cells. A specific binding protein called thiamine-binding protein has been identified in rat serum and is believed to be a hormone-regulated carrier protein important for tissue distribution of thiamine. Uptake of thiamine by cells of the blood and other tissues occurs via active transport and passive diffusion. Two members of the family of transporter proteins encoded by the genes SLC19A2 and SLC19A3 are capable of thiamine transport. In some tissues, thiamine uptake and secretion appear to be mediated by a Na+-dependent transporter and a transcellular proton gradient. Human storage of thiamine is about 25 to 50 mg, with the greatest concentrations in liver, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and kidneys. ThMP and free (unphosphorylated) thiamine are present in plasma, milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and, it is presumed, all extracellular fluid. Unlike the highly phosphorylated forms of thiamine, ThMP and free thiamine are capable of crossing cell membranes. Calcium and magnesium have been shown to affect the distribution of thiamine in the body and magnesium deficiency has been shown to aggravate thiamine deficiency. Thiamine contents in human tissues are less than those of other species. The half-life of thiamine content stored in tissues of human body is about 9-18 days. After intake in high doses, the plasma half-life of thiamine can be as short as 1.5-12 hours. Thiamine and its metabolites (2-methyl-4-amino-5-pyrimidine carboxylic acid, 4-methyl-thiazole-5-acetic acid, and others) are excreted principally in the urine. === Interference === The bioavailability of thiamine in foods can be interfered with in a variety of ways. Sulfites, added to foods as a preservative, will attack thiamine at the methylene bridge, cleaving the pyrimidine ring from the thiazole ring. The rate of this reaction is increased under acidic conditions. Thiamine is degraded by thermolabile thiaminases present in some species of fish, shellfish and other foods. The pupae of an African silk worm, Anaphe venata, is a traditional food in Nigeria. Consumption leads to thiamine deficiency. Older literature reported that in Thailand, consumption of fermented, uncooked fish caused thiamine deficiency, but either abstaining from eating the fish or heating it first reversed the deficiency. In ruminants, intestinal bacteria synthesize thiamine and thiaminases. The bacterial thiaminases are cell surface enzymes that must dissociate from the cell membrane before being activated; the dissociation can occur in ruminants under acidotic conditions. In dairy cows, over-feeding with grain causes subacute ruminal acidosis and increased ruminal bacteria thiaminase release, resulting in thiamine deficiency. From reports on two small studies conducted in Thailand, chewing slices of areca nut wrapped in betel leaves and chewing tea leaves reduced food thiamine bioavailability by a mechanism that may involve tannins. Bariatric surgery for weight loss is known to interfere with vitamin absorption. A meta-analysis reported that 27% of people who underwent bariatric surgeries experience vitamin B1 deficiency. == History == Thiamine was the first of the water-soluble vitamins to be isolated. The earliest observations in humans and in chickens had shown that diets of primarily polished white rice caused beriberi, but did not attribute it to the absence of a previously unknown essential nutrient. In 1884, Takaki Kanehiro, a surgeon general in the Imperial Japanese Navy, rejected the previous germ theory for beriberi and suggested instead that the disease was due to insufficiencies in the diet. Switching diets on a navy ship, he discovered that replacing a diet of white rice only with one also containing barley, meat, milk, bread, and vegetables, nearly eliminated beriberi on a nine-month sea voyage. However, Takaki had added many foods to the successful diet and he incorrectly attributed the benefit to increased protein intake, as vitamins were unknown at the time. The Navy was not convinced of the need for such an expensive program of dietary improvement, and many men continued to die of beriberi, even during the Russo-Japanese war of 1904–5. Not until 1905, after the anti-beriberi factor had been discovered in rice bran (removed by polishing into white rice) and in barley bran, was Takaki's experiment rewarded. He was made a baron in the Japanese peerage system, after which he was affectionately called ""Barley Baron"". The specific connection to grain was made in 1897 by Christiaan Eijkman, a military doctor in the Dutch East Indies, who discovered that fowl fed on a diet of cooked, polished rice developed paralysis that could be reversed by discontinuing rice polishing. He attributed beriberi to the high levels of starch in rice being toxic. He believed that the toxicity was countered in a compound present in the rice polishings. An associate, Gerrit Grijns, correctly interpreted the connection between excessive consumption of polished rice and beriberi in 1901: He concluded that rice contains an essential nutrient in the outer layers of the grain that is removed by polishing. Eijkman was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1929, because his observations led to the discovery of vitamins. In 1910, a Japanese agricultural chemist of Tokyo Imperial University, Umetaro Suzuki, isolated a water-soluble thiamine compound from rice bran, which he named aberic acid. (He later renamed it Orizanin.) He described the compound as not only an anti-beriberi factor, but also as being essential to human nutrition; however, this finding failed to gain publicity outside of Japan, because a claim that the compound was a new finding was omitted in translation of his publication from Japanese to German. In 1911 a Polish biochemist Casimir Funk isolated the antineuritic substance from rice bran (the modern thiamine) that he called a ""vitamine"" (on account of its containing an amino group). However, Funk did not completely characterize its chemical structure. Dutch chemists, Barend Coenraad Petrus Jansen and his closest collaborator Willem Frederik Donath, went on to isolate and crystallize the active agent in 1926, whose structure was determined by Robert Runnels Williams, in 1934. Thiamine was named by the Williams team as a portmanteau of ""thio"" (meaning sulfur-containing) and ""vitamin"". The term ""vitamin"" coming indirectly, by way of Funk, from the amine group of thiamine itself (although by this time, vitamins were known to not always be amines, for example, vitamin C). Thiamine was also synthesized by the Williams group in 1936. Sir Rudolph Peters, in Oxford, used pigeons to understand how thiamine deficiency results in the pathological-physiological symptoms of beriberi. Pigeons fed exclusively on polished rice developed opisthotonos, a condition characterized by head retraction. If not treated, the animals died after a few days. Administration of thiamine after opisthotonos was observed led to a complete cure within 30 minutes. As no morphological modifications were seen in the brain of the pigeons before and after treatment with thiamine, Peters introduced the concept of a biochemical-induced injury. In 1937, Lohmann and Schuster showed that the diphosphorylated thiamine derivative, TPP, was a cofactor required for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. Some contributors to the discovery of thiamine == References =="	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.0009761215, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' FOOD': -5.9153886e-06}
352	Nifedipine	WIKIPEDIA	Nifedipine, sold under the brand name Procardia among others, is a calcium channel blocker medication used to manage angina, high blood pressure, Raynaud's phenomenon, and premature labor. It is one of the treatments of choice for Prinzmetal angina. It may be used to treat severe high blood pressure in pregnancy. Its use in preterm labor may allow more time for steroids to improve the baby's lung function and provide time for transfer of the mother to a well qualified medical facility before delivery. It is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine type. Nifedipine is taken by mouth and comes in fast- and slow-release formulations. Common side effects include lightheadedness, headache, feeling tired, leg swelling, cough, and shortness of breath. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure and heart failure. Nifedipine is considered safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Nifedipine was patented in 1967, and approved for use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 151st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === High blood pressure === The approved uses are for the long-term treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. In hypertension, recent clinical guidelines generally favour diuretics and ACE inhibitors, although calcium channel antagonists, along with thiazide diuretics, are still favoured as primary treatment for patients over 55 and black patients. Nifedipine given as sublingual administration has previously been used in hypertensive emergencies. It was once frequently prescribed on an as-needed basis to patients taking MAOIs for real or perceived hypertensive crises. This was found to be dangerous, and has been abandoned. Sublingual administration of nifedipine promotes a hypotensive effect via peripheral vasodilation. It can cause an uncontrollable decrease in blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, and a steal phenomenon in certain vascular beds. There have been multiple reports in the medical literature of serious adverse effects with sublingual nifedipine, including cerebral ischemia/infarction, myocardial infarction, complete heart block, and death. As a result of this, in 1985 the FDA reviewed all data regarding the safety and effectiveness of sublingual nifedipine for the management of hypertensive emergencies, and concluded that the practice should be abandoned because it was neither safe nor effective. An exception to the avoidance of this practice is in the use of nifedipine for the treatment of hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury. === Early labor === Nifedipine has been used frequently as a tocolytic (agent that delays premature labor). A Cochrane review has concluded that it has benefits over placebo or no treatment for prolongation of pregnancy. It also has benefits over beta-agonists and may also have some benefits over atosiban and magnesium sulfate, although atosiban results in fewer maternal adverse effects. No difference was found in the rate of deaths among babies around the time of birth, while data on longer-term outcomes is lacking. === Other === Raynaud's phenomenon is often treated with nifedipine. A 2005 meta-analysis showed modest benefits (33% decrease in attack severity, 2.8-5 reduction in absolute number of attacks per week); it does conclude that most included studies used low doses of nifedipine. Topical nifedipine has been shown to be as effective as topical nitrates for anal fissures. Nifedipine is also used in high-altitude medicine to treat high altitude pulmonary edema. Nifedipine is one of the main choices for the treatment of Prinzmetal angina due to its vasodilating effects on the coronary arteries. Other uses include painful spasms of the esophagus such as from cancer or tetanus. It is also used for the small subset of people with pulmonary hypertension. Finally, nifedipine can be used in the treatment of renal calculi, which are commonly referred to as kidney stones. Studies have indicated that it helps to relieve renal colic. However, alpha blockers (such as tamsulosin) have been described as being significantly better. == Side effects == Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and patients are commonly warned they may feel dizzy or faint after taking the first few doses. Tachycardia (fast heart rate) may occur as a reaction. These problems are much less frequent in the sustained-release preparations of nifedipine. Extended release formulations of nifedipine should be taken on an empty stomach, and patients are warned not to consume anything containing grapefruit or grapefruit juice, as they raise blood nifedipine levels. There are several possible mechanisms, including the inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. As calcium channel blocker, nifedipine has a risk of causing gingival hyperplasia. == Overdose == A number of persons have developed toxicity due to acute overdosage with nifedipine, either accidentally or intentionally, and via either oral or parenteral administration. The adverse effects include lethargy, bradycardia, marked hypotension and loss of consciousness. The drug may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or to assist in a medicolegal investigation following death. Analytical methods usually involve gas or liquid chromatography and specimen concentrations are usually in the 100-1000 μg/L range. == Mechanism of action == Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker. Although nifedipine and other dihydropyridines are commonly regarded as specific to the L-type calcium channel, they also possess nonspecific activity towards other voltage-dependent calcium channels. Nifedipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid. == History == Nifedipine (initially BAY a1040, then Adalat) was developed by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer, with most initial studies being performed in the early 1970s. In 1980, Ahmed Hegazy and Klaus-Dieter Rämsch submitted their invention on extended release formulation that became known as Adalat retard. Marketed as Adalat CC in US, a 1995 US lawsuit found that Pfizer's Procardia XL was also based on Bayer's Adalat European and US patents. The use of nifedipine and related calcium channel antagonists was much reduced in response to 1995 trials that mortality was increased in patients with coronary artery disease who took nifedipine. This study was a meta-analysis, and demonstrated harm mainly in short-acting forms of nifedipine (that could cause large fluctuations in blood pressure) and at high doses of 80 mg a day and more. == Society and culture == === Brand names === In India, nifedipine is manufactured by JB Chemicals, and comes in brands Nicardia Retard (Nifedipine 10 mg, 20 mg tablets) and Nicardia XL 30/60, which are Nifedipine Extended Release tablets. In Switzerland, nifedipine is sold only as a generic version of extended release formulation, under the names Nifedipin Mepha and Nifedipin Spirig. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
355	Amoxicillin	WIKIPEDIA	"Amoxicillin is an antibiotic medication belonging to the aminopenicillin class of the penicillin family. The drug is used to treat bacterial infections such as middle ear infection, strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, odontogenic infections, and urinary tract infections. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth), or less commonly by either intramuscular injection or by an IV bolus injection, which is a relatively quick intravenous injection lasting from a couple of seconds to a few minutes. Common adverse effects include nausea and rash. It may also increase the risk of yeast infections and, when used in combination with clavulanic acid, diarrhea. It should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin. While usable in those with kidney problems, the dose may need to be decreased. Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding does not appear to be harmful. Amoxicillin is in the β-lactam family of antibiotics. Amoxicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into medical use in 1972. Amoxil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1974, and in the United Kingdom in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in children. Amoxicillin is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 26th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 20 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amoxicillin is used in the treatment of a number of infections, including acute otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, skin infections, urinary tract infections, Salmonella infections, Lyme disease, and chlamydia infections. === Acute otitis media === Children with acute otitis media who are younger than six months of age are generally treated with amoxicillin or other antibiotics. Although most children with acute otitis media who are older than two years old do not benefit from treatment with amoxicillin or other antibiotics, such treatment may be helpful in children younger than two years old with acute otitis media that is bilateral or accompanied by ear drainage. In the past, amoxicillin was dosed three times daily when used to treat acute otitis media, which resulted in missed doses in routine ambulatory practice. There is now evidence that two-times daily dosing or once-daily dosing has similar effectiveness. === Respiratory infections === Most sinusitis infections are caused by viruses, for which amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are ineffective, and the small benefit gained by amoxicillin may be overridden by the adverse effects. Amoxicillin is considered the first-line empirical treatment for most cases of uncomplicated bacterial sinusitis in children and adults when culture data is unavailable. Amoxicillin is recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in adults by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, either alone (mild to moderate severity disease) or in combination with a macrolide. Research suggests that is as effective as co-amoxiclav (a broad-spectrum antibiotic) for people admitted to hospital with pneumonia, regardless of its severity. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment for pneumonia that is not ""severe"". Amoxicillin is used in post-exposure inhalation of anthrax to prevent disease progression and for prophylaxis. === H. pylori === It is effective as one part of a multi-drug regimen for the treatment of stomach infections of Helicobacter pylori. It is typically combined with a proton-pump inhibitor (such as omeprazole) and a macrolide antibiotic (such as clarithromycin); other drug combinations are also effective. === Lyme borreliosis === Amoxicillin is effective for the treatment of early cutaneous Lyme borreliosis; the effectiveness and safety of oral amoxicillin is neither better nor worse than common alternatively-used antibiotics. === Odontogenic infections === Amoxicillin is used to treat odontogenic infections, infections of the tongue, lips, and other oral tissues. It may be prescribed following a tooth extraction, particularly in those with compromised immune systems. === Skin infections === Amoxicillin is occasionally used for the treatment of skin infections, such as acne vulgaris. It is often an effective treatment for cases of acne vulgaris that have responded poorly to other antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline. === Infections in infants in resource-limited settings === Amoxicillin is recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child. Amoxicillin in combination with gentamicin is recommended for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option. === Prevention of bacterial endocarditis === It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis and as a pain-reliever in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent Streptococcus pneumoniae and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax. The United Kingdom recommends against its use for infectious endocarditis prophylaxis. These recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious endocarditis. === Combination treatment === Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin. For this reason, it may be combined with clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor. This drug combination is commonly called co-amoxiclav. === Spectrum of activity === It is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, β-lactam antibiotic in the aminopenicillin family used to treat susceptible Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics. In general, Streptococcus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, Haemophilus, Helicobacter, and Moraxella are susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are resistant to it. Some E. coli and most clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus have developed resistance to amoxicillin to varying degrees. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are similar to those for other β-lactam antibiotics, including nausea, vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated colitis. Diarrhea (loose bowel movements) may also occur. Rarer adverse effects include mental and behavioral changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, hyperactivity, agitation, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these adverse effects. Similarly to other penicillins, amoxicillin has been associated with an increased risk of seizures. Amoxicillin-induced neurotoxicity has been especially associated with concentrations of greater than 110 mg/L. The onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense; emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible. The initial phase of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state, skin rash with intense itching (often beginning in the fingertips and around the groin area and rapidly spreading), and sensations of fever, nausea, and vomiting. Any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously. However, more mild allergy symptoms, such as a rash, can occur at any time during treatment, even up to a week after treatment has ceased. For some people allergic to amoxicillin, the adverse effects can be fatal due to anaphylaxis. Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused a drug-induced immunoallergic-type hepatitis in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested lethargy, vomiting, and renal dysfunction. There is poor reporting of adverse effects of amoxicillin from clinical trials. For this reason, the severity and frequency of adverse effects from amoxicillin are probably higher than reported in clinical trials. === Nonallergic rash === Between 3 and 10% of children taking amoxicillin (or ampicillin) show a late-developing (>72 hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously) rash, which is sometimes referred to as the ""amoxicillin rash"". The rash can also occur in adults and may rarely be a component of the DRESS syndrome. The rash is described as maculopapular or morbilliform (measles-like; therefore, in medical literature, it is called ""amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash"".). It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two. A nonallergic amoxicillin rash may also be an indicator of infectious mononucleosis. Some studies indicate about 80–90% of patients with acute Epstein–Barr virus infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash. == Interactions == Amoxicillin may interact with these drugs: Anticoagulants (dabigatran, warfarin). Methotrexate (chemotherapy and immunosuppressant). Typhoid, Cholera and BCG vaccines. Probenecid reduces renal excretion and increases blood levels of amoxicillin. Oral contraceptives potentially become less effective. Allopurinol (gout treatment). Mycophenolate (immunosuppressant) When given intravenously or intramuscularly: It should not be mixed with blood products, or proteinaceous fluids (including protein hydrolysates) or with intravenous lipid emulsions aminoglycoside should be injected at a separate site from amoxicillin if the patient is prescribed both medications at the same time. Neither drug should be mixed in a syringe. Neither should they be mixed in an intravenous fluid container or giving set because of loss of activity of the aminoglycoside under these conditions. ciprofloxacin should not be mixed with amoxicillin. Infusions containing dextran or bicarbonate should not be mixed with amoxicillin solutions. == Pharmacology == Amoxicillin (α-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin) is a semisynthetic derivative of penicillin with a structure similar to ampicillin but with better absorption when taken by mouth, thus yielding higher concentrations in blood and in urine. Amoxicillin diffuses easily into tissues and body fluids. It will cross the placenta and is excreted into breastmilk in small quantities. It is metabolized by the liver and excreted into the urine. It has an onset of 30 minutes and a half-life of 3.7 hours in newborns and 1.4 hours in adults. Amoxicillin attaches to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. It is effective against streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Helicobacter pylori. As a derivative of ampicillin, amoxicillin is a member of the penicillin family and, like penicillins, is a β-lactam antibiotic. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the bacterial cell wall. It has two ionizable groups in the physiological range (the amino group in alpha-position to the amide carbonyl group and the carboxyl group). == Chemistry == Amoxicillin is a β-lactam and aminopenicillin antibiotic in terms of chemical structure. It is structurally related to ampicillin. The experimental log P of amoxicillin is 0.87. It is described as an ""ambiphilic""—between hydrophilic and lipophilic—antibiotic. == History == Amoxicillin was one of several semisynthetic derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) developed by the Beecham Group in the 1960s. It was invented by Anthony Alfred Walter Long and John Herbert Charles Nayler, two British scientists. It became available in 1972 and was the second aminopenicillin to reach the market (after ampicillin in 1961). Co-amoxiclav became available in 1981. == Society and culture == === Economics === Amoxicillin is relatively inexpensive. In 2022, a survey of eight generic antibiotics commonly prescribed in the United States found their average cost to be about $42.67, while amoxicillin was sold for $12.14 on average. === Modes of delivery === Pharmaceutical manufacturers make amoxicillin in trihydrate form, for oral use available as capsules, regular, chewable and dispersible tablets, syrup and pediatric suspension for oral use, and as the sodium salt for intravenous administration. An extended-release is available. The intravenous form of amoxicillin is not sold in the United States. When an intravenous aminopenicillin is required in the United States, ampicillin is typically used. When there is an adequate response to ampicillin, the course of antibiotic therapy may often be completed with oral amoxicillin. Research with mice indicated successful delivery using intraperitoneally injected amoxicillin-bearing microparticles. === Names === Amoxicillin is the international nonproprietary name (INN), British Approved Name (BAN), and United States Adopted Name (USAN), while amoxycillin is the Australian Approved Name (AAN). Amoxicillin is one of the semisynthetic penicillins discovered by the former pharmaceutical company Beecham Group. The patent for amoxicillin has expired, thus amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav preparations are marketed under various brand names across the world. == Veterinary uses == Amoxicillin is also sometimes used as an antibiotic for animals. The use of amoxicillin for animals intended for human consumption (chickens, cattle, and swine for example) has been approved. == References == == Further reading == Neal MJ (2002).

357	Tamoxifen	WIKIPEDIA	"Tamoxifen, sold under the brand name Nolvadex among others, is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to prevent breast cancer in women and men. It is also being studied for other types of cancer. It has been used for Albright syndrome. Tamoxifen is typically taken daily by mouth for five years for breast cancer. Serious side effects include a small increased risk of uterine cancer, stroke, vision problems, and pulmonary embolism. Common side effects include irregular periods, weight loss, and hot flashes. It may cause harm to the baby if taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) and works by decreasing the growth of breast cancer cells. It is a member of the triphenylethylene group of compounds. Tamoxifen was initially made in 1962, by chemist Dora Richardson. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tamoxifen is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 317th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900 thousand prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Dysmenorrhea === Dysmenorrhea is the term for menstrual pain, usually centered in the lower abdomen but often spreading to the back and inner thighs. It is a common gynecological condition that can seriously affect daily activities and well-being. Tamoxifen has been identified and used to effectively improve blood flow, reduce uterine contractility and pain in dysmenorrhea patients. === Breast cancer === Tamoxifen is used for the treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive or ER+) breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer; using tamoxifen with an intrauterine system releasing levonorgestrel might increase vaginal bleeding after 1 to 2 years, but reduces somewhat endometrial polyps and hyperplasia, but not necessarily endometrial cancer. Additionally, it is the most common hormone treatment for male breast cancer. It is also approved by the FDA for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. The effectiveness of tamoxifen is primarily influenced by estrogen receptor (ER) status, which was the key predictor of the proportional benefits observed. It has been further approved for the reduction of contralateral (in the opposite breast) cancer. Five years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment significantly lowers the 15-year risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality. The overall use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years. In 2006, the large STAR clinical study concluded that raloxifene is also effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer. Updated results after an average of 6.75 years of follow up found that raloxifene retains 76% of tamoxifen's effectiveness in preventing invasive breast cancer, with 45% fewer uterine cancers and 25% fewer blood clots in women taking raloxifene than in women taking tamoxifen. === Infertility === Tamoxifen is used for ovulation induction to treat infertility in women with anovulatory disorders. It is given at days three to seven of a woman's cycle. Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) via ER antagonism and thereby increasing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and increasing testicular testosterone production. Some animal studies have suggested tamoxifen could have negative effects on sperm quality and prostatic and gonadal health. === Gynecomastia === Benign enlargement of the male breast, whether asymptomatic or painful, is a common condition thought to result from an increased estrogen/testosterone ratio or from heightened estrogenic or reduced androgenic activity via receptor interactions.Tamoxifen is used to prevent and treat gynecomastia. It is taken as a preventative measure in small doses, or used at the onset of any symptoms such as nipple soreness or sensitivity. Current treatments typically involve pain relief through medication or surgery. However, targeting the underlying estrogenic stimulation may offer a more specific therapeutic approach. In a double-blind crossover study, patients were given either a placebo or tamoxifen (10 mg orally twice daily) for one month, in random order. Seven out of ten patients saw a reduction in gynecomastia size with tamoxifen (P < 0.005), and the overall reduction for the group was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No benefits were observed with the placebo (P > 0.1). Additionally, all four patients with painful gynecomastia experienced relief of their symptoms, and no toxicity was noted. Although the breast size reduction was partial, this suggests that longer treatment may be necessary. Follow-up examinations conducted 9 to 12 months after treatment revealed no significant changes, except in two cases: one tamoxifen responder had a recurrence of breast tenderness after six months, and one non-responder developed increased breast size and new tenderness after ten months. Other medications are taken for similar purposes such as clomifene and aromatase inhibitor drugs; which are used in order to try to avoid the hormone-related adverse effects. Overall, tamoxifen appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for selected cases of gynecomastia. === Early puberty === Tamoxifen is useful in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty, for instance due to McCune–Albright syndrome, in both girls and boys. It has been found to decrease growth velocity and the rate of bone maturation in girls with precocious puberty, and hence to improve final height in these individuals. === Available forms === Tamoxifen is available as a tablet or oral solution. == Contraindications == Tamoxifen has a number of contraindications, including known hypersensitivity to tamoxifen or other ingredients, individuals taking concomitant coumarin-type anticoagulant therapy, and women with a history of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). == Side effects == A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. === Endometrial cancer === Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Even though it is an antagonist in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the endometrium and has been linked to endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects. With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for five years. The American Cancer Society lists tamoxifen as a known carcinogen, stating that it increases the risk of some types of uterine cancer while lowering the risk of breast cancer recurrence. === Cardiovascular and metabolic === Tamoxifen treatment of postmenopausal women is associated with beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. For some women, tamoxifen can cause a rapid increase in triglyceride concentration in the blood. In addition, there is an increased risk of thromboembolism especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility. Use of tamoxifen has been shown to slightly increase risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. === Liver toxicity === Tamoxifen has been associated with a number of cases of hepatotoxicity. Several different varieties of hepatotoxicity have been reported. Tamoxifen can also precipitate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese and overweight women (not in normal weight women) at an average rate of 40% after a year use with 20 mg/day. == Overdose == Acute overdose of tamoxifen has not been reported in humans. In dose-ranging studies, tamoxifen was administered at very high doses in women (e.g., 300 mg/m2) and was found to produce acute neurotoxicity including tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, and dizziness. These symptoms occurred within three to five days of therapy and disappeared within two to five days of discontinuation of therapy. No indications of permanent neurotoxicity were observed. QT prolongation was also observed with very high doses of tamoxifen. There is no specific antidote for overdose of tamoxifen. Instead, treatment should be based on symptoms. == Interactions == Patients with variant forms of the gene CYP2D6 may not receive full benefit from tamoxifen because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites. On 18 October 2006, the Subcommittee for Clinical Pharmacology recommended relabeling tamoxifen to include information about this gene in the package insert. Certain CYP2D6 variations in breast cancer patients lead to a worse clinical outcome for tamoxifen treatment. Genotyping therefore has the potential for identification of women who have these CYP2D6 phenotypes and for whom the use of tamoxifen is associated with poor outcomes. Recent research has shown that 7–10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full medical benefit from taking tamoxifen due to their genetic make-up. DNA Drug Safety Testing can examine DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications. Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients likely to benefit from tamoxifen. Recent studies suggest that taking the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) can decrease the effectiveness of tamoxifen, as these drugs compete for the CYP2D6 enzyme which is needed to metabolize tamoxifen into its active forms. A U.S. study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in 2009 found that after two years, 7.5% of women who took only tamoxifen had a recurrence, compared with 16% who took either paroxetine, fluoxetine or sertraline, drugs considered to be the most potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. That difference translates to a 120% increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Patients taking the SSRIs Celexa (citalopram), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Luvox (fluvoxamine) did not have an increased risk of recurrence, due to their lack of competitive metabolism for the CYP2D6 enzyme. A newer study demonstrated a clearer and stronger effect from paroxetine in causing the worst outcomes. Patients treated with both paroxetine and tamoxifen have a 67% increased risk of death from breast cancer, from 24% to 91%, depending on the duration of coadministration. Tamoxifen interacts with certain other antiestrogens. The aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide induces the metabolism of tamoxifen. Conversely, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole does not affect the metabolism of tamoxifen. However, tamoxifen induces the metabolism of letrozole and significantly reduces its concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Selective estrogen receptor modulator activity ==== Tamoxifen acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or as a partial agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It has mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, with its profile of effects differing by tissue. For instance, tamoxifen has predominantly antiestrogenic effects in the breasts but predominantly estrogenic effects in the uterus and liver. In breast tissue, tamoxifen acts as an ER antagonist so that transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is inhibited. A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER agonist (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting osteoclasts, it prevents osteoporosis. When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, it was thought that tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissues, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very surprising that the opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen's tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs. Tamoxifen is a long-acting SERM, with a nuclear retention of the ER–tamoxifen (or metabolite) complex of greater than 48 hours. It has relatively little affinity for the ERs itself and instead acts as a prodrug of active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen; 4-OHT). These metabolites have approximately 30 to 100 times greater affinity for the ERs than tamoxifen itself. Per one study, tamoxifen had 7% and 6% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, whereas afimoxifene had 178% and 338% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Hence, afimoxifene showed 25-fold higher affinity for the ERα and 56-fold higher affinity for the ERβ than tamoxifen. The antiestrogenic potencies of endoxifen and afimoxifene are very similar. However, endoxifen occurs in much higher concentrations than afimoxifene and is now thought to be the major active form of tamoxifen in the body. Tamoxifen binds to ER competitively (with respect to the endogenous agonist estrogen) in tumor cells and other tissue targets, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis and inhibits estrogen effects. It is a nonsteroidal agent with potent antiestrogenic properties which compete with estrogen for binding sites in breast and other tissues. Tamoxifen causes cells to remain in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Because it prevents (pre)cancerous cells from dividing but does not cause cell death, tamoxifen is cytostatic rather than cytocidal. Tamoxifen binds to ER, the ER/tamoxifen complex recruits other proteins known as co-repressors, and the complex then binds to DNA to modulate gene expression. Some of these proteins include NCoR and SMRT. Tamoxifen function can be regulated by a number of different variables including growth factors. Tamoxifen needs to block growth factor proteins such as ErbB2/HER2 because high levels of ErbB2 have been shown to occur in tamoxifen resistant cancers. Tamoxifen seems to require a protein PAX2 for its full anticancer effect. In the presence of high PAX2 expression, the tamoxifen/ER complex is able to suppress the expression of the pro-proliferative ERBB2 protein. In contrast, when AIB-1 expression is higher than PAX2, tamoxifen/ER complex upregulates the expression of ERBB2 resulting in stimulation of breast cancer growth. Tamoxifen is antigonadotropic in postmenopausal women and partially suppresses levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in such women. However, it has progonadotropic effects in premenopausal women and increases estrogen levels by 6-fold in them. Due to the nature of tamoxifen as a competitive ER ligand, this increase in estrogen levels is liable to interfere with the antiestrogenic efficacy of tamoxifen. The effects of tamoxifen on breast cancer Ki-67 expression, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and IGF-1 levels are dose-dependent across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day in women with breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels by 17 to 38% in women and men. Suppression of IGF-1 production in the liver is a well-known action of estrogens and SERMs. A 10 mg/day dosage of tamoxifen is nearly as effective as a 20 mg/day dosage in suppressing IGF-1 levels. ==== Other activities ==== Afimoxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) with relatively low affinity. Its affinity for the receptor is in the range of 100 to 1,000 nM, relative to 3 to 6 nM for estradiol. In addition to its activity as a SERM, afimoxifene binds to both the estrogen-related receptor β and estrogen-related receptor γ and is an antagonist of the estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ). Norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen), another active metabolite of tamoxifen, has been found to act as a potent competitive aromatase inhibitor (IC50 = 90 nM), and may also be involved in the antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen. In addition to its activity as a SERM, tamoxifen is a potent and selective protein kinase C inhibitor, and is active in this regard at therapeutic concentrations. This action is thought to underlie the efficacy of tamoxifen in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Tamoxifen is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. In 2018, it was discovered that tamoxifen directly interacts with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and acts as an atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI). It has weak potency (54% inhibition of dopamine uptake at 10 μM) and lacks any stimulant or depressant effects when administered by itself. However, tamoxifen dose-dependently blocks amphetamine-mediated dopamine release and psychostimulant-like effects in animals. This unusual profile of DRI activity has made tamoxifen of potential interest as a starting point for structural modification to develop novel pharmaceutical drugs for treatment of stimulant use disorder. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Tamoxifen is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the intestines with oral administration. The oral bioavailability of tamoxifen is approximately 100%, which is suggestive of minimal first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver. Following intake, peak levels of tamoxifen occur after three to seven hours. Steady state levels of tamoxifen are reached typically after 3 to 4 weeks but possibly up to 16 weeks of daily administration. Steady state levels of afimoxifene are achieved after 8 weeks of daily tamoxifen administration. Peak levels of tamoxifen after a single 40 mg oral dose were 65 ng/mL and steady state levels at 20 mg/day were 310 ng/mL. Levels of tamoxifen show clear dose dependency across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day. Endoxifen levels are approximately 5 to 10 times higher than afimoxifene levels, with large interindividual variability. Endoxifen levels have been reported as 10.8 to 15.9 ng/mL at steady state in CYP2D6 normal metabolizers during therapy with 20 mg/day tamoxifen. The most abundant metabolites of tamoxifen in terms of circulating concentrations are N-desmethyltamoxifen, N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen, (Z)-endoxifen, and tamoxifen N-oxide. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution of tamoxifen is 50 to 60 L/kg and its clearance has been estimated as 1.2 to 5.1 L/hour. High concentrations of tamoxifen have been found in breast, uterus, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, and ovary tissue in animals and humans. Levels of tamoxifen in the uterus have been found to be 2- to 3-fold higher than in the circulation and in the breasts 10-fold higher than in the circulation. The plasma protein binding of tamoxifen and afimoxifene is greater than 99%. A majority of tamoxifen is bound to albumin. Albumin alone binds 98.8% of tamoxifen while other plasma proteins are not greatly involved. ==== Metabolism ==== Tamoxifen is a prodrug and is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 into active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen). Conversion of tamoxifen by N-demethylation into N-desmethyltamoxifen, which is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, is responsible for approximately 92% of tamoxifen metabolism. Conversely, 4-hydroxylation of tamoxifen into afimoxifene is responsible for only about 7% of tamoxifen metabolism. Following its formation, N-desmethyltamoxifen is oxidized into several other metabolites, the most notable of which is endoxifen. Another active metabolite, norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen), is formed via N-demethylation of endoxifen or 4-hydroxylation of N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen. Tamoxifen and its metabolites undergo conjugation, including glucuronidation and sulfation. Tamoxifen may inhibit its own metabolism. ==== Elimination ==== Tamoxifen has a long elimination half-life of typically 5 to 7 days, with a range of 4 to 11 days. Similarly, the half-life of afimoxifene is 14 days. Conversely, the half-life of endoxifen is 50 to 70 hours (2–3 days). The long half-lives of tamoxifen and afimoxifene are attributed to their high plasma protein binding as well as to enterohepatic recirculation. Upon discontinuation of treatment, levels of tamoxifen and its metabolites persist in the circulation for at least 6 weeks. Tamoxifen is excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces, while small amounts are eliminated in urine. == Chemistry == Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal SERM of the triphenylethylene family and was structurally derived from diethylstilbestrol-like estrogens and antiestrogens such as chlorotrianisene and ethamoxytriphetol. Initially, clomifene was synthesized, and tamoxifen was developed subsequently. Tamoxifen is closely related structurally to other triphenylethylenes, such as clomifene, nafoxidine, ospemifene, toremifene, and numerous others. Other SERMs, like raloxifene, are structurally distinct from tamoxifen and other triphenylethylenes. == History == In the late 1950s, pharmaceutical companies were actively researching a newly discovered class of anti-estrogen compounds in the hope of developing a morning-after contraceptive pill. Arthur L Walpole was a reproductive endocrinologist who led such a team at the Alderley Park research laboratories of ICI Pharmaceuticals. It was there in 1962 that chemist Dora Richardson first synthesized tamoxifen, back then known as ICI-46,474, when she was looking to create triphenylethylene derivatives for the contraceptive pill project that her team was researching. This compound was originally created to work as an estrogen inhibitor, but instead was found to stimulate ovulation in participants of the drug testing trial. Walpole and his colleagues filed a UK patent covering this compound in 1962, but patent protection on this compound was repeatedly denied in the US until the 1980s. Tamoxifen did eventually receive marketing approval as a fertility treatment, but the class of compounds never proved useful in human contraception. A link between estrogen and breast cancer had been known for many years, but cancer treatments were not a corporate priority at the time, and Walpole's personal interests were important in keeping support for the compound alive in the face of this and the lack of patent protection. It was only when Walpole threatened to leave his position that corporate decided to allow trials and testing for tamoxifen as a drug that could be used to treat breast cancer. Without Walpole's effort towards defending the work that his team had done in discovering a possibly revolutionary source for breast cancer treatment, tamoxifen could have become a discarded or under-researched idea. Walpole's team consisted of Dora Richardson and G. A. Snow, who worked on the chemistry portion of the project, along with G. E. Paget and J. K. Walley, who focused primarily on the biological side. Tamoxifen is one of three drugs in an anti-angiogenetic protocol developed by Dr. Judah Folkman, a researcher at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that angiogenesis – the growth of new blood vessels – plays a significant role in the development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on angiogenesis inhibitors have been underway since 1992 using many different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of celecoxib, doxycycline, and tamoxifen – the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol. Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen's ER antagonist properties. Other antiestrogens, such as ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) and clomifene (MRL-41), were assessed for treatment of breast cancer and found to be effective before tamoxifen, but were plagued with toxicity issues. The first clinical study of tamoxifen took place at the Christie Hospital in 1971, and showed a convincing effect in advanced breast cancer, but nevertheless ICI's development programme came close to termination when it was reviewed in 1972. In an unpublished article from the early days of the trial, Dora Richardson documented her team's excitement about tamoxifen's effects in counteracting infertility problems and the early positive effects found in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, this work was not well received by everyone, as the team was supposed to be looking for a contraceptive pill. Tamoxifen's further development may have been bolstered by a second clinical study by Harold W.C. Ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Ward's study showed a more definitive response to the drug at a higher dosage. Walpole also may have helped to convince the company to market tamoxifen for late stage breast cancer in 1973. He was also instrumental in funding V. Craig Jordan to work on tamoxifen. In 1972, ICI Pharmaceuticals Division abandoned development of tamoxifen for financial reasons. The drug was subsequently reinvented from a failed contraceptive, to become tamoxifen, the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and the pioneering medicine for chemprevention for high-risk women. Two books, Estrogen Action, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Women's Health (Imperial College Press 2013) and Tamoxifen: Pioneering Medicine in Breast Cancer (Springer 2013) tell this story. 1980 saw the publication of the first trial to show that tamoxifen given in addition to chemotherapy improved survival for patients with early breast cancer. In advanced disease, tamoxifen is now only recognized as effective in ER+ patients, but the early trials did not select ER+ patients, and by the mid-1980s the clinical trial picture was not showing a major advantage for tamoxifen. Nevertheless, tamoxifen had a relatively mild side-effect profile, and a number of large trials continued. The pharmacology of SERMs was discovered, defined, and deciphered during the 1980s. A clinical strategy was described that led to the creation of SERMs as a group of multifunctional medicines aimed at the treatment or prevention of many conditions in postmenopausal women, e.g. osteoporosis and breast cancer. The early sales of tamoxifen in both the UK and in the U.S. far exceeded ICI's original estimate, but despite this, at the annual portfolio review ICI's board members still asserted that ""there was no market for cancer"", leaving the drug's marketing success to rely on its clinical results and clinicians' and scientists' interests in it. Shortly after, Dora Richardson published a history of tamoxifen that, unusually for that type of paper, included personal accounts and letters from patients who attributed their healing to the drug. This testimony from cancer patients using tamoxifen helped to shape and push forward research, by justifying it both morally and scientifically to corporations. It was not until 1998 that the meta-analysis of the Oxford-based Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group showed definitively that tamoxifen was effective for early breast cancer. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Tamoxifen is marketed under the brand names Nolvadex and Soltamox, and a variety of other brand names throughout the world. === Economics === Global sales of tamoxifen in 2001 were approximately $1.02 billion. Since the expiration of the patent in 2002, it is widely available as a generic drug around the world. As of 2004, tamoxifen was the world's largest selling hormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer. == Research == In McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) tamoxifen has been used to treat premature puberty and the consequences of premature puberty. Tamoxifen has been seen to decrease rapid bone maturation which is the result of excessive estrogen and alter predicted adult height (PAH). The same effects have also been seen in short pubertal boys. However, one in vitro study in 2007 and later an in vivo study in 2008 have shown that tamoxifen induces apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes, reduces serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and causes persistent retardation of longitudinal and cortical radial bone growth in young male rats, leading the researchers to express concern giving tamoxifen to growing individuals. Tamoxifen has been studied in the treatment of the rare conditions of retroperitoneal fibrosis and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis. It has also been proposed as part of a treatment plan for Riedel's thyroiditis. Tamoxifen is used as a research tool to trigger tissue-specific gene expression in many conditional expression constructs in genetically modified animals including a version of the Cre-Lox recombination technique. While widely used in transgenic research, the strong anabolic effect of tamoxifen on bone might confound this approach, especially as it relates to bone-targeted constructs. Tamoxifen may be effective in the treatment of mania in people with bipolar disorder. This is thought to be due to blockade of protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme that regulates neuron activity in the brain. Researchers believe PKC is overactive during the mania in bipolar patients. As of September 2019, endoxifen, a major active metabolite of tamoxifen with a 4-fold more potent PKC inhibition, was in phase III clinical trials for bipolar disorder. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2014).

358	Linolenic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Linolenic acid is a type of naturally-occurring fatty acid. It can refer to either of two octadecatrienoic acids (i.e. with an 18-carbon chain and three double bonds, which are found in the cis configuration), or a mixture of the two. Linolenate (in the form of triglyceride esters of linolenic acid) is often found in vegetable oils; traditionally, such fatty acylates are reported as the fatty acids: α-Linolenic acid, an omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid γ-Linolenic acid, an omega-6 (n-6) fatty acid == See also == Linoleic acid, the similarly named essential fatty acid == References ==	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -1.640531e-05, 'OD': 0.0}
364	L-isoleucine	WIKIPEDIA	Isoleucine (symbol Ile or I) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a hydrocarbon side chain with a branch (a central carbon atom bound to three other carbon atoms). It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), branched-chain, aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it. Essential amino acids are necessary in the human diet. In plants isoleucine can be synthesized from threonine and methionine. In plants and bacteria, isoleucine is synthesized from a pyruvate employing leucine biosynthesis enzymes. It is encoded by the codons AUU, AUC, and AUA. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === In plants and microorganisms, isoleucine is synthesized from pyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate. This pathway is not present in humans. Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include: Acetolactate synthase (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase) Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase Dihydroxyacid dehydratase Valine aminotransferase === Catabolism === Isoleucine is both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. After transamination with alpha-ketoglutarate, the carbon skeleton is oxidised and split into propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is converted into succinyl-CoA, a TCA cycle intermediate which can be converted into oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis (hence glucogenic). In mammals acetyl-CoA cannot be converted to carbohydrate but can be either fed into the TCA cycle by condensing with oxaloacetate to form citrate or used in the synthesis of ketone bodies (hence ketogenic) or fatty acids. === Metabolic diseases === The degradation of isoleucine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) Methylmalonic acidemia Propionic acidemia === Insulin resistance === Isoleucine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is associated with insulin resistance: higher levels of isoleucine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans. In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of isoleucine (with or without the other branched-chain amino acids) results in reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity. Reduced dietary levels of isoleucine are required for the beneficial metabolic effects of a low protein diet. In humans, a protein restricted diet lowers blood levels of isoleucine and decreases fasting blood glucose levels. Mice fed a low isoleucine diet are leaner, live longer, and are less frail. In humans, higher dietary levels of isoleucine are associated with greater body mass index. == Functions and requirement == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine has set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For adults 19 years and older, 19 mg of isoleucine/kg body weight is required daily. Beside its biological role as a nutrient, isoleucine also participates in regulation of glucose metabolism. Isoleucine is an essential component of many proteins. As an essential amino acid, isoleucine must be ingested or protein production in the cell will be disrupted. Fetal hemoglobin is one of the many proteins that require isoleucine. Isoleucine is present in the gamma chain of fetal hemoglobin and must be present for the protein to form. Genetic diseases can change the consumption requirements of isoleucine. Amino acids cannot be stored in the body. Buildup of excess amino acids will cause a buildup of toxic molecules so, humans have many pathways to degrade each amino acid when the need for protein synthesis has been met. Mutations in isoleucine-degrading enzymes can lead to dangerous buildup of isoleucine and its toxic derivative. One example is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a disorder that leaves people unable to breakdown isoleucine, valine, and leucine. People with MSUD manage their disease by a reduced intake of all three of those amino acids alongside drugs that help excrete built-up toxins. Many animals and plants are dietary sources of isoleucine as a component of proteins. Foods that have high amounts of isoleucine include eggs, soy protein, seaweed, turkey, chicken, lamb, cheese, and fish. == Synthesis == Routes to isoleucine are numerous. One common multistep procedure starts from 2-bromobutane and diethylmalonate. Synthetic isoleucine was first reported in 1905 by French chemists Bouveault and Locquin. == Discovery == German chemist Felix Ehrlich discovered isoleucine while studying the composition of beet-sugar molasses 1903. In 1907 Ehrlich carried out further studies on fibrin, egg albumin, gluten, and beef muscle in 1907. These studies verified the natural composition of isoleucine. Ehrlich published his own synthesis of isoleucine in 1908. == See also == Alloisoleucine, the diasteromer of isoleucine Low Isoleucine protein foods == References == == External links == Isoleucine degradation Isoleucine biosynthesis	FOOD, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD	{'END': -0.23468846, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' FOOD': -9.610702e-06}
365	Arg-ile	PUBMED	 Endothelial cells are important cells in inflammatory responses (1, 2). Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), viruses, inflammation, and tissue injury increase secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and other cytokines and chemokines. Emigration of leukocytes from blood is dependent on their ability to roll along endothelial cell surfaces and subsequently adhere to endothelial cell surfaces. Inflammatory mediators and cytokines induce chemokine secretion from endothelial cells and other vascular cells and increase their expression of cell-surface adhesion molecules, such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), integrins, and selectins. Chemokines are chemotactic toward leukocytes and sites of inflammation and tissue injury. The movements of leukocytes through endothelial junctions into the extravascular space are highly orchestrated through various interactions with different adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (3). VCAM-1 is found in very low levels (often non-detectable) on the cell surface of resting endothelial cells and other vascular cells, such as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (4-8). VCAM-1 binds to its counterligand integrin, very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), on the cell surface of leukocytes. Inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF-α, increase expression of VCAM-1 and other cell adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelial cells, which leads to leukocyte adhesion to the activated endothelium. Furthermore, VCAM-1 expression was also induced by oxidized low-density lipoproteins under atherogenic conditions (1). Overexpression of VCAM-1 by atherosclerotic lesions plays an important role in their progression toward vulnerable plaques, which may erode and rupture. A synthetic peptide (Arg-Glu-Asn-Leu-Arg-Ile-Ala-Leu-Arg-Tyr, B2702-p) corresponding to residues 75–84 of HLA-B2702 was shown to bind specifically to VCAM-1 (9).  The characteristic ability of white blood cells (WBC) to accumulate at sites of infection and inflammation has been used as a tool for the detection of these pathological conditions. The leukocyte and monocyte components of the WBC have often been labeled under  Hexapeptides such as Ac-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH(2) and Ac-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Trp-Arg-NH(2) have been isolated from a combinatorial peptide library as small peptide ligands for the opioid peptide-like 1 (ORL1) receptor. To investigate the detailed structural requirements of hexapeptides, 25 analogs of these hexapeptides, based on the novel analog Ac-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Arg-NH(2) (1), were synthesized and tested for their ORL1 receptor affinity and agonist/antagonist activity on mouse vas deferens (MVD) tissues. Analog 1 and its Cit(6)-analog (10) were found to possess high affinity to the ORL1 receptor, comparable to that of nociceptin/orphanin FQ, and exhibited potent antagonist activity (pA(2) values of 7.77 for 1 and 7.51 for 10, which are higher than that of [NPhe(1)]nociceptin(1-13)-NH(2) (6.90) on MVD assay. It was also found that the amino acid residue in position 5 plays a key role in agonist/antagonist activity, i.e. an L-configuration aliphatic amino acid is required for potent antagonist activity, while a nonchiral or D-configuration residue produces potent agonist activity. These lines of evidence may provide insight into the mechanisms controlling agonist/antagonist switching in the ORL1 receptor, and may also serve to help developing more potent ORL1 agonists and antagonists.

373	Diprotin a	PUBMED	 It has been established that the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor Diprotin A TFA can reduce vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin disruption by inhibiting the increase in cleaved β-catenin in response to hypoxia, thereby protecting the vascular barrier of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In this study, we sought to investigate the possible effect of Diprotin A TFA on the VE barrier after cerebral ischemic stroke in mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups, namely, (1) sham, (2) stroke, (3) stroke + dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), (4) stroke + Diprotin A TFA, and (5) stroke + Diprotin A TFA + XAV-939. First, the cerebral ischemia model was established by photothrombotic ischemia, followed by intraperitoneal injection with Diprotin A TFA and XAV-939 at doses of 70 μg/kg and 40 mg/kg 30 min once in the morning and once in the evening for 3 days. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot methods were used to analyze the expression of vascular and blood-brain barrier (BBB)-associated molecular markers in the peri-infarct area. Compared with the vehicle control group, we found that mice injected with Diprotin A TFA exhibited reduced cerebral infarction volume, increased vascular area and length around the brain injury, increased pericyte and basement membrane coverage, upregulated expression of BBB tight junction proteins, and improved their BBB permeability, whereas the group injected with both drug and inhibitor exhibited significantly aggravated vascular injury and BBB permeability. Diprotin A TFA can reduce VE-cadherin disruption by inhibiting ischemia-hypoxia-induced β-catenin cleavage to protect blood vessels. The dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DP IV) inhibitor Diprotin A produces a full, dose-dependent, short-lasting and naloxone-reversible analgesia in the rat tail-flick test when given intracerebroventricularly, with an ED50 of 295 nmol/rat but it has no direct opioid agonist activity in the longitudinal muscle strip of guinea-pig ileum bioassay. Two of the potential DP IV substrates, morphiceptin and endomorphin 1, identified recently in bovine brain were also analgesic given by similar route. The action of endomorphin 1 was more potent (ED50 = 7.9 nmol/rat) and slightly but significantly more sustained than that of Diprotin A. Diprotin A neither potentiated nor prolonged the effect of a marginally analgesic dose of endomorphin 1. The distinct time course and the lack of potentiation indicate that in the analgesic effect of Diprotin A in rats the protection of a brain Tyr-Pro-peptide other than endomorphin 1 is involved. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV preferably hydrolyzes peptides and proteins with a penultimate proline residue. Umezawa and co-workers (Umezawa et al. (1984) J. Antibiotics 37, 422-425) reported that diprotin A (Ile-Pro-Ile) and diprotin B (Val-Pro-Leu) are inhibitors for dipeptidyl peptidase IV. We could show that both compounds as well as other tripeptides with a penultimate proline residue are substrates for dipeptidyl peptidase IV. An apparent competitive inhibition by those compounds is a kinetic artifact due to the substrate-like structure of such tripeptides.	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.014415113, 'ICAL': 0.0}
374	Ile-met	PUBMED	 Kokumi is a beneficial feeling for the evaluation of food quality, and thus, preparing and understanding the taste properties of kokumi compounds are important for the flavor of food. N-acetyl-Val/Leu/Ile/Met/Phe/Trp/Tyr is a type of kokumi compound found in food and usually prepared by chemical reagents. In this study, we first prepared these six kokumi compounds using transglutaminase and protease A2SD in aqueous solution by using amino acids and acetic acid as substrates and evaluated their kokumi characteristics. HPLC and LC-MS were used to identify quantitative N-acetyl amino acids. Using Phe and acetic acid as substrates, transglutaminase and protease A2SD showed the highest yields for N-acetyl-Phe of 22.75 and 42.21%, respectively, under the optimal conditions. For N-acetyl-Val/Leu/Ile/Met/Trp/Tyr, these two enzymes showed the synthesis yield in the ranges of 2.22-20.12 and 0.75-12.91%, respectively. Six N-acetyl-amino acids were succesully enriched by ethyl acetate with a recovery over 50% and purity over 95%. Sensory evaluation found that N-acetyl-Val/Leu/Ile/Met/Phe are kokumi compounds that enhance sweet, umami, and salt tastes in 5% sucrose, 0.3% NaCl, and 0.5% sodium glutamate, especially N-acetyl-Val, with the salt- and umami-enhancing threshold values of 0.63 and 1.25 g/L, respectively. Therefore, transglutaminase and protease A2SD for the synthesis of partial N-acetyl amino acid might have the potential to be applied in food as a kokumi compound. Pea (Pisum sativum) BP80 is a vacuolar sorting receptor for soluble proteins and has a cytosolic domain essential for its intracellular trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and the prevacuole. Based on mammalian knowledge, we introduced point mutations in the cytosolic region of the receptor and produced chimeras of green fluorescent protein fused to the transmembrane domain of pea BP80 along with the modified cytosolic tails. By analyzing the subcellular location of these chimera, we found that mutating Glu-604, Asp-616, or Glu-620 had mild effects, whereas mutating the Tyr motif partially redistributed the chimera to the plasma membrane. Replacing both Ile-608 and Met-609 by Ala (IMAA) led to a massive redistribution of fluorescence to the vacuole, indicating that recycling is impaired. When the chimera uses the alternative route, the IMAA mutation led to a massive accumulation at the plasma membrane. Using Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing a fluorescent reporter with the full-length sequence of At VSR4, we demonstrated that the receptor undergoes brefeldin A-sensitive endocytosis. We conclude that the receptors use two pathways, one leading directly to the lytic vacuole and the other going via the plasma membrane, and that the Ileu-608 Met-609 motif has a role in the retrieval step in both pathways. Theoretical conformational analysis was used to study the spatial structure and conformational properties of myelopeptides, bone marrow peptide mediators. The low-energy conformations of myelopeptides MP-4 (Phe-Arg-Pro-Arg-Ile-Met-Thr-Pro), MP-5 (Val-Val-Tyr-Pro-Asp), and MP-6 (Val-Asp-Pro-Pro) were found; the values of dihedral angles of backbone and side chains of the amino acid residues were determined; and the energies of intra- and interresidual interactions were estimated.

381	Monactin	PUBMED	 At a concentration of 10(-6)m, nigericin and monactin inhibited growth of Streptococcus faecalis, and the inhibition was reversed by addition of excess K(+). In the presence of certain antibiotics, the cells exhibited increased permeability to certain cations; internal Rb(+) was rapidly lost by exchange with external H(+), K(+) Rb(+), and, more slowly, with Na(+) and Li(+). No effect was observed on the penetration of other small molecules. Cation exchanges induced by nigericin and monactin were metabolically passive and apparently did not involve the energy-dependent K(+) pump. When the cells were washed, the cytoplasmic membrane recovered its original impermeability to cations. By use of monactin, we prepared cells whose K(+) content had been completely replaced by other cations, and the metabolic characteristics of K(+)-depleted cells were studied. Cells containing only Na(+) glycolyzed almost as well as did normal ones and, under proper conditions, could accumulate amino acids and orthophosphate. These cells also incorporated (14)C-uracil into ribonucleic acid but incorporation of (14)C-leucine into protein was strictly dependent upon the addition of K(+). When K(+) or Rb(+) was added to sodium-loaded cells undergoing glycolysis, these ions were accumulated by stoichiometric exchange for Na(+). From concurrent measurements of the rate of glycolysis, it was calculated that one mole-pair of cations was exchanged for each mole of adenosine triphosphate produced.

383	Ethambutol	WIKIPEDIA	Ethambutol (EMB, E) is a medication primarily used to treat tuberculosis. It is usually given in combination with other tuberculosis medications, such as isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. It may also be used to treat Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include problems with vision, joint pain, nausea, headaches, and feeling tired. Other side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people with optic neuritis, significant kidney problems, or under the age of five. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been found to cause harm. In the United States the FDA has raised concerns about eye issues in the baby if used during pregnancy. Ethambutol is believed to work by interfering with the bacteria's metabolism. Ethambutol was discovered in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and is available as a generic medication. == Chirality and biological activity == (S,S)-(+)-Ethambutol is powerful and selective antitubercular drug. It is a typical example of an old drug that was introduced for clinical use in its unichiral form. Ethambutol contains two constitutionally symmetrical chiral centers in its structure and exists in three stereoisomeric forms, the enantiomeric pair (+)-(S,S)- and (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol, along with the achiral stereoisomer called meso-form. The (+)-(S,S)-enantiomer harbors the antitubercular activity. This enantiomer is 500 and 12 fold more potent than (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol and the meso-form respectively. On the other hand, all the three isomers are equipotent in terms of the major side-effect of the drug, optic neuritis. Toxicity is associated to both dose and duration of treatment. Hence the use of (S,S)-enantiomer greatly improved the risk/benefit balance. == Medical uses == Ethambutol is used along with other medications to treat a number of infections including: tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. == Adverse effects == Optic neuritis (hence contraindicated in children below six years of age) Red–green color blindness People taking ethambutol should be monitored for changes in visual acuity and color discrimination. Arthralgia Hyperuricaemia Vertical nystagmus Skin rash == Mechanism of action == Ethambutol is bacteriostatic against actively growing TB bacilli. It works by obstructing the formation of cell wall. Mycolic acids attach to the 5'-hydroxyl groups of D-arabinose residues of arabinogalactan and form mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in the cell wall. It disrupts arabinogalactan synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyl transferase. Disruption of the arabinogalactan synthesis inhibits the formation of this complex and leads to increased permeability of the cell wall. == Pharmacokinetics == It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and well distributed in body tissues and fluids. 50% is excreted unchanged in urine. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}

391	Metoprolol acid	PUBMED	 Advancements on analytical strategies to determine the chemicals present in treated wastewater are necessary to clearly link their occurrence with the ecotoxicity of such effluents. This study describes the development of an integrated screening approach to determine the highest number of pharmaceutical transformation products (TPs) in a single run. The identification of TPs was based on the comparison of detected features with literature sources, compound prediction tools, in-house libraries and reference standards using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). This integrated approach allowed a better estimation (in silico) of the ecotoxicological contribution of the individual TPs identified. As a proof of concept, this methodology was applied for identification of the TPs generated from metoprolol and its main human metabolite (metoprolol acid) in pure water, hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater treated by UV/H Hospital wastewater (HWW) effluents represent an important source of contaminants such as pharmaceutical compounds and their human metabolites. To better evaluate dedicated treatment of hospital effluents for pollutant mitigation, not only the parent compounds should be considered but also the intermediates generated during treatment. The metabolite metoprolol acid (MTPA) has been found in urban wastewaters at higher concentration than its parent compound metoprolol (MTP), being more recalcitrant to biodegradation. The aim of this study was to investigate degradation, transformation and sorption of the β-blocker MTP, and its recalcitrant metabolite MTPA, during water treatment based on the fungi Ganoderma lucidum, Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus. Fourteen intermediates were identified in MTP biotransformation while five of them also attributed to MTPA biodegradation and two to MTPA only. Their identification allowed their correlation in separate biotransformation pathways suggested. The highest degradation rate of metoprolol (up to 51%) and metoprolol acid (almost 77%) was found after 15-days treatment with Ganoderma lucidum, with an increase in toxicity up to 29% and 4%, respectively. This fungus was further selected for treating real HWW in a batch fluidized bed bioreactor (FBB). Treated wastewater and fungal biomass samples were used to evaluate the distribution of the target compounds and the intermediates identified between solid and liquid phases. While similar elimination capabilities were observed for the removal of metoprolol, and even higher for its persistent metabolite metoprolol acid, the extent on compound transformation diminished considerably compared with the study treating purified water: a high level of the persistent α-HMTP and TP240 were still present in effluent samples (15% and 6%, respectively), being both TPs present at high proportion (up to 28%) in fungal biomass. This is the first time that pharmaceutical TPs have been investigated in the fungal biomass. A method for enantiomeric separation of the three β-blocking agents atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and the zwitterionic metoprolol acid, a major metabolite of both metoprolol and in environmental matrices also atenolol, has been developed. By use of supercritical fluid chromatography and the polysaccharide-based Chiralpak(®) IB-3, all four compounds were simultaneously enantiomerically separated (Rs>1.5) within 8min. Detection was performed using tandem mass spectrometry, and to avoid isobaric interference between the co-eluting metoprolol and metoprolol acid, the achiral column Acquity(®) UPC(2) BEH 2-EP was attached ahead of to the chiral column. Carbon dioxide with 18% methanol containing 0.5% (v/v) of the additives trifluoroacetic acid and ammonia in a 2:1 molar ratio were used as mobile phase. A post column make-up flow (0.3mL/min) of methanol containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid was used to enhance the positive electrospray ionization. Detection was carried out using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the selected reaction monitoring mode, using one transition per analyte and internal standard. The method was successfully applied for monitoring the enantiomeric fraction change over time in a laboratory scale wetland degradation study. It showed good precision, recovery, sensitivity and low effect of the sample matrix.	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -4.0961266e-05, 'ICAL': 0.0}
392	Sotalol	WIKIPEDIA	Sotalol, sold under the brand name Betapace among others, is a medication used to treat and prevent abnormal heart rhythms. Evidence does not support a decreased risk of death with long term use. It is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include a slow heart rate, chest pain, low blood pressure, feeling tired, dizziness, shortness of breath, problems seeing, vomiting, and swelling. Other serious side effects may include QT prolongation, heart failure, or bronchospasm. Sotalol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor blocker which has both class II and class III antiarrhythmic properties. Sotalol was first described in 1964 and came into medical use in 1974. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 296th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), sotalol can be validly used to maintain a normal heart rhythm in people with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), or very symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter. Due to the risk of serious side effects, the FDA states that sotalol should generally be reserved for people whose ventricular arrhythmias are life-threatening, or whose fibrillation/flutter cannot be resolved using the Valsalva maneuver or another simple method. Sotalol has shown some potential efficacy against symptoms of essential tremor due to its binding to the β2-adrenergic receptor but this remains an off-label use. == Contraindications == According to the FDA, sotalol should not be used in people with a waking heart rate lower than 50 beats per minute. It should not be used in people with sick sinus syndrome, long QT syndrome, cardiogenic shock, uncontrolled heart failure, asthma or a related bronchospastic condition, or people with serum potassium below 4 meq/L. It should only be used in people with a second and third degree AV block if a functioning pacemaker is present. Since sotalol is removed from the body through the kidneys, it should not be used in people with a creatinine clearance rate below 40 mL/min. It is also excreted in breast milk, so mothers should not breastfeed while taking sotalol. Since sotalol prolongs the QT interval, the FDA recommends against using it in conjunction with other medications that prolong the QT interval. Studies have found serious side effects to be more common in individuals also taking digoxin, possibly because of pre-existing heart failure in those people. As with other beta blockers, it may interact with calcium channel blockers, catecholamine-depleting drugs, insulin or antidiabetic drugs, β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, and clonidine. Some evidence suggests that sotalol should be avoided in the setting of heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (resulting in the heart squeezing little blood out into the circulation with each pump) due to an increased risk of death. == Adverse effects == Over 10% of oral sotalol users experience fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, weakness, nausea, shortness of breath, bradycardia (slow heart rate), a sensation of the heart beating too hard, fast, or irregularly, or chest pain. Higher doses of sotalol increase the risk for all of these possible side effects. In rare cases, the QT prolongation caused by sotalol can lead to the development of life-threatening torsade de pointes (TdP) polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Across several clinical trials, 0.6% of oral sotalol patients with supraventricular abnormal heart rhythms (such as atrial fibrillation) developed TdP. For patients who had a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (abnormal rhythm lasting more than 30 seconds), 4% developed TdP. Risk increases with dosage, female sex, or having a history of an enlarged heart or congestive heart failure. The incidence of TdP for sustained ventricular tachycardia patients was 0% with an 80 mg daily dose, 0.5% at 160 mg, 1.6% at 320 mg, 4.4% at 480 mg, 3.7% at 640 mg, and 5.8% at doses greater than 640 mg. Due to this risk, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires affected individuals to be hospitalized for at least three days in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring upon starting or restarting sotalol. == Pharmacology == === Mechanisms of action === ==== Beta-blocker action ==== Sotalol is a beta blocker and non-selectively binds to both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors preventing activation of the receptors by their stimulatory ligand (catecholamines). It has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Without the binding of catecholamines to the β-adrenergic receptor, the G protein complex associated with the receptor cannot activate production of cyclic AMP, which is responsible for turning on calcium inflow channels. A decrease in activation of calcium channels will therefore result in a decrease in intracellular calcium. In heart cells, calcium is important in generating electrical signals for heart muscle contraction, as well as generating force for this contraction. In consideration of these important properties of calcium, two conclusions can be drawn. First, with less calcium in the cell, there is a decrease in electrical signals for contraction, thus allowing time for the heart's natural pacemaker to rectify arrhythmic contractions. Secondly, lower calcium means a decrease in strength and rate of the contractions, which can be helpful in treatment of abnormally fast heart rates. ==== Type III antiarrhythmic action ==== Sotalol also acts on potassium channels and causes a delay in relaxation of the ventricles. By blocking these potassium channels, sotalol inhibits efflux of K+ ions, which results in an increase in the time before another electrical signal can be generated in ventricular myocytes. This increase in the period before a new signal for contraction is generated, helps to correct arrhythmias by reducing the potential for premature or abnormal contraction of the ventricles but also prolongs the frequency of ventricular contraction to help treat tachycardia. === Pharmacokinetics === Sotalol is classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects. == History == Sotalol was first synthesized in 1960 by A. A. Larsen of Mead-Johnson Pharmaceutical. It was originally recognized for its blood pressure lowering effects and its ability to reduce the symptoms of angina. It was made available in the United Kingdom and France in 1974, Germany in 1975, and Sweden in 1979. It became widely used in the 1980s. In the 1980s, its antiarrhythmic properties were discovered. The United States approved the drug in 1992. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Trade names for Sotalol include Betapace and Betapace AF (Berlex Laboratories), Sotalex and Sotacor (Bristol-Myers Squibb), and Sotylize (Arbor Pharmaceuticals). == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
393	Propranolol	WIKIPEDIA	"Propranolol is a medication of the beta blocker class. It is used to treat high blood pressure, some types of irregular heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, capillary hemangiomas, akathisia, performance anxiety, and essential tremors, as well to prevent migraine headaches, and to prevent further heart problems in those with angina or previous heart attacks. It can be taken orally or by intravenous injection. The formulation that is taken orally comes in short-acting and long-acting versions. Propranolol appears in the blood after 30 minutes and has a maximum effect between 60 and 90 minutes when taken orally. Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. It may worsen the symptoms of asthma. Propranolol may cause harmful effects for the baby if taken during pregnancy; however, its use during breastfeeding is generally considered to be safe. It is a non-selective beta blocker which works by blocking β-adrenergic receptors. Propranolol was patented in 1962 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Propranolol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 77th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Propranolol is used for treating various conditions, including: === Cardiovascular === Hypertension Angina pectoris (with the exception of variant angina) Myocardial infarction Tachycardia (and other sympathetic nervous system symptoms, such as muscle tremor) associated with various conditions, including anxiety, panic, hyperthyroidism, and lithium therapy Portal hypertension, to lower portal vein pressure Prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding and ascites Anxiety Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy While once a first-line treatment for hypertension, the role of beta blockers was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom to fourth-line, as they do not perform as well as other drugs, particularly in the elderly, and evidence is increasing that the most frequently used beta blockers at usual doses carry an unacceptable risk of provoking type 2 diabetes. Propranolol is not recommended for the treatment of high blood pressure by the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) because a higher rate of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to an angiotensin receptor blocker was noted in one study. === Psychiatric === Propranolol is occasionally used to treat performance anxiety, although evidence to support its use in any anxiety disorders is poor. Its efficacy in managing panic disorder appears similar to benzodiazepines, while carrying lower risks for addiction or abuse. Although beta-blockers such as propranolol have been suggested to be beneficial in managing physical symptoms of anxiety, its efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder remain unestablished. Some experimentation has been conducted in other psychiatric areas: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific phobias Aggressive behavior of patients with brain injuries Treating the excessive drinking of fluids in psychogenic polydipsia ==== PTSD and phobias ==== Propranolol is being investigated as a potential treatment for PTSD. Propranolol works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), a neurotransmitter that enhances memory consolidation. In one small study, individuals given propranolol immediately after trauma experienced fewer stress-related symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due to the fact that memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, propranolol can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as arachnophobia, dental fear, and social phobia. It has also been found to be helpful for some individuals with misophonia. Ethical and legal questions have been raised surrounding the use of propranolol-based medications for use as a ""memory damper"", including altering memory-recalled evidence during an investigation, modifying the behavioral response to past (albeit traumatic) experiences, the regulation of these drugs, and others. However, Hall and Carter have argued that many such objections are ""based on wildly exaggerated and unrealistic scenarios that ignore the limited action of propranolol in affecting memory, underplay the debilitating impact that PTSD has on those who suffer from it, and fail to acknowledge the extent to which drugs like alcohol are already used for this purpose"". === Other uses === Essential tremor. Evidence for use for akathisia however is insufficient Migraine and cluster headache prevention and in primary exertional headache Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) Infantile hemangioma Glaucoma Thyrotoxicosis by deiodinase inhibition Propranolol may be used to treat severe infantile hemangiomas (IHs). This treatment shows promise as being superior to corticosteroids when treating IHs. Extensive clinical case evidence and a small controlled trial support its efficacy. == Contraindications == Propranolol may be contraindicated in people with: Reversible airway diseases, particularly asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Slow heart rate (bradycardia) (<60 beats/minute) Sick sinus syndrome Atrioventricular block (second- or third-degree) Shock Severe low blood pressure == Adverse effects == Propranolol should be used with caution in people with: Diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism, since signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked Peripheral artery disease and Raynaud syndrome, which may be exacerbated Phaeochromocytoma, as hypertension may be aggravated without prior alpha blocker therapy Myasthenia gravis, which may be worsened Other drugs with bradycardic effects === Pregnancy and lactation === Propranolol, like other beta-blockers, is classified as pregnancy category C in the United States and ADEC category C in Australia. β-blocking agents in general reduce perfusion of the placenta, which may lead to adverse outcomes for the neonate, including lung or heart complications, or premature birth. The newborn may experience additional adverse effects such as low blood sugar and a slower than normal heart rate. Most β-blocking agents appear in the milk of lactating women. However, propranolol is highly bound to proteins in the bloodstream and is distributed into breast milk at very low levels. These low levels are not expected to pose any risk to the breastfeeding infant, and the American Academy of Pediatrics considers propranolol therapy ""generally compatible with breastfeeding."" == Overdose == In overdose, propranolol is associated with seizures. Cardiac arrest may occur in propranolol overdose due to sudden ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock which may ultimately culminate in bradycardic PEA. == Interactions == Since beta blockers are known to relax the cardiac muscle and constrict the smooth muscle, beta-adrenergic antagonists, including propranolol, have an additive effect with other drugs that decrease blood pressure or decrease cardiac contractility or conductivity. Clinically significant interactions particularly occur with: Verapamil Epinephrine (adrenaline) β2-adrenergic receptor agonists Salbutamol (albuterol), levosalbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, clenbuterol, others Clonidine Ergot alkaloids Isoprenaline (isoproterenol) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Quinidine Cimetidine Lidocaine Phenobarbital Rifampicin Fluvoxamine (slows down the metabolism of propranolol significantly, leading to increased blood levels of propranolol) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Propranolol is classified as a competitive non-cardioselective sympatholytic beta blocker that crosses the blood–brain barrier. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel-blocking effects. Propranolol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or beta blocker; that is, it blocks the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. It has little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, but has strong membrane stabilizing activity (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. overdose). Propranolol can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects in the central nervous system in addition to its peripheral activity. In addition to blockade of adrenergic receptors, propranolol has very weak inhibitory effects on the norepinephrine transporter and/or weakly stimulates norepinephrine release (i.e., the concentration of norepinephrine is increased in the synapse). Since propranolol blocks β-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic norepinephrine only results in α-adrenoceptor activation, with the α1-adrenoceptor being particularly important for effects observed in animal models. Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect α1-adrenoceptor agonist in addition to potent β-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition to its effects on the adrenergic system, there is evidence that indicates that propranolol may act as a weak antagonist of certain serotonin receptors, namely the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2B receptors. The latter may be involved in the effectiveness of propranolol in the treatment of migraine at high doses. Both enantiomers of propranolol have a local anesthetic (topical) effect, which is normally mediated by blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Studies have demonstrated propranolol's ability to block cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal voltage-gated sodium channels, accounting for its known membrane stabilizing effect and antiarrhythmic and other central nervous system effects. === Mechanism of action === Propranolol is a non-selective beta receptor antagonist. This means that it does not have preference to β1 or β2 receptors. It competes with sympathomimetic neurotransmitters for binding to receptors, which inhibits sympathetic stimulation of the heart. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β1 receptors on cardiac myocytes inhibits activation of adenylate cyclase, which in turn inhibits cAMP synthesis leading to reduced Protein kinase A (PKA) activation. This results in less calcium influx to cardiac myocytes through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels meaning there is a decreased sympathetic effect on cardiac cells, resulting in antihypertensive effects including reduced heart rate and lower arterial blood pressure. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β2 receptors on smooth muscle cells will increase contraction, which will increase hypertension. === Pharmacokinetics === Propranolol is rapidly and completely absorbed, with peak plasma levels achieved about 1–3 hours after ingestion. More than 90% of the drug is found bound to plasma protein in the blood. Coadministration with food appears to enhance bioavailability. Despite complete absorption, propranolol has a variable bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Hepatic impairment therefore increases its bioavailability. Propranolol can be absorbed along the whole intestine with the main absorption site being the colon, which means people who have lost their colon due to surgery may absorb relatively less percentage of propranolol. The main metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol, with a longer half-life (5.2–7.5 hours) than the parent compound (3–4 hours), is also pharmacologically active. Most of the metabolites are excreted in the urine. Propranolol is a highly lipophilic drug achieving high concentrations in the brain. The duration of action of a single oral dose is longer than the half-life and may be up to 12 hours if the single dose is high enough (e.g., 80 mg). Effective plasma concentrations are between 10 and 100 mg/L. Toxic levels are associated with plasma concentrations above 2000 mg/L. == History == Scottish scientist James W. Black developed propranolol in the 1960s. It was the first beta-blocker effectively used in the treatment of coronary artery disease and hypertension. Newer, more cardio-selective beta blockers (such as bisoprolol, nebivolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol) are used preferentially in the treatment of hypertension. == Society and culture == In a 1987 study by the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, it was reported that 27% of interviewed members said they used beta blockers such as propranolol for musical performances. For about 10–16% of performers, their degree of stage fright is considered pathological. Propranolol is used by musicians, actors, and public speakers for its ability to treat anxiety symptoms activated by the sympathetic nervous system. It has also been used as a performance-enhancing drug in sports where high accuracy is required, including archery, shooting, golf, and snooker. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, 50-metre pistol silver medalist and 10-metre air pistol bronze medalist Kim Jong-su tested positive for propranolol and was stripped of his medals. === Brand names === Propranolol was first marketed under the brand name Inderal, manufactured by ICI Pharmaceuticals (now AstraZeneca), in 1965. ""Inderal"" is a quasi-anagram of ""Alderlin"", the trade name of pronethalol (which propranolol replaced); both names are an homage to Alderley Park, the ICI headquarters where the drugs were first developed. Propranolol is also marketed under brand names Avlocardyl, Deralin, Dociton, Inderalici, InnoPran XL, Indoblok, Sumial, Anaprilin, and Bedranol SR (Sandoz). In India, it is marketed under brand names such as Ciplar and Ciplar LA by Cipla. Hemangeol, a 4.28 mg/mL solution of propranolol, is indicated for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma. == References == == Further reading == Stapleton MP (1997).

394	Atenolol	WIKIPEDIA	Atenolol is a beta blocker medication primarily used to treat high blood pressure and heart-associated chest pain. Although used to treat high blood pressure, it does not seem to improve mortality in those with the condition. Other uses include the prevention of migraines and treatment of certain irregular heart beats. It is taken orally (by mouth) or by intravenous injection (injection into a vein). It can also be used with other blood pressure medications. Common side effects include feeling tired, heart failure, dizziness, depression, and shortness of breath. Other serious side effects include bronchial spasm. Use is not recommended during pregnancy and alternative drugs are preferred when breastfeeding. It works by blocking β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart, thus decreasing heart rate, force of heart beats, and blood pressure. Atenolol was patented in 1969 and approved for medical use in 1975. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 63rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Atenolol is used for a number of conditions including hyperthyroidism, hypertension, angina, long QT syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The role for β-blockers in general in hypertension was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom, and later in the United States, as they are less appropriate than other agents such as ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics and angiotensin receptor blockers, particularly in the elderly. === Available forms === Atenolol is available in the form of 25, 50, and 100 mg oral tablets. It is also available in the form of oral tablets containing a combination of 50 or 100 mg atenolol and 50 mg chlortalidone. Atenolol was previously available in a 0.5 mg/mL solution for injection as well, but this formulation was discontinued. == Side effects == Hypertension treated with a β-blocker such as atenolol, alone or in conjunction with a thiazide diuretic, is associated with a higher incidence of new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to those treated with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. β-blockers, of which atenolol is mainly studied, provides weaker protection against stroke and mortality in patients over 60 years old compared to other antihypertensive medications. Diuretics may be associated with better cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes than β-blockers in the elderly. Rarely, atenolol has been associated with induction of acute delirium. == Overdose == Symptoms of overdose are due to excessive pharmacodynamic actions on β1 and also β2-receptors. These include bradycardia (slow heartbeat), severe hypotension with shock, acute heart failure, hypoglycemia and bronchospastic reactions. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Hospitalization and intensive monitoring is indicated. Activated charcoal is useful to absorb the drug. Atropine will counteract bradycardia, glucagon helps with hypoglycemia, dobutamine can be given against hypotension and the inhalation of a β2-mimetic such as hexoprenalin or salbutamol will terminate bronchospasms. Blood or plasma atenolol concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 3 mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 3–30 mg/L in overdose victims. == Interactions == Interactions with atenolol include catecholamine-depleting drugs like reserpine, calcium channel blockers, disopyramide, amiodarone, clonidine, prostaglandin synthase inhibitors like indomethacin, and digitalis glycosides. Most of these interactions involve either additive cardiovascular effects or reduction of atenolol's effects. Atenolol is mainly eliminated renally without being metabolized by the liver or by cytochrome P450 enzymes. As a result, it has little or no potential for cytochrome P450-related drug interactions, for instance with inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes. Accordingly, the broad/non-selective cytochrome P450 inhibitor cimetidine had no effect on atenolol levels, whereas cimetidine has been found to significantly increase metoprolol and propranolol levels. Beta blockers like atenolol can reduce or block the cardiovascular effects of sympathomimetics and amphetamines, such as hypertension and tachycardia. Atenolol has been found to be safe in combination with the non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine and actually improved orthostatic hypotension and hypertensive reactions with phenelzine. However, more research is still needed to assess whether addition of a beta blocker like atenolol to MAOI therapy is safe and effective for improving orthostatic hypotension with MAOIs. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Atenolol is a beta blocker; that is, an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is specifically a selective antagonist of the β1-adrenergic receptor with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (i.e., partial agonist activity) or membrane-stabilizing activity. However, the preferential action of atenolol is not absolute, and at high doses, it can also block β2-adrenergic receptors. Beta-blocking effects of atenolol include reduction in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and with exercise, inhibition of tachycardia induced by isoproterenol (a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist), and reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia. The beta-blocking effects of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise-related tachycardia, are apparent within 1 hour and are maximal within 2 to 4 hours following a single oral dose. The general effects of atenolol, including beta-blocking and antihypertensive effects, last for at least 24 hours following oral doses of 50 or 100 mg. With intravenous administration, maximal reduction in exercise-related tachycardia occurs within 5 minutes and following a single 10 mg dose has dissipated within 12 hours. The duration of action of atenolol is dose-related and is correlated with circulating levels of atenolol. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The oral bioavailability of atenolol is approximately 50 to 60%. The absorption of atenolol with oral administration is rapid and consistent but is incomplete. About 50% of an oral dose of atenolol is absorbed from the intestines, with the rest excreted in feces. Maximal concentrations of atenolol occur 2 to 4 hours following an oral dose, whereas peak concentrations occur within 5 minutes with intravenous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of atenolol results in it having relatively consistent plasma drug levels with about 4-fold variation between individuals. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of atenolol is 6 to 16%. Atenolol is classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier and entering the brain. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects. Only small amounts of atenolol are said to enter the brain. The brain-to-blood ratio of atenolol was 0.2 : 1 in one study, whereas the ratio for propranolol was 33 : 1 in the same study. ==== Metabolism ==== Atenolol undergoes minimal or negligible metabolism by the liver. It has been estimated that about 5% of atenolol is metabolized. This is in contrast to other beta blockers like propranolol and metoprolol, but is similar to nadolol. In accordance with its lack of hepatic metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of atenolol are not altered in hepatic impairment, unlike the case of propranolol. Two metabolites of atenolol have been identified: hydroxyatenolol and atenolol glucuronide. It has been said that it is unknown if these metabolites are active. However, another source stated that hydroxyatenolol has one-tenth the beta-blocking activity of atenolol. ==== Elimination ==== Instead of by hepatic metabolism, atenolol is eliminated from the blood mainly via renal excretion. Atenolol is excreted about 40 to 50% in urine and 50% in feces with oral administration. Conversely, it is excreted 85 to 100% in urine unchanged and 10% in feces with intravenous administration. Only very small amounts of hydroxyatenolol and atenolol glucuronide are found in urine with atenolol. The elimination half-life of atenolol is about 6 to 7 hours. The half-life of atenolol does not change with continuous administration. With intravenous administration, atenolol levels rapidly decline (5- to 10-fold) during the first 7 hours and thereafter decline at a rate similar to that with oral administration. The elimination of atenolol is slowed in renal impairment, with the elimination rate being closely related to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and with significant accumulation occurring when the creatinine clearance rate is under 35 mL/min/1.73 m2. At a GFR of less than 10 mL/min, the half-life of atenolol increases up to 36 hours. == Chemistry == Atenolol is a substituted phenethylamine derivative. It is specifically β-phenylethylamine with an α-keto substitution and a 4- substitution on the phenyl ring. The experimental log P of atenolol is 0.16 and its predicted log P ranges from −0.03 to 0.57. Atenolol is closely structurally related to metoprolol and certain other beta blockers. It is also structurally related to the catecholamine neurotransmitters epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). == Society and culture == === Changing medical practices === Atenolol has been given as an example of how slow healthcare providers are to change their prescribing practices in the face of medical evidence that indicates that a drug is not as effective as others in treating some conditions. In 2012, 33.8 million prescriptions were written to American patients for this drug. In 2014, it was in the top (most common) 1% of drugs prescribed to Medicare patients. Although the number of prescriptions has been declining steadily since limited evidence articles contesting its efficacy was published, it has been estimated that it would take 20 years for doctors to stop prescribing it for hypertension. Despite its diminished efficacy when compared to newer antihypertensive drugs, atenolol and other beta blockers are still a relevant clinical choice for treating some conditions, since beta blockers are a diverse group of medicines with different properties that still requires further research. As consequence, reasons for the popularity of beta blockers cannot be fully attributed to a slow healthcare system – patient compliance factor, such as treatment cost and duration, also affect adherence and popularity of therapy. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
395	Guineensine	WIKIPEDIA	Guineesine (or guineensine) is a compound isolated from long pepper (Piper longum) and black pepper (Piper nigrum). It was first isolated, studied and named from Piper guineense. == Research == Guineensine inhibits the cellular reuptake of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in a mouse model (EC50 = 290 nM). This causes an increase in the activity of the two neurotransmitters which are classified as endogenous cannabinoids. Guineesine can dose-dependently produce cannabimimetic effects in a mouse model which are indicated by potent catatonic, analgesic, hypo-locomotive and hypo-thermic effects. In addition, the analgesic and catatonic effects were reversed by the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) inverse agonist rimonabant. Guineesine is also a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) in vitro (IC50 = 139.2 μM). == References ==	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -0.00038050648, 'OD': 0.0}
398	Surfactin	WIKIPEDIA	"Surfactin is a cyclic lipopeptide, commonly used as an antibiotic for its capacity as a surfactant. It is an amphiphile capable of withstanding hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments. The Gram-positive bacterial species Bacillus subtilis produces surfactin for its antibiotic effects against competitors. Surfactin showcases antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and hemolytic effects. == Structure and Synthesis == The structure consists of a peptide loop of seven amino acids (L-glutamic acid, L-leucine, D-leucine, L-valine, L-aspartic acid, D-leucine, and L-leucine) and a β-hydroxy fatty acid of variable length, thirteen to fifteen carbon atoms long. The glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues give the ring its hydrophilic character, as well as its negative charge. Conversely, the valine residue extends down, facing the fatty acid chain, to form a major hydrophobic domain. Below critical micellar concentrations (CMCs), the fatty acid tail can extend freely into solution, participating in hydrophobic interactions within micelles. This antibiotic is synthesized by a linear nonribosomal peptide synthetase, surfactin synthetase (Q04747). In solution, it has a characteristic ""horse saddle"" conformation (PDB: 2NPV) that explains its large spectrum of biological activity. == Physical properties == === Surface tension === Surfactin, like other surfactants, affects the surface tension of liquids in which it is dissolved. It can lower the water's surface tension from 72 mN/m to 27 mN/m at concentrations as low as 20 μM. Surfactin accomplishes this effect by occupying the intermolecular space between water molecules, decreasing the attractive forces between adjacent water molecules, mainly hydrogen bonds, to increase the solution's fluidity. This property makes surfactin and other surfactants useful as detergents and soaps. === Molecular mechanisms === There are three prevailing hypotheses for how surfactin works. ==== Cation-carrier effect ==== The cation-carrier effect is characterized by surfactin's ability to drive monovalent and divalent cations through an organic barrier. The two acidic residues aspartate and glutamate form a ""claw"" to stabilize divalent cations, such as Ca2+ ions used as an assembly template for the formation of micelles. When surfactin penetrates the outer sheet, its fatty acid chain interacts with the acyl chains of the phospholipids, orienting its headgroup toward the phospholipids' polar heads. Attachment of a cation causes the complex to cross the bilipidic layer using flippase enzymes. The headgroup aligns itself with the phospholipids of the inner sheet and the fatty acid chain interacts with the phospholipids acyl chains. The cation is then delivered into the intracellular medium. ==== Pore-forming effect ==== The pore-forming (ion channel) effect is characterized by the formation of cationic channels. It requires surfactin to self-associate inside the membrane since it cannot span across the cellular membrane. Under a hypothesis focused on uncharged membranes with minimal activation energy required to cross between inner and outer leaflets, molecular self-assembly would form a channel structure. ==== Detergent effect ==== The detergent effect draws on surfactin's ability to insert its fatty acid chain into the phospholipid layer, disorganizing the cell membrane to increase its permeability. Insertion of several surfactin molecules into the membrane can lead to the formation of mixed micelles by self-association and bilayer influenced by fatty chain hydrophobicity ultimately leading to bilayer solubilization. == Biological properties == === Antibacterial and antiviral properties === Surfactin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with detergent-like activity increasing the permeability of cell membranes in all bacteria, regardless of their Gram stain classification. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of surfactin is between 12-50 μg/ml. Surfactin is also capable of degrading viral envelope lipids and forming ion channels in the inner capsid with experimental evidence showing inhibition of HIV and HSV. However, surfactin can only degrade viruses when they are outside of host cells. Furthermore, when the environment is packed with proteins and lipids, surfactin faces a buffer effect lowering its antiviral activity. === Toxicity === Surfactin has non-specific cytotoxicity, causing lysis through disruption to the phospholipid bilayer present in all cells. When injected into humans as an intravascular antibiotic at concentrations at or above the LD50 of 40-80 μM, surfactin has hemolytic effects. == See also == Mycosubtilin == References =="	MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL	INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL	{'IND': -0.35224032, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0, ',': -0.012507889, ' MED': -0.050323837, 'ICAL': 0.0}
400	Atorvastatin	WIKIPEDIA	"Atorvastatin is a statin medication used to prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and to treat abnormal lipid levels. For the prevention of cardiovascular disease, statins are a first-line treatment. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include joint pain, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, and muscle pains. Serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis, liver problems, and diabetes. Use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Like all statins, atorvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in the liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol. Atorvastatin was patented in 1986, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 109 million prescriptions filled for over 27 million people. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == The primary uses of atorvastatin is for the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease: === Dyslipidemia === Hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb) to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, apo-B, triglycerides levels, and CRP as well as increase HDL levels. Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in children Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia Hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson Type IV) Primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) Combined hyperlipidemia === Cardiovascular disease === Primary prevention of heart attack, stroke, and need for revascularization procedures in people who have risk factors such as age, smoking, high blood pressure, low HDL-C, and a family history of early heart disease, but have not yet developed evidence of coronary artery disease. Secondary prevention of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, major coronary events, ischaemic heart disease and revascularization in people with established coronary artery disease. The effect is dose dependent and is amplified at higher doses. Close monitoring of liver function tests is required when high doses is used. Myocardial infarction and stroke prevention in people with type 2 diabetes A 2014 meta-analysis showed high-dose statin therapy was significantly superior compared to moderate or low-intensity statin therapy in reducing plaque volume in people with acute coronary syndrome. The SATURN trial, which compared the effects of high-dose atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, also confirmed these findings. === Kidney disease === There is evidence from systematic review and meta-analyses that statins, particularly atorvastatin, reduce both decline in kidney function (eGFR) and the severity of protein excretion in urine, with higher doses having greater effect. Data are conflicting for whether statins reduce risk of kidney failure. Statins, including atorvastatin, before heart surgery do not prevent acute kidney injury. Prior to contrast medium (CM) administration, pre-treatment with atorvastatin therapy can reduce the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in people with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m2) who undergo interventional procedures such as cardiac catheterisation, coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A meta-analysis of 21 RCTs confirmed that high dose (80 mg) atorvastatin therapy is more effective than regular dose or low dose statin therapy at preventing CI-AKI. Atorvastatin therapy can also help to prevent in-hospital dialysis post CM administration, however there is no evidence that it reduces all-cause mortality associated with CI-AKI. Overall, the evidence concludes that statin therapy, irrespective of the dose, is still more effective than no treatment or placebo at reducing the risk of CI-AKI. === Administration === Statins (predominantly simvastatin) have been evaluated in clinical trials in combination with fibrates to manage dyslipidemia in people who also have type 2 diabetes, and a high cardiovascular disease risk; however, there is limited clinical benefit noted for most cardiovascular outcomes. Statins with shorter half-lives are more effective when taken in the evening, so their peak effect occurs when the body’s natural cholesterol production is at its highest. A recent meta-analysis suggested that statins with longer half-lives, including atorvastatin, may also be more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol if taken in the evening. However, the only study included in the meta-analysis of atorvastatin in people with heart disease did not specifically investigate if morning or evening dosing was more effective for reducing LDL cholesterol. The trial did confirm that, irrespective of dosing time, atorvastatin is very effective at reducing total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and increasing HDL cholesterol levels. Hence, atorvastatin should be taken at the same time each day, at a time that is most convenient for the patient, so it does not compromise compliance. === Specific populations === Geriatric: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in healthy elderly subjects are higher than those in young adults. However, clinical data suggests there is a similar reduction of LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular events at any dose in this population and adults younger than 65 years of age. Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data is not available for this population. Gender: Plasma concentrations are generally higher in women than in men, but there is no clinically significant difference in the extent of LDL reduction between men and women. Kidney impairment: Kidney disease has no statistically significant influence on plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and dose adjustment considerations should only be made in context of the patient's overall health. Hemodialysis: Although there has been moderate-to-high quality of evidence to show the lack of clear and significant clinical benefits of statins (including atorvastatin at a dose of 20mg) minimizing non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality in adults on hemodialysis (including those with diabetes and/or pre-existing cardiovascular diseases) despite the clinically relevant reduction in total/LDL cholesterol levels, there is evidence that people undergoing hemodialysis who received moderate intensity statin therapy had a lower risk of all-cause mortality. However, data (post hoc analysis) on atorvastatin has revealed that it may still be beneficial in reducing combined cardiac events, cardiac and all-cause mortality in those with a higher baseline LDL cholesterol >3.75 mmol/L. While the SHARP study suggested that LDL cholesterol-lowering treatments (e.g. statin/ezetimibe combination) are effective in reducing the risks of major atherosclerotic events in people with CKD including those on dialysis, the subgroup analysis of the people undergoing hemodialysis had revealed no significant benefits. Whether or not hemodialysis has any impact on the statin levels was not specifically addressed in these major trials. Liver impairment: Increased drug levels can be seen in people with advanced cirrhosis. Despite these concerns, a 2017 systematic review and analysis of available evidence has shown that statins, such as atorvastatin, are relatively safe to use in stable, asymptomatic cirrhosis and may even reduce the risk of liver disease progression and death. == Contraindications == Active liver disease: cholestasis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatitis, and jaundice Pregnancy: Atorvastatin is unlikely to cause fetal anomalies but may be associated with low birth weight and preterm labor. Breastfeeding: Small amounts of other statin medications have been found to pass into breast milk, although atorvastatin has not been studied specifically. Due to risk of disrupting a breastfeeding infant's metabolism of lipids, atorvastatin is not regarded as compatible with breastfeeding. Markedly elevated CPK levels or if a myopathy is suspected or diagnosed after dosing of atorvastatin has begun. Very rarely, atorvastatin may cause rhabdomyolysis, and it may be very serious leading to acute kidney injury due to myoglobinuria. When rhabdomyolysis is suspected or diagnosed, atorvastatin therapy is discontinued immediately. The likelihood of developing a myopathy is increased by the co-administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin, and azole antifungals. == Side effects == === Major === Type 2 diabetes is observed in a small number of people, and is an uncommon class effect of all statins. It appears it may be more likely in people who were already at a higher risk of developing diabetes before starting a statin due to multiple risk factors, for example raised fasting glucose levels. However, the benefits of statin therapy in preventing fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal coronary heart disease, and non-fatal myocardial infarction are significant. For most people the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh the risk of developing diabetes. A 2010 meta-analysis demonstrated that every 255 people treated with a statin for four years produced a reduction of 5.4 major coronary events and induced only one new case of diabetes. In some case and clinical studies mild muscle pain or weakness have been reported (around 3%), compared to a placebo. However, this increase was not related to statin therapy in 90% of cases in a large meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. In patients taking higher statin doses, a similarly low increase in muscle pain and weakness was present (5%) with no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship. Duration of treatment with atorvastatin is unlikely to increase the risk of muscle-related side effects as most occur within the first year of treatment, after which the risk is not increased further. The known cardiovascular benefits of atorvastatin over time outweigh the low risk of muscle-related side effects. Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is rare, occurring in less than 0.1% of people who take statins. Statin induced rhabdomyolysis, as with other statin associated muscle symptoms, occurs most commonly in the first year of treatment but can occur at any time during treatment. Risk factors for statin induced rhabdomyolysis include older age, renal impairment, high dose statins and use of medications that reduce the breakdown of statins (such as CYP3A4 inhibitors) or fibrates. Persistent liver enzyme abnormalities (usually elevated in hepatic transaminases) have been documented. Elevations threefold greater than normal were recorded in 0.5% of people treated with atorvastatin 10 mg-80 mg rather than placebo. Usage instructions in package inserts for this statin define the requirement that hepatic function be assessed with laboratory tests before beginning atorvastatin treatment and repeated periodically as clinically indicated - usually a clinicians' judgement. Package inserts for this statin recommend actions should liver abnormalities be detected. Ultimately, this is the judgment of the prescribing physician. === Common === The following have been shown to occur in 1–10% of people taking atorvastatin in clinical trials: Joint pain Loose stools Indigestion Muscle pain Nausea === Other === ==== Increased fasting blood glucose ==== Atorvastatin has been associated with a small increase in fasting blood glucose levels over a 2-year period, particularly in patients with Type 2 Diabetes, however evidence is conflicting and clinical significance of this increase has not been determined. Regular blood glucose monitoring may be advised in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. ==== Cognitive ==== There have been rare reports of reversible memory loss and confusion with all statins, including atorvastatin; however, there has not been enough evidence to associate statin use with cognitive impairment, and the risks for cognition are likely outweighed by the beneficial effects of adherence to statin therapy on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. ==== Pancreatitis ==== A 2012 meta-analysis found that statin therapy might reduce the risk of pancreatitis in people with normal or mildly elevated blood triglyceride levels. ==== Erectile dysfunction ==== Statins seem to have a positive effect on erectile dysfunction. === Interactions === Fibrates are a class of drugs that can be used for severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidaemia in combination with statins or as monotherapy. While studies have suggested that the combined use of statins and the fibrate drug class (such as gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, there is insufficient evidence to firmly establish this association with atorvastatin. Co-administration of atorvastatin with one of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This is less likely to happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin. Antacids can rarely decrease the plasma concentrations of statin medications, but do not affect the LDL-C-lowering efficacy. Niacin also is proved to increase the risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Some statins may also alter the concentrations of other medications, such as warfarin or digoxin, leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring. The increase in digoxin levels due to atorvastatin is a 1.2 fold elevation in the area under the curve (AUC), resulting in a minor drug-drug interaction. The American Heart Association states that the combination of digoxin and atorvastatin is reasonable. In contrast to some other statins, atorvastatin does not interact with warfarin concentrations in a clinically meaningful way (similar to pitavastatin). Vitamin D supplementation lowers atorvastatin and active metabolite concentrations, yet synergistically reduces LDL and total cholesterol concentrations. Grapefruit juice components are known inhibitors of intestinal CYP3A4. Drinking grapefruit juice with atorvastatin may cause an increase in Cmax and area under the curve (AUC). This finding initially gave rise to concerns of toxicity, and in 2000, it was recommended that people taking atorvastatin should not consume grapefruit juice ""in an unsupervised manner."" Small studies (using mostly young participants) examining the effects of grapefruit juice consumption on mainly lower doses of atorvastatin have shown that grapefruit juice increases blood levels of atorvastatin, which could increase the risk of adverse effects. No studies assessing the impact of grapefruit juice consumption have included participants taking the highest dose of atorvastatin (80 mg daily), which is often prescribed for people with a history of cardiovascular disease (such as heart attack or ischaemic stroke) or in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease. People taking atorvastatin should consult with their doctor or pharmacist before consuming grapefruit juice, as the effects of grapefruit juice consumption on atorvastatin will vary according to factors such as the amount and frequency of juice consumption in addition to differences in juice components, quality and method of juice preparation between different batches or brands. A few cases of myopathy have been reported when atorvastatin is given with colchicine. == Mechanism of action == As with other statins, atorvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Unlike most others, however, it is a completely synthetic compound. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, which is the rate-limiting step in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of the enzyme decreases de novo cholesterol synthesis, increasing expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL receptors) on hepatocytes. This increases LDL uptake by the hepatocytes, decreasing the amount of LDL-cholesterol in the blood. Like other statins, atorvastatin also reduces blood levels of triglycerides and slightly increases levels of HDL-cholesterol. In people with acute coronary syndrome, high-dose atorvastatin treatment may play a plaque-stabilizing role. At high doses, statins have anti-inflammatory effects, incite reduction of the necrotic plaque core, and improve endothelial function, leading to plaque stabilization and, sometimes, plaque regression. There is a similar thought process with using high-dose atorvastatin as a form of secondary thrombotic stroke recurrence prevention. === Pharmacodynamics === The liver is the primary site of action of atorvastatin, as this is the principal site of both cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. It is the dosage of atorvastatin, rather than systemic medication concentration, which correlates with extent of LDL-C reduction. In a Cochrane systematic review the dose-related magnitude of atorvastatin on blood lipids was determined. Over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/day total cholesterol was reduced by 27.0% to 37.9%, LDL cholesterol by 37.1% to 51.7% and triglycerides by 18.0% to 28.3%. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Atorvastatin undergoes rapid absorption when taken orally, with an approximate time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 1–2 h. The absolute bioavailability of the medication is about 14%, but the systemic availability for HMG-CoA reductase activity is approximately 30%. Atorvastatin undergoes high intestinal clearance and first-pass metabolism, which is the main cause for the low systemic availability. Administration of atorvastatin with food produces a 25% reduction in Cmax (rate of absorption) and a 9% reduction in AUC (extent of absorption), although food does not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin. Evening dose administration is known to reduce the Cmax and AUC by 30% each. However, time of administration does not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin. === Distribution === The mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 L. It is highly protein bound (≥98%), and studies have shown it is likely secreted in human breastmilk. === Metabolism === Atorvastatin metabolism is primarily through cytochrome P450 3A4 hydroxylation to form active ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites, as well as various beta-oxidation metabolites. The ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites are responsible for 70% of systemic HMG-CoA reductase activity. The ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further metabolism via glucuronidation. As a substrate for the CYP3A4 isozyme, it has shown susceptibility to inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 to produce increased or decreased plasma concentrations, respectively. This interaction was tested in vitro with concurrent administration of erythromycin, a known CYP3A4 isozyme inhibitor, which resulted in increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. It is also an inhibitor of cytochrome 3A4. === Excretion === Atorvastatin is primarily eliminated via hepatic biliary excretion, with less than 2% recovered in the urine. Bile elimination follows hepatic and/or extrahepatic metabolism. There does not appear to be any entero-hepatic recirculation. Atorvastatin has an approximate elimination half-life of 14 hours. Noteworthy, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity appears to have a half-life of 20–30 hours, which is thought to be due to the active metabolites. Atorvastatin is also a substrate of the intestinal P-glycoprotein efflux transporter, which pumps the medication back into the intestinal lumen during medication absorption. In hepatic insufficiency, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are significantly affected by concurrent liver disease. People with Child-Pugh Stage A liver disease show a four-fold increase in both Cmax and AUC. People with Child Pugh stage B liver disease show a 16-fold increase in Cmax and an 11-fold increase in AUC. Geriatric people (>65 years old) exhibit altered pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin compared to young adults, with mean AUC and Cmax values that are 40% and 30% higher, respectively. Additionally, healthy elderly people show a greater pharmacodynamic response to atorvastatin at any dose; therefore, this population may have lower effective doses. == Pharmacogenetics == Several genetic polymorphisms may be linked to an increase in statin-related side effects with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLCO1B1 gene showing a 45 fold higher incidence of statin related myopathy than people without the polymorphism. There are several studies showing genetic variants and variable response to atorvastatin. The polymorphisms that showed genome wide significance in Caucasian population were the SNPs in the apoE region; rs445925, rs7412, rs429358 and rs4420638 which showed variable LDL-c response depending on the genotype when treated with atorvastatin. Another genetic variant that showed genome wide significance in Caucasians was the SNP rs10455872 in the LPA gene that lead to higher Lp(a) levels which cause an apparent lower LDL-c response to atorvastatin. These studies were in Caucasian population, more research with a large cohort need to be conducted in different ethnicities to identify more polymorphisms that can affect atorvastatin pharmacokinetics and treatment response. == Chemical synthesis == The first synthesis of atorvastatin at Parke-Davis that occurred during drug discovery was racemic followed by chiral chromatographic separation of the enantiomers. An early enantioselective route to atorvastatin made use of an ester chiral auxiliary to set the stereochemistry of the first of the two alcohol functional groups via a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Once the compound entered pre-clinical development, process chemistry developed a cost-effective and scalable synthesis. In atorvastatin's case, a key element of the overall synthesis was ensuring stereochemical purity in the final drug substance, and hence establishing the first stereocenter became a key aspect of the overall design. The final commercial production of atorvastatin relied on a chiral pool approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of isoascorbic acid, an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product. The atorvastatin calcium complex involves two atorvastatin ions, one calcium ion and three water molecules. == History == Bruce Roth, who was hired by Warner-Lambert as a chemist in 1982, had synthesized an ""experimental compound"" codenamed CI 981 – later called atorvastatin. It was first made in August 1985. Warner-Lambert management was concerned that atorvastatin was a me-too version of rival Merck & Co.'s orphan drug lovastatin (brand name Mevacor). Mevacor, which was first marketed in 1987, was the industry's first statin and Merck's synthetic version – simvastatin – was in the advanced stages of development. Nevertheless, Bruce Roth and his bosses, Roger Newton and Ronald Cresswell, in 1985, convinced company executives to move the compound into expensive clinical trials. Early results comparing atorvastatin to simvastatin demonstrated that atorvastatin appeared more potent and with fewer side effects. In 1994, the findings of a Merck-funded study were published in The Lancet concluding the efficacy of statins in lowering cholesterol proving for the first time not only that a ""statin reduced 'bad' LDL cholesterol but also that it led to a sharp drop in fatal heart attacks among people with heart disease."" In 1996, Warner-Lambert entered into a co-marketing agreement with Pfizer to sell Lipitor, and in 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert for $90.2 billion. Lipitor was on the market by 1996. By 2003, Lipitor had become the best selling pharmaceutical in the United States. From 1996 to 2012, under the trade name Lipitor, atorvastatin became the world's best-selling medication of all time, with more than $125 billion in sales over approximately 14.5 years. and $13 billion a year at its peak, Lipitor alone ""provided up to a quarter of Pfizer Inc.'s annual revenue for years."" Pfizer's patent on atorvastatin expired in November 2011. == Society and culture == === Economics === Atorvastatin is relatively inexpensive. Under provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the United States, health plans may cover the costs of atorvastatin 10 mg and 20 mg for adults aged 40–75 years based on United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. Some plans only cover other statins. === Brand names === Atorvastatin calcium tablets are sold under the brand name Lipitor. Pfizer also packages the medication in combination with other medications, such as atorvastatin/amlodipine. Pfizer's U.S. patent on Lipitor expired on 30 November 2011. Initially, generic atorvastatin was manufactured only by Watson Pharmaceuticals and India's Ranbaxy Laboratories. Prices for the generic version did not drop to the level of other generics—$10 or less for a month's supply—until other manufacturers began to supply the medication in May 2012. In other countries, atorvastatin calcium is made in tablet form by generic medication makers under various brand names including Atoris, Atorlip, Atorva, Atorvastatin Teva, Atorvastatina Parke-Davis, Avas, Cardyl, Liprimar, Litorva, Mactor, Orbeos, Prevencor, Sortis, Stator, Tahor, Torid, Torvacard, Torvast, Totalip, Tulip, Xarator, and Zarator. Pfizer also makes its own generic version under the name Zarator. In the US, Lipitor is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. === Medication recalls === On 9 November 2012, Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. voluntarily recalled 10-, 20- and 40-mg doses of its generic version of atorvastatin in the United States. The lots of atorvastatin, packaged in bottles of 90 and 500 tablets, were recalled due to possible contamination with very small glass particles similar to the size of a grain of sand (less than 1 mm in size). The FDA received no reports of injury from the contamination. Ranbaxy also issued recalls of bottles of 10-milligram tablets in August 2012 and March 2014, due to concerns that the bottles might contain larger, 20-milligram tablets and thus cause potential dosing errors. == References == == Further reading =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}

402	Glycyl-l-leucine	PUBMED	 The uptake of the peptide glycyl-L-leucine across the brush border of the rat small intestinal enterocyte was studied using everted rings. The transfer of leucine from the dipeptide into the enterocyte was greater than the glycine uptake from glycyl-L-leucine. This additional component for leucine transport was found to be abolished by the removal of sodium, by the presence of 10 mM L-alanine beta-naphthylamide, and by excess free leucine. In contrast, the uptake of glycine from glycyl-L-leucine was not sodium-dependent and was not reduced by the presence of excess free leucine. The presence of harmaline over a concentration range up to 10 mM inhibited some of the peptide-bound leucine and glycine uptake. Transport of leucine from glycyl-L-leucine in the presence of 20 mM free leucine was competitively inhibited by glycyl-L-proline, although not completely. It is concluded that, in the rat, the sodium-sensitive component of amino acid uptake from the dipeptide represents free amino acid liberated by superficial hydrolysis, while the transport of the intact peptide is not sodium dependent. In addition, it appears that there are at least two routes of entry for the intact dipeptide glycyl-L-leucine, only one of which is shared with glycyl-L-proline. 1. Characteristics of glycyl-L-leucine influx across the mucosal border of isolated guinea-pig ileum have been investigated. The influx of the peptide was measured with glycine-labelled or leucine-labelled compounds (Gly*-Leu or Gly-Leu*) and compared with that of a constituent amino acids under various experimental conditions 2. Gly-Leu* influx over a wide range of peptide concentrations. The latter obeyed simple Michaelis--Menten kinetics whereas the former could be described in terms of two saturable components. 3. Total replacement of medium Na with mannitol had no effect on Gly*-Leu influx, while it markedly reduced Gly-Leu* influx to a level slightly greater than Gly*-Leu influx. L-Leucine influx was partially dependent on Na in contrast to glycine influx which was absolutely dependent on Na. 4. Gly*-Leu influx was not inhibited by the simultaneous presence of glycine or L-isoleucine, while Gly-Leu* influx was strongly inhibited by L-leucine and L-isoleucine. Gly-Leu* influx under submaximal inhibition by L-isoleucine was about the same as Gly*-Leu influx. Di- or tri-glycine did not inhibit glycyl-L-leucine influx, while glycyl-L-leucine markedly inhibited diglycine influx, the inhibition being not competitive but of the mixed type. 5. A Michaelis--Menten type relation was observed for the increment in the transmural potential induced by glycyl-L-leucine, L-leucine or the mixture of the dipeptide and L-leucine. In all cases, the values of the maximum potential change were identical, suggesting that a single electrogenic transfer mechanism was operating in these cases. 6. It is concluded that about a half of glycyl-L-leucine influx is mediated by a carrier system for intact glycyl-L-leucine which is independent of sodium, and the other half is transported as L-leucine after membrane surface hydrolysis, part of this component being sodium-dependent and electrogenic. It is also suggested that the carrier sites for glycyl-L-leucine and glycylglycine are very closely located but separated. Two dipeptides, glycyl-L-leucine (G-L) and L-leucyl-glycine (L-G), the concentrations of which were 10 mmol/L, were degraded in subcritical water in order to understand fully the phenomena occurring during treatment. Treatment was administered in a stainless steel tubular reactor, which was connected to an HPLC pump and immersed in an oil bath at 200-240 °C, with residence times of 10-180 s. When G-L and L-G were treated, L-G and G-L significantly formed, respectively, and then they gradually decreased at every temperature. Irrespective of the kind of substrate, ring formation occurred, and cyclo-(glycyl-L-leucine) was one of the final products. The reaction rate constants related to degradation were estimated under the assumption that all the reactions obeyed first-order kinetics, and the simulated results corresponded well with the experimental ones in every case.

403	Ser-leu	PUBMED	 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a growth factor composed of 53 amino acids (6.2 kDa), and it is secreted by ectodermic cells, monocytes, kidneys, and duodenal glands (1). EGF stimulates growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF and at least seven other growth factors and their transmembrane receptor kinases play important roles in cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. The EGF receptor (EGFR) family consists of four transmembrane receptors: EGFR (HER1/erbB-1), HER2 (erbB-2/neu), HER3 (erbB-3), and HER4 (erbB-4) (2). HER1, HER3, and HER4 comprise three major functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. No ligand has been clearly identified for HER2; however, HER2 can be activated as a result of ligand binding to other HER receptors with the formation of receptor homodimers and/or heterodimers (3). HER1 and HER2 are overexpressed on many solid tumor cells, such as breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, and colon cancers (4-6). The high levels of HER1 and HER2 expression on cancer cells are associated with a poor prognosis because high levels are related to increased proliferation (7-10).

The high levels of HER1 and HER2 expression on cancer cells are associated with a poor prognosis because high levels are related to increased proliferation (7-10). Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) are known to play a role in the neoplastic transformation of cells (1). The EGFR is a tyrosine kinase receptor family that includes four members, EGFR and three other human EGF receptors (HERs) designated as HER2/ErbB2, HER3/ErbB3, and HER4/ErbB4. The four receptors constitute the HER-kinase axis and regulate cellular responses through complex receptor–ligand interactions. The various signal transduction pathways that respond to EGFR activation and mediate cell responses have been described by Brandt et al. (2). The various EGFRs are known to be amplified, mutated, or overexpressed in several cancers and are a target for the development of pharmaceutical agents that inhibit either the receptor or the signal transduction pathway (3). It has also been reported that the detection of circulating ErbB2-positive tumor cells indicates a poor prognosis for the cancer patient (4). A variety of inhibitors, including small molecules, antibodies, vaccines, and gene therapies, have been developed and tested against the EGFRs for the treatment of cancer (5, 6). However, to achieve therapeutic effects the receptor or signal transduction pathway must be involved in maintenance of the malignant phenotype because HER inhibitor therapy does not necessarily result in treatment of a cancer (7). The use of antibodies alone against EGFR (e.g., cetuximab) and ErbB2 (e.g., trastuzumab) for the treatment of cancer has yielded only moderate results, and it has been observed that antibodies are most useful when used in combination with chemotherapy (8). In some cases cardiotoxicity has been reported in individuals treated with trastuzumab in combination with some chemotherapeutic agents (9). In an effort to develop better and safer anti-cancer drugs, investigators have attempted to use peptides that bind to receptors on tumors to treat the disease (10, 11). The development of peptide pharmaceuticals has also been pursued because, compared to the larger biomolecules such as antibodies, these molecules are easier to synthesize and have low immunogenicity, rapid blood clearance, and a higher uptake in tumor tissue (12). Using bacteriophage technology, a peptide of six amino acids, lys-cys-cys-tyr-ser-leu (KCCYSL), that specifically recognizes and binds the extracellular domain of ErbB2 was identified, and the investigators hypothesized that the peptide could be developed into an imaging and therapeutic agent against cancer cells that overexpress ErbB2 (13). As an extension to the earlier study, the tumor imaging and targeting ability of KCCYSL was evaluated after labeling with radioactive indium (	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.17602609}
406	Tyrosylleucine	PUBMED	 Depression is a worldwide health problem. In the present study, we found that a dipeptide, tyrosyl leucine (Tyr-Leu, YL), administered orally, intracerebroventricularly, or intraperitoneally exhibited a potent antidepressant-like activity in the forced swim and tail suspension tests in naïve mice. YL increased the amount of cells expressing c-Fos, a marker for neuronal activity, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. YL increased bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive cells and doublecortin expression in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, suggesting that YL enhanced the proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro. YL did not affect hippocampal mRNA and protein expression of BDNF, which is a regulatory factor of both neurogenesis and depression-like behavior. Intriguingly, YL suppressed activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis by forced swim stress. Moreover, other aromatic amino acid-leucines, Phe-Leu and Trp-Leu, also exhibited antidepressant-like activities, suggesting that the structure of aromatic amino acid-leucine may be important for antidepressant activity. In addition, bovine milk casein-derived peptide, Tyr-Leu-Gly (YLG), an anxiolytic peptide, exhibited an antidepressant-like activity. Our findings demonstrate that YL exhibits an antidepressant-like effect, moderates the stress response, and induces hippocampal neuronal proliferation through a signal pathway independent of BDNF.

422	Alismol	PUBMED	 Since the ethanol extract of  Microglia activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases by producing neurotoxic factors, such as proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO); therefore, suppression of microglia activation is a potential therapeutic approach against these diseases. Previous study showed that alismol, a sesquiterpenoid isolated from the roots of Vladimiria souliei inhibits interferon-γ-induced NO production in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells. In the present study, we found that alismol reduced NO and prostaglandin E We examined the inhibitory effects of alismol, a sesquiterpenoid isolated from Alismatis Rhizoma, on vascular contractions induced by high concentrations of K+ and Ca2+, and on 45Ca2+ retention in normal and in high K+-containing medium. Alismol affected neither the resting tension nor the 45Ca2+ retention in normal medium, but it inhibited sustained contraction and increased 45Ca2+ retention induced by high K+ concentrations. Alismol did not affect norepinephrine-induced contractions in normal medium, nor phasic contractions in Ca2+-free medium. These results suggested that alismol inhibited mainly Ca2+ influx through a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.12284137}
427	Capsaicin	WIKIPEDIA	"Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) ( or ) is an active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging to the genus Capsicum. It is a potent irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related amides (capsaicinoids) are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, likely as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi. Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic, colorless, highly pungent (i.e., spicy) crystalline solid. == Natural function == Capsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes and, to a lesser extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus Capsicum. The seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith of the inner wall, where the seeds are attached. The seeds of Capsicum plants are dispersed predominantly by birds. In birds, the TRPV1 channel does not respond to capsaicin or related chemicals but mammalian TRPV1 is very sensitive to it. This is advantageous to the plant, as chili pepper seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and can germinate later, whereas mammals have molar teeth which destroy such seeds and prevent them from germinating. Thus, natural selection may have led to increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it disperse. There is also evidence that capsaicin may have evolved as an anti-fungal agent. The fungal pathogen Fusarium, which is known to infect wild chilies and thereby reduce seed viability, is deterred by capsaicin, which thus limits this form of predispersal seed mortality. The vanillotoxin-containing venom of a certain tarantula species (Psalmopoeus cambridgei) activates the same pathway of pain as is activated by capsaicin, an example of a shared pathway in both plant and animal anti-mammalian defense. == Uses == === Food === Because of the burning sensation caused by capsaicin when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, it is commonly used in food products to provide added spiciness or ""heat"" (piquancy), usually in the form of spices such as chili powder and paprika. In high concentrations, capsaicin will also cause a burning effect on other sensitive areas, such as skin or eyes. The degree of heat found within a food is often measured on the Scoville scale. There has long been a demand for capsaicin-spiced products like chili pepper, and hot sauces such as Tabasco sauce and Mexican salsa. It is common for people to experience pleasurable and even euphoric effects from ingesting capsaicin. Folklore among self-described ""chiliheads"" attribute this to pain-stimulated release of endorphins, a different mechanism from the local receptor overload that makes capsaicin effective as a topical analgesic. === Research and pharmaceutical use === Capsaicin is used as an analgesic in topical ointments and dermal patches to relieve pain, typically in concentrations between 0.025% and 0.1%. It may be applied in cream form for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with arthritis, backache, strains and sprains, often in compounds with other rubefacients. It is also used to reduce the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as post-herpetic neuralgia caused by shingles. A capsaicin transdermal patch (Qutenza) for the management of this particular therapeutic indication (pain due to post-herpetic neuralgia) was approved in 2009, as a therapeutic by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Union. A subsequent application to the FDA for Qutenza to be used as an analgesic in HIV neuralgia was refused. One 2017 review of clinical studies having limited quality found that high-dose topical capsaicin (8%) compared with control (0.4% capsaicin) provided moderate to substantial pain relief from post-herpetic neuralgia, HIV-neuropathy, and diabetic neuropathy. Although capsaicin creams have been used to treat psoriasis for reduction of itching, a review of six clinical trials involving topical capsaicin for treatment of pruritus concluded there was insufficient evidence of effect. Oral capsaicin decreases LDL cholesterol levels moderately. There is insufficient clinical evidence to determine the role of ingested capsaicin on several human disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. === Pepper spray and pests === Capsaicinoids are also an active ingredient in riot control and personal defense pepper spray agents. When the spray comes in contact with skin, especially eyes or mucous membranes, it produces pain and breathing difficulty in the affected individual. Capsaicin is also used to deter pests, specifically mammalian pests. Targets of capsaicin repellants include voles, deer, rabbits, squirrels, bears, insects, and attacking dogs. Ground or crushed dried chili pods may be used in birdseed to deter rodents, taking advantage of the insensitivity of birds to capsaicin. The Elephant Pepper Development Trust claims that using chili peppers as a barrier crop can be a sustainable means for rural African farmers to deter elephants from eating their crops. An article published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Health Part B in 2006 states that ""Although hot chili pepper extract is commonly used as a component of household and garden insect-repellent formulas, it is not clear that the capsaicinoid elements of the extract are responsible for its repellency."" The first pesticide product using solely capsaicin as the active ingredient was registered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1962. === Equestrian sports === Capsaicin is a banned substance in equestrian sports because of its hypersensitizing and pain-relieving properties. At the show jumping events of the 2008 Summer Olympics, four horses tested positive for capsaicin, which resulted in disqualification. == Irritant effects == === Acute health effects === Capsaicin is a strong irritant requiring proper protective goggles, respirators, and proper hazardous material-handling procedures. Capsaicin takes effect upon skin contact (irritant, sensitizer), eye contact (irritant), ingestion, and inhalation (lung irritant, lung sensitizer). The LD50 in mice is 47.2 mg/kg. Painful exposures to capsaicin-containing peppers are among the most common plant-related exposures presented to poison centers. They cause burning or stinging pain to the skin and, if ingested in large amounts by adults or small amounts by children, can produce nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and burning diarrhea. Eye exposure produces intense tearing, pain, conjunctivitis, and blepharospasm. === Treatment after exposure === The primary treatment is removal of the offending substance. Plain water is ineffective at removing capsaicin. Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items. When capsaicin is ingested, cold milk may be an effective way to relieve the burning sensation due to caseins in milk, and the water of milk acts as a surfactant, allowing the capsaicin to form an emulsion with it. === Weight loss and regain === As of 2007, there was no evidence showing that weight loss is directly correlated with ingesting capsaicin. Well-designed clinical research had not been performed because the pungency of capsaicin in prescribed doses under research prevented subjects from complying in the study. A 2014 meta-analysis of further trials found weak evidence that consuming capsaicin before a meal might slightly reduce the amount of food consumed, and might drive food preference toward carbohydrates. === Peptic ulcer === One 2006 review concluded that capsaicin may relieve symptoms of a peptic ulcer rather than being a cause of it. === Death === Ingestion of high quantities of capsaicin can be deadly, particularly in people with heart problems. Even healthy young people can suffer adverse health effects like myocardial infarction after ingestion of capsaicin capsules. == Mechanism of action == The burning and painful sensations associated with capsaicin result from ""defunctionalization"" of nociceptor nerve fibers by causing a topical hypersensitivity reaction in the skin. As a member of the vanilloid family, capsaicin binds to a receptor on nociceptor fibers called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1). TRPV1, which can also be stimulated with heat, protons and physical abrasion, permits cations to pass through the cell membrane when activated. The resulting depolarization of the neuron stimulates it to send impulses to the brain. By binding to TRPV1 receptors, capsaicin produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, such as warming, tingling, itching, or stinging, explaining why capsaicin is described as an irritant on the skin and eyes or by ingestion. Clarifying the mechanisms of capsaicin effects on skin nociceptors was part of awarding the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, as it led to the discovery of skin sensors for temperature and touch, and identification of the single gene causing sensitivity to capsaicin. == History == The compound was first extracted in impure form in 1816 by Christian Friedrich Bucholz (1770–1818). In 1873 German pharmacologist Rudolf Buchheim (1820–1879) and in 1878 the Hungarian doctor Endre Hőgyes stated that ""capsicol"" (partially purified capsaicin) caused the burning feeling when in contact with mucous membranes and increased secretion of gastric acid. == Capsaicinoids == The most commonly occurring capsaicinoids are capsaicin (69%), dihydrocapsaicin (22%), nordihydrocapsaicin (7%), homocapsaicin (1%), and homodihydrocapsaicin (1%). Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin (both 16.0 million SHU) are the most pungent capsaicinoids. Nordihydrocapsaicin (9.1 million SHU), homocapsaicin and homodihydrocapsaicin (both 8.6 million SHU) are about half as hot. There are six natural capsaicinoids (table below). Although vanillylamide of n-nonanoic acid (Nonivamide, VNA, also PAVA) is produced synthetically for most applications, it does occur naturally in Capsicum species. == Biosynthesis == === History === The general biosynthetic pathway of capsaicin and other capsaicinoids was elucidated in the 1960s by Bennett and Kirby, and Leete and Louden. Radiolabeling studies identified phenylalanine and valine as the precursors to capsaicin. Enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and their function in capsaicinoid biosynthesis were identified later by Fujiwake et al., and Sukrasno and Yeoman. Suzuki et al. are responsible for identifying leucine as another precursor to the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. It was discovered in 1999 that pungency of chili peppers is related to higher transcription levels of key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase. Similar studies showed high transcription levels in the placenta of chili peppers with high pungency of genes responsible for branched-chain fatty acid pathway. === Biosynthetic pathway === Plants exclusively of the genus Capsicum produce capsaicinoids, which are alkaloids. Capsaicin is believed to be synthesized in the interlocular septum of chili peppers and depends on the gene AT3, which resides at the pun1 locus, and which encodes a putative acyltransferase. Biosynthesis of the capsaicinoids occurs in the glands of the pepper fruit where capsaicin synthase condenses vanillylamine from the phenylpropanoid pathway with an acyl-CoA moiety produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. Capsaicin is the most abundant capsaicinoid found in the genus Capsicum, but at least ten other capsaicinoid variants exist. Phenylalanine supplies the precursor to the phenylpropanoid pathway while leucine or valine provide the precursor for the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. To produce capsaicin, 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-CoA is produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway and condensed with vanillylamine. Other capsaicinoids are produced by the condensation of vanillylamine with various acyl-CoA products from the branched-chain fatty acid pathway, which is capable of producing a variety of acyl-CoA moieties of different chain length and degrees of unsaturation. All condensation reactions between the products of the phenylpropanoid and branched-chain fatty acid pathway are mediated by capsaicin synthase to produce the final capsaicinoid product. == Evolution == The Capsicum genus split from Solanaceae 19.6 million years ago, 5.4 million years after the appearance of Solanaceae, and is native only to the Americas. Chilies only started to quickly evolve in the past 2 million years into markedly different species. This evolution can be partially attributed to a key compound found in peppers, 8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide, otherwise known as capsaicin. Capsaicin evolved similarly across species of chilies that produce capsaicin. Its evolution over the course of centuries is due to genetic drift and natural selection, across the genus Capsicum. Despite the fact that chilies within the Capsicum genus are found in diverse environments, the capsaicin found within them all exhibit similar properties that serve as defensive and adaptive features. Capsaicin evolved to preserve the fitness of peppers against fungi infections, insects, and granivorous mammals. === Antifungal properties === Capsaicin acts as an antifungal agent in four primary ways. First, capsaicin inhibits the metabolic rate of the cells that make up the fungal biofilm. This inhibits the area and growth rate of the fungus, since the biofilm creates an area where a fungus can grow and adhere to the chili in which capsaicin is present. Capsaicin also inhibits fungal hyphae formation, which impacts the amount of nutrients that the rest of the fungal body can receive. Thirdly, capsaicin disrupts the structure of fungal cells and the fungal cell membranes. This has consequential negative impacts on the integrity of fungal cells and their ability to survive and proliferate. Additionally, the ergosterol synthesis of growing fungi decreases in relation to the amount of capsaicin present in the growth area. This impacts the fungal cell membrane, and how it is able to reproduce and adapt to stressors in its environment. === Insecticidal properties === Capsaicin deters insects in multiple ways. The first is by deterring insects from laying their eggs on the pepper due to the effects capsaicin has on these insects. Capsaicin can cause intestinal dysplasia upon ingestion, disrupting insect metabolism and causing damage to cell membranes within the insect. This in turn disrupts the standard feeding response of insects. === Seed dispersion and deterrents against granivorous mammals === Granivorous mammals pose a risk to the propagation of chilies because their molars grind the seeds of chilies, rendering them unable to grow into new chili plants. As a result, modern chilies evolved defense mechanisms to mitigate the risk of granivorous mammals. While capsaicin is present at some level in every part of the pepper, the chemical has its highest concentration in the tissue near the seeds within chilies. Birds are able to eat chilies, then disperse the seeds in their excrement, enabling propagation. === Adaptation to varying moisture levels === Capsaicin is a potent defense mechanism for chilies, but it does come at a cost. Varying levels of capsaicin in chilies currently appear to be caused by an evolutionary split between surviving in dry environments, and having defense mechanisms against fungal growth, insects, and granivorous mammals. Capsaicin synthesis in chilies places a strain on their water resources. This directly affects their fitness, as it has been observed that standard concentration of capsaicin of peppers in high moisture environments in the seeds and pericarps of the peppers reduced the seeds production by 50%. == See also == Allicin, the active piquant flavor chemical in uncooked garlic, and to a lesser extent onions (see those articles for discussion of other chemicals in them relating to pungency, and eye irritation) Capsazepine, capsaicin antagonist Iodoresiniferatoxin, an ultrapotent capsaicin antagonist derived from Resiniferatoxin Naga Viper pepper, Bhut Jolokia Pepper, Carolina Reaper, Trinidad Moruga Scorpion; some of the world's most capsaicin-rich fruits Piperine the active flavor chemical in black pepper List of capsaicinoids == References == === Notes === == Further reading == == External links == Capsaicin General Fact Sheet – National Pesticide Information Center Fire and Spice: The molecular basis for flavor"	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.20492966, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' FOOD': -0.00035286226}
434	Val-pro	PUBMED	 The objective of this study was to explore the molecular targets and mechanism of Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) on regulating glucose metabolism in hepatic cells and their in vivo hypoglycemic activities in mice. Results showed that both IPP and VPP (600 μM) significantly enhanced the glucose consumption in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes ( In this study, we synthesized a polypeptide from its pentapeptide unit using microwave irradiation. Effective methods for polypeptide synthesis from unit peptides have not been reported. Here, we used a key elastin peptide, H-GlyValGlyValPro-OH (GVGVP), as the monomer peptide. It is difficult to obtain poly(Gly-Val-Gly-Val-Pro) (poly(GVGVP)) from the pentapeptide unit of elastin, GVGVP, via polycondensation. Poly(GVGVP) prepared from genetically recombinant Escherichia coli is a well-known temperature-sensitive polypeptide, and this temperature sensitivity is known as the lower critical solution temperature. When microwave irradiation was performed in the presence of various additives, the pentapeptide (GVGVP) polycondensation reaction proceeded smoothly, resulting in a product with a high molecular weight in a relatively good yield. The reaction conditions, like microwave irradiation, coupling agents, and solvents, were optimized to increase the reaction efficiency. The product exhibited a molecular weight greater than Mr 7000. Further, the product could be synthesized on a gram scale. The synthesized polypeptide exhibited a temperature sensitivity that was similar to that of poly(GVGVP) prepared from genetically recombinant E. coli. Therefore, this technique offers a facile and quick approach to prepare polypeptides in large amounts. Copyright © 2016 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

435	Val-trp	PUBMED	 Hypertension is a significant risk factor for various diseases, especially heart, brain, and kidney diseases. It is known that many peptides have the property of lowering blood pressure and determine as ACE inhibitors. The purpose of this study is to obtain information about the molecular structure of Val-Trp (L-valyl-L-tryptophan), which is one of the antihypertensive peptides, by molecular mechanical, quantum mechanical, and spectroscopic methods (FT-IR and Raman). Also, it is aimed to investigate the interactions of Val-Trp dipeptide with receptors related to hypertension and to determine the pharmacokinetic profile due to the potential of the peptide to be a drug candidate. The peptide structure was optimized by DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) basis set, then vibrational wavenumbers, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), HOMO-LUMO (highest occupied molecular orbital- lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), NBO (natural bond orbital) analyzes were performed. The assignment of fundamental theoretical vibration wavenumbers was carried out with potential energy distribution analysis (PED). After the structural analyzes of the peptide were performed, the interactions of the peptide with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Angiotensin II Receptor Type 1 (AT1R) and Renin were investigated by molecular docking study. Then, the molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of the peptide-ACE complex with the best binding affinity in the molecular docking studies was carried out for 50 ns. ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) analysis of Val-Trp dipeptide was performed. In support of the studies carried out, enlightening information about the feasibility of the antihypertensive drug of Val-Trp dipeptide with the help of the ADME profile was presented to the literature.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

441	Montelukast	WIKIPEDIA	"Montelukast, sold under the brand name Singulair among others, is a medication used in the maintenance treatment of asthma. It is generally less preferred for this use than inhaled corticosteroids. It is not useful for acute asthma attacks. Other uses include allergic rhinitis and hives of long duration. For allergic rhinitis it is a second-line treatment. Common side effects include abdominal pain, cough, and headache. Severe side effects may include allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis and eosinophilia. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Montelukast is in the leukotriene receptor antagonist family of medications. It works by blocking the action of leukotriene D4 in the lungs resulting in decreased inflammation and relaxation of smooth muscle. Montelukast was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the seventeenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 29 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Montelukast is used for a number of conditions including asthma, exercise induced bronchospasm, allergic rhinitis, and urticaria. It is mainly used as a complementary therapy in adults in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, if inhaled steroids alone do not bring the desired effect. It is also used to prevent allergic reactions and asthma flare-ups during the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin. It may also be used as an adjunct therapy in symptomatic treatment of mastocytosis. It is taken by mouth, as a tablet, chewable tablet, or as granules. == Pharmacology == Montelukast is in the leukotriene receptor antagonist family of medications. It works by blocking the action of leukotriene D4 in the lungs resulting in decreased inflammation and relaxation of smooth muscle. Montelukast functions as a leukotriene receptor antagonist (cysteinyl leukotriene receptors) and consequently opposes the function of these inflammatory mediators; leukotrienes are produced by the immune system and serve to promote bronchoconstriction, inflammation, microvascular permeability, and mucus secretion in asthma and COPD. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mild rashes, asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes, and fever. Uncommon side effects include fatigue and malaise, behavioral changes, paresthesias and seizures, muscle cramps, and nose bleeds. Rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people taking montelukast) but serious side effects include behavioral changes (including suicidal thoughts), angioedema, erythema multiforme, and liver problems. In 2019 and 2020, concerns for neuropsychiatric reactions were added to the prescription labels in the United Kingdom and the United States where the most frequently suspected were nightmares, depression, insomnia (may affect between 1 in 100 to 1 in 1,000 people taking montelukast); aggression, anxiety and abnormal behavior or changes in behavior (may affect between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 people taking montelukast). === FDA investigation === In June 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded a review into the possibility of neuropsychiatric side effects with leukotriene modulator drugs. Although clinical trials revealed only an increased risk of insomnia, post-marketing surveillance showed that the drugs were associated with a possible increase in suicidal behavior and other side effects such as agitation, aggression, anxiousness, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, depression, irritability, restlessness, and tremor. In March 2020, the FDA required a boxed warning for montelukast to strengthen an existing warning about the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with the drug in the wake of an increase in case reporting of neuropsychiatric events around the time of the initial communications about the concern from FDA in 2008. The boxed warning advises health care providers to avoid prescribing montelukast to patients with mild symptoms, particularly those with allergic rhinitis, because there are many other allergy medicines that can safely and effectively manage this condition. In the FDA's data analysis, in comparison to case reports that based on people's self-reports, the propensity of developing neuropsychiatric disorders after montelukast use did not outpace that of inhaled corticosteroids; and there were no statistically significant risks of new-onset neuropsychiatric disorders among males, females, patients 12 years and older, patients with a psychiatric history, or after the 2008 FDA communication and prescribing information changes that first publicized the concern. In addition, the FDA's analysis summary of its findings said ""exposure to montelukast was significantly associated with a decreased risk of treated outpatient depressive disorder and the decreased risks were seen among patients with a history of a psychiatric disorder, in patients 12 to 17 years as well as 18 years and older, and in both females and males."" ""Treated outpatient depressive disorder"" refers to patients who sought treatment specifically for depressive disorders in outpatient psychiatric settings. In 2024, following reports of night terrors, uncontrollable aggression, intrusive thoughts, depression and rare cases of hallucinations and suicidal behavior in children, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was reviewing the risks of montelukast after identifying ""further concerns"". The FDA has begun, as of 2020, an internal expert review of why the drug may cause ""neuropsychiatric side effects"". In a limited audience review of some findings of this internal group to the American College of Toxicology, on November 20, 2024 in Austin, TX, Jessica Oliphant, deputy director for FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, said ""that laboratory tests showed “significant binding” of montelukast to multiple receptors found in the brain"" and that ""These data indicate that montelukast is highest in brain regions known to be involved in (psychiatric effects),”. The FDA does not plan to update the box warning label. == Drug interactions == Montelukast is an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2C8, part of the cytochrome P450 system. Therefore, it is theoretically possible that the combination of montelukast with a CYP2C8 substrate (e.g. amodiaquine, an anti-malarial drug) could increase the plasma concentrations of the substrate. However, clinical studies have shown minimal interactions between montelukast and other CYP2C8 substrate drugs, which is most likely due to the high plasma protein binding exhibited by montelukast. == Society and culture == === Patents === Singulair was covered by US Patent No. 5,565,473 which expired on 3 August 2012. The same day, the FDA approved several generic versions of montelukast. The United States Patent and Trademark Office launched a reexamination of the patent covering Singulair on May 2009. The decision was driven by the discovery of references that were not included in the original patent application process. The references were submitted through Article One Partners, an online research community focused on finding literature relating to existing patents. The references included a scientific article produced by a Merck employee on the active ingredient in Singulair. A previously filed patent had been submitted in the same technology area. Seven months later the US Patent and Trademark Office determined that the patent in question was valid based on the initial reexamination and new information provided, submitting their decision on 17 December 2009. === Use with loratadine === Schering-Plough and Merck sought permission to market a combined tablet with loratadine and montelukast. However, the FDA has found no benefit from a combined pill for seasonal allergies over taking the two drugs in combination, and in April 2008, issued a not-approvable letter for the combination. === Brand names === The Mont in montelukast stands for Montreal, the place where Merck (MSD) developed the drug. Montelukast is sold under a variety of brand names including Monalast (Ziska Pharmaceuticals Ltd) Montenaaf (NAAFCO Pharma) Montelon-10 (Apex), Montene (Square), Montair-10, Lukotas, Montelo-10, Monteflo, and Tukast L in India, Reversair (ACI Bangladesh), Monas, Miralust, Montiva, Provair, Montril, Lumona, Lumenta, Arokast and Trilock in Bangladesh, Ventair in Nepal, Montika in Pakistan, Montelair in Brazil, Zykast in the Philippines though combined with levocetirizine, Desmont, Levmont, Aircomb and Notta in Turkey, Topraz and Monte-Air in South Africa, AirOn in Venezuela, and AirFast in Saudi Arabia. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
443	Panthenol	WIKIPEDIA	Panthenol (also called pantothenol) is the alcohol analog of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), and is thus a provitamin of B5. In organisms, it is quickly oxidized to pantothenic acid. It is a viscous transparent liquid at room temperature. Panthenol is used in pharmaceutical and children's products as a moisturizer and to hasten wound healing. == Uses == In pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and personal-care products, panthenol is a moisturizer and humectant, used in ointments, lotions, shampoos, nasal sprays, eye drops, lozenges, and cleaning solutions for contact lenses. In ointments it is used for the treatment of sunburns, mild burns, minor skin injuries, and skin disorders (in concentrations of up to 2–5%). It improves hydration, reduces itching and inflammation of the skin, improves skin elasticity, and accelerates epidermal wounds' rate of healing. For this purpose, it is sometimes combined with allantoin. A case study of dexpanthenol application to regenerate bat's dry patagium was reporterd. It binds to the hair shaft readily, due to which it is a common component of commercial shampoos and hair conditioners (in concentrations of 0.1–1%). It coats the hair and seals its surface, lubricating the hair shaft and giving it a shiny appearance. D-panthenol (dexpanthenol) is sometimes used as an ingredient in tattoo aftercare products, with one study finding it can assist in wound care and tattoo preservation. == Adverse effects == Panthenol is generally well tolerated. In rare cases, skin irritation and contact allergies have been reported. == Pharmacology == Panthenol readily penetrates into the skin and mucous membranes (including the intestinal mucosa), where it is quickly oxidized to pantothenic acid. Pantothenic acid is extremely hygroscopic. It is also used in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A, which plays a role in a wide range of enzymatic reactions and in cell growth. == Physical and chemical properties == Panthenol is an odourless, slightly bitter, highly viscous, transparent, and colourless liquid at room temperature, but salts of pantothenic acid (for example sodium pantothenate) are powders that are typically white. It is easily soluble in water and alcohol, moderately soluble in diethyl ether, soluble in chloroform (1:100), in propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in glycerin. Panthenol's expanded chemical formula is HO–CH2–C(CH3)2–CH(OH)–CONH–CH2CH2CH2–OH. === Stereochemistry === Panthenol comes in two enantiomers: D, and L. Only D-panthenol (dexpanthenol) is biologically active, however both forms have moisturizing properties. For cosmetic use, panthenol comes either in D form, or as a racemic mixture of D and L (DL-panthenol). == References ==	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD	{'MED': -0.020331647, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.14622776, ' PERSON': -0.00012106613, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0, ' FOOD': -9.4914985e-06}
444	Pantothenic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is a B vitamin and an essential nutrient. All animals need pantothenic acid in order to synthesize coenzyme A (CoA), which is essential for cellular energy production and for the synthesis and degradation of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Pantothenic acid is the combination of pantoic acid and β-alanine. Its name comes from the Greek πάντοθεν pantothen, meaning ""from everywhere"", because pantothenic acid, at least in small amounts, is in almost all foods. Deficiency of pantothenic acid is very rare in humans. In dietary supplements and animal feed, the form commonly used is calcium pantothenate, because chemically it is more stable, and hence makes for longer product shelf-life, than sodium pantothenate and free pantothenic acid. == Definition == Pantothenic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, one of the B vitamins. It is synthesized from the amino acid β-alanine and pantoic acid (see biosynthesis and structure of coenzyme A figures). Unlike vitamin E or vitamin K, which occurs in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, pantothenic acid is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a cofactor for many enzyme processes. == Use in biosynthesis of coenzyme A == Pantothenic acid is a precursor to CoA via a five-step process. The biosynthesis requires pantothenic acid, cysteine, and four equivalents of ATP (see figure). Pantothenic acid is phosphorylated to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme pantothenate kinase. This is the committed step in CoA biosynthesis and requires ATP. A cysteine is added to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase to form 4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). This step is coupled with ATP hydrolysis. PPC is decarboxylated to 4′-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase 4′-Phosphopantetheine is adenylated (or more properly, AMPylated) to form dephospho-CoA by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase Finally, dephospho-CoA is phosphorylated to coenzyme A by the enzyme dephosphocoenzyme A kinase. This final step also requires ATP. This pathway is suppressed by end-product inhibition, meaning that CoA is a competitive inhibitor of pantothenate kinase, the enzyme responsible for the first step. Coenzyme A is necessary in the reaction mechanism of the citric acid cycle. This process is the body's primary catabolic pathway and is essential in breaking down the building blocks of the cell such as carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids, for fuel. CoA is important in energy metabolism for pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) as acetyl-CoA, and for α-ketoglutarate to be transformed to succinyl-CoA in the cycle. CoA is also required for acylation and acetylation, which, for example, are involved in signal transduction, and various enzyme functions. In addition to functioning as CoA, this compound can act as an acyl group carrier to form acetyl-CoA and other related compounds; this is a way to transport carbon atoms within the cell. CoA is also required in the formation of acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is required for fatty acid synthesis. Its synthesis also connects with other vitamins such as thiamin and folic acid. == Dietary recommendations == The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for B vitamins in 1998. At that time, there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs for pantothenic acid. In instances such as this, the Board sets Adequate Intakes (AIs), with the understanding that at some later date, AIs may be replaced by more exact information. The current AI for teens and adults ages 14 and up is 5 mg/day. This was based in part on the observation that for a typical diet, urinary excretion was approximately 2.6 mg/day, and that bioavailability of food-bound pantothenic acid was roughly 50%. AI for pregnancy is 6 mg/day. AI for lactation is 7 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months, the AI is 1.8 mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years, the AI increases with age from 2 to 4 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). While for many nutrients, the US Department of Agriculture uses food composition data combined with food consumption survey results to estimate average consumption, the surveys and reports do not include pantothenic acid in the analyses. Less formal estimates of adult daily intakes report about 4 to 7 mg/day. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the US. For women and men over age 11, the Adequate Intake (AI) is set at 5 mg/day. AI for pregnancy is 5 mg/day, for lactation 7 mg/day. For children ages 1–10 years, the AI is 4 mg/day. These AIs are similar to the US AIs. === Safety === As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of pantothenic acid, there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. The EFSA also reviewed the safety question and reached the same conclusion as in the United States – that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for pantothenic acid. === Labeling requirements === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For pantothenic acid labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 10 mg, but as of May 2016 it was revised to 5 mg to bring it into agreement with the AI. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by January 2020 for manufacturers with US$10 million or more in annual food sales, and by January 2021 for manufacturers with lower volume food sales. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == === Dietary === Food sources of pantothenic acid include animal-sourced foods, including dairy foods and eggs. Potatoes, tomato products, oat-cereals, sunflower seeds, avocado are good plant sources. Mushrooms are good sources, too. Whole grains are another source of the vitamin, but milling to make white rice or white flour removes much of the pantothenic acid, as it is found in the outer layers of whole grains. In animal feeds, the most important sources are alfalfa, cereal, fish meal, peanut meal, molasses, rice bran, wheat bran, and yeasts. === Supplements === Dietary supplements of pantothenic acid commonly use pantothenol (or panthenol), a shelf-stable analog, which is converted to pantothenic acid once consumed. Calcium pantothenate – a salt – may be used in manufacturing because it is more resistant than pantothenic acid to factors that deteriorate stability, such as acid, alkali or heat. The amount of pantothenic acid in dietary supplement products may contain up to 1,000 mg (200 times the Adequate Intake level for adults), without evidence that such large amounts provide any benefit. According to WebMD, pantothenic acid supplements have a long list of claimed uses, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support any of them. As a dietary supplement, pantothenic acid is not the same as pantethine, which is composed of two pantothenic acid molecules linked by a disulfide bridge. Sold as a high-dose supplement (600 mg), pantethine may be effective for lowering blood levels of LDL cholesterol – a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases – but its long-term effects are unknown, so use should be supervised by a physician. Dietary supplementation with pantothenic acid does not have the cholesterol-lowering effect as pantethine. === Fortification === According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, pantothenic acid deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified. == Absorption, metabolism and excretion == When found in foods, most pantothenic acid is in the form of CoA or bound to acyl carrier protein (ACP). For the intestinal cells to absorb this vitamin, it must be converted into free pantothenic acid. Within the lumen of the intestine, CoA and ACP are hydrolyzed into 4'-phosphopantetheine. The 4'-phosphopantetheine is then dephosphorylated into pantetheine. Pantetheinase, an intestinal enzyme, then hydrolyzes pantetheine into free pantothenic acid. Free pantothenic acid is absorbed into intestinal cells via a saturable, sodium-dependent active transport system. At high levels of intake, when this mechanism is saturated, some pantothenic acid may also be additionally absorbed via passive diffusion. As a whole, when intake increases 10-fold, absorption rate decreases to 10%. Pantothenic acid is excreted in urine. This occurs after its release from CoA. Urinary amounts are on the order of 2.6 mg/day, but decreased to negligible amounts when subjects in multi-week experimental situations were fed diets devoid of the vitamin. == Deficiency == Pantothenic acid deficiency in humans is very rare and has not been thoroughly studied. In the few cases where deficiency has been seen (prisoners of war during World War II, victims of starvation, or limited volunteer trials), nearly all symptoms were reversed with orally administered pantothenic acid. Symptoms of deficiency are similar to other vitamin B deficiencies. There is impaired energy production, due to low CoA levels, which could cause symptoms of irritability, fatigue, and apathy. Acetylcholine synthesis is also impaired; therefore, neurological symptoms can also appear in deficiency; they include sensation of numbness in hands and feet, paresthesia and muscle cramps. Additional symptoms could include restlessness, malaise, sleep disturbances, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. In animals, symptoms include disorders of the nervous, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, reduced growth rate, decreased food intake, skin lesions and changes in hair coat, and alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. In rodents, there can be loss of hair color, which led to marketing of pantothenic acid as a dietary supplement which could prevent or treat graying of hair in humans (despite the lack of any human trial evidence). Pantothenic acid status can be assessed by measuring either whole blood concentration or 24-hour urinary excretion. In humans, whole blood values less than 1 μmol/L are considered low, as is urinary excretion of less than 4.56 mmol/day. == Animal nutrition == Calcium pantothenate and dexpanthenol (D-panthenol) are European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved additives to animal feed. Supplementation is on the order of 8–20 mg/kg for pigs, 10–15 mg/kg for poultry, 30–50 mg/kg for fish and 8–14 mg/kg feed for pets. These are recommended concentrations, designed to be higher than what are thought to be requirements. There is some evidence that feed supplementation increases pantothenic acid concentration in tissues, i.e., meat, consumed by humans, and also for eggs, but this raises no concerns for consumer safety. No dietary requirement for pantothenic acid has been established in ruminant species. Synthesis of pantothenic acid by ruminal microorganisms appears to be 20 to 30 times more than dietary amounts. Net microbial synthesis of pantothenic acid in the rumen of steer calves has been estimated to be 2.2 mg/kg of digestible organic matter consumed per day. Supplementation of pantothenic acid at 5 to 10 times theoretical requirements did not improve growth performance of feedlot cattle. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Bacteria synthesize pantothenic acid from the amino acids aspartate and a precursor to the amino acid valine. Aspartate is converted to β-alanine. The amino group of valine is replaced by a keto-moiety to yield α-ketoisovalerate, which, in turn, forms α-ketopantoate following transfer of a methyl group, then D-pantoate (also known as pantoic acid) following reduction. β-alanine and pantoic acid are then condensed to form pantothenic acid (see figure). === Industrial synthesis === The industrial synthesis of pantothenic acid starts with the aldol condensation of isobutyraldehyde and formaldehyde. The resulting hydroxypivaldehyde is converted to its cyanohydrin derivative. which is cyclised to give racemic pantolactone. This sequence of reactions was first published in 1904. Synthesis of the vitamin is completed by resolution of the lactone using quinine, for example, followed by treatment with the calcium or sodium salt of β-alanine. == History == The term vitamin is derived from the word vitamine, which was coined in 1912 by Polish biochemist Casimir Funk, who isolated a complex of water-soluble micronutrients essential to life, all of which he presumed to be amines. When this presumption was later determined not to be true, the ""e"" was dropped from the name, hence ""vitamin"". Vitamin nomenclature was alphabetical, with Elmer McCollum calling these fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Over time, eight chemically distinct, water-soluble B vitamins were isolated and numbered, with pantothenic acid as vitamin B5. The essential nature of pantothenic acid was discovered by Roger J. Williams in 1933 by showing it was required for the growth of yeast. Three years later Elvehjem and Jukes demonstrated that it was a growth and anti-dermatitis factor in chickens. Williams dubbed the compound ""pantothenic acid"", deriving the name from the Greek word pantothen, which translates as ""from everywhere"". His reason was that he found it to be present in almost every food he tested. Williams went on to determine the chemical structure in 1940. In 1953, Fritz Lipmann shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for his discovery of co-enzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism"", work he had published in 1946. == References =="	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	FOOD, MEDICAL	{'FO': -0.029658033, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -0.017153006, ' MED': -0.01486351, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07}
445	Fexofenadine	WIKIPEDIA	Fexofenadine, sold under the brand name Allegra among others, is an antihistamine pharmaceutical drug used in the treatment of allergy symptoms, such as hay fever and urticaria. Therapeutically, fexofenadine is a selective peripheral H1 blocker. It is classified as a second-generation antihistamine because it is less able to pass the blood–brain barrier and cause sedation, compared to first-generation antihistamines. It was patented in 1979 and came into medical use in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Fexofenadine has been manufactured in generic form since 2011. In 2022, it was the 257th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Fexofenadine is used for relief from physical symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis and for treatment of hives, including chronic urticaria. It does not cure, but rather prevents the aggravation of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, and reduces the severity of the symptoms associated with those conditions, providing relief from repeated sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes or skin, and general body fatigue. In a 2018 review, fexofenadine, along with levocetirizine, desloratadine, and cetirizine, was cited to be a safe drug to use for individuals with inherited long QT syndrome. === Efficacy === For the treatment of allergic rhinitis, fexofenadine is similarly effective to cetirizine, but is associated with less drowsiness than cetirizine. Fexofenadine was also shown to inhibit histamine-induced wheal and flare to a significantly greater degree than loratadine or desloratadine, but was slightly less effective than levocetirizine. Fexofenadine at doses above 120 mg a day does not appear to provide additional efficacy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. == Side effects == The most common side effects include headache, back and muscle pain, miosis or pinpoint pupils, nausea, drowsiness, and menstrual cramps. Anxiety and insomnia have also been rarely reported. The most common side effects demonstrated during clinical trials were cough, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, and otitis media for children ages 6 to 11 and fatigue for children ages 6 months to 5 years. == Overdose == The safety profile of fexofenadine is quite favorable, as no cardiovascular or sedative effects have been shown to occur even when taking 10 times the recommended dose. Research on humans ranges from a single 800-mg dose, to a twice-daily, 690-mg dose for a month, with no clinically significant adverse effects, when compared to a placebo. No deaths occurred in testing on mice, at 5000 mg/kg body weight, which is 110 times the maximum recommended dose for an adult human. If an overdose were to occur, supportive measures are recommended. Theoretically, an overdose could present as dizziness, dry mouth, and/or drowsiness, consistent with an exaggeration of the usual side effects. Hemodialysis does not appear to be an effective means of removing fexofenadine from the blood. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Fexofenadine is a selective peripheral H1 receptor antagonist. Blockage prevents the activation of the H1 receptors by histamine, preventing the symptoms associated with allergies from occurring. Fexofenadine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so is less likely to cause drowsiness in comparison to other antihistamines that readily cross that barrier (i.e., first-generation antihistamines such as diphenhydramine). In general, fexofenadine takes about an hour to take effect, though this may be affected by the choice of dosage form and the presence of certain foods. Fexofenadine also exhibits no anticholinergic, antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, alpha 1-adrenergic, or beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking effects. === Pharmacokinetics === Absorption: After oral application, maximum plasma concentrations are reached after 2–3 hours. Fexofenadine should not be taken with a high-fat meal, as mean concentrations of fexofenadine in the bloodstream are seen to be reduced by 20–60% depending on the form of medication (tablet, ODT, or suspension). Distribution: Fexofenadine is 60–70% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. Metabolism: Fexofenadine is a substrate of CYP3A4, but only about 5% is metabolized by the liver, indicating that hepatic metabolism is relatively minor in clearance from the body. Elimination: Most of the substance is eliminated unchanged via the feces (80%) and urine (11–12%). == Interactions == Taking erythromycin or ketoconazole while taking fexofenadine does increase the plasma levels of fexofenadine, but this increase does not influence the QT interval. The reason for this effect is likely due to transport-related effects, specifically involving p-glycoprotein (p-gp). Both erythromycin and ketoconazole are inhibitors of p-gp, a transporter protein involved in preventing the intestinal absorption of fexofenadine. When p-gp is inhibited, fexofenadine may be better absorbed by the body, increasing its plasma concentration by more than intended. Fexofenadine is not to be taken with apple, orange, or grapefruit juice because they could decrease absorption of the drug. Therefore, it should be taken with water. Grapefruit juice can significantly reduce the plasma concentration of fexofenadine. Antacids containing aluminum or magnesium should not be taken within 15 minutes of fexofenadine, as they reduce its absorption by almost 50%. This is not thought to be due to a change in pH (in fact, absorption can actually increase under increasingly alkaline pH), but rather due to the formation of metal complexes with charged/polar moieties on fexofenadine. As suggested by Shehnaza et al (2014), various sites of the molecule are thought to be responsible for this interaction, including the piperidine nitrogen, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, and both hydroxyl (-OH) groups. == History == The older antihistaminic agent terfenadine was found to metabolize into the related carboxylic acid, fexofenadine. Fexofenadine was found to retain all of the biological activity of its parent while giving fewer adverse reactions in patients, so terfenadine was replaced in the market by its metabolite. Fexofenadine was originally synthesized in 1993 by Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Sepracor, which then sold the development rights to Hoechst Marion Roussel (now part of Sanofi-Aventis), and was later approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996. Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI) holds the patents to the intermediates and production of fexofenadine HCl, along with Roussel. Since that time, it has achieved blockbuster drug status with global sales of US$1.87B in 2004 (with $1.49B coming from the United States). AMRI received royalty payments from Aventis which enabled the growth of AMRI. In January 2011, the FDA approved over-the-counter sales of fexofenadine in the United States, and Sanofi Aventis' version became available in March 2011. In December 2020, the MHRA reclassified fexofenadine from prescription only to allow general sales in the United Kingdom. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Fexofenadine is marketed under many brand names worldwide. As of January 2017, it is marketed as a combination drug with pseudoephedrine under brand names including Alerfedine D, Allegra-D, Allergyna-D, Allevia, Altiva-D, Dellegra, Fexo Plus, Fexofed, Fixal Plus, Ridrinal D, Rinolast D, Telfast D, and Treathay. As of January 2017, it is marketed as a combination drug with montelukast under brand names including Fexokast, Histakind-M, Monten-FX, Montolife-FX, Montair-FX and Novamont-FX. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -6.704273e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
447	Salbutamol	WIKIPEDIA	"Salbutamol, also known as albuterol and sold under the brand name Ventolin among others, is a medication that opens up the medium and large airways in the lungs. It is a short-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist that causes relaxation of airway smooth muscle. It is used to treat asthma, including asthma attacks and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It may also be used to treat high blood potassium levels. Salbutamol is usually used with an inhaler or nebulizer, but it is also available in a pill, liquid, and intravenous solution. Onset of action of the inhaled version is typically within 15 minutes and lasts for two to six hours. Common side effects include shakiness, headache, fast heart rate, dizziness, and feeling anxious. Serious side effects may include worsening bronchospasm, irregular heartbeat, and low blood potassium levels. It can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but safety is not entirely clear. Salbutamol was patented in 1966 in Britain and became commercially available in the UK in 1969. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Salbutamol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the seventh most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 59 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Salbutamol is typically used to treat bronchospasm (due to any cause—allergic asthma or exercise-induced), as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is also one of the most common medicines used in rescue inhalers (short-term bronchodilators to alleviate asthma attacks). As a β2 agonist, salbutamol also has use in obstetrics. Intravenous salbutamol can be used as a tocolytic to relax the uterine smooth muscle to delay premature labor. While preferred over agents such as atosiban and ritodrine, its role has largely been replaced by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, which is more effective and better tolerated. Salbutamol has been used to treat acute hyperkalemia, as it stimulates potassium flow into cells, thus lowering the potassium in the blood. Two recent studies have suggested that salbutamol reduces the symptoms of newborns and adolescents with myasthenia gravis and transient neonatal myasthenia gravis. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects are fine tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and palpitation. Other symptoms may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances of sleep and behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, urticaria (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause hypokalemia, which is of concern especially in patients with kidney failure and those on certain diuretics and xanthine derivatives. Salbutamol metered dose inhalers have been described as the ""single biggest source of carbon emissions from NHS medicines prescribing"" due to the propellants used in the inhalers. Dry powder inhalers are recommended as a low-carbon alternative. == Pharmacology == The tertiary butyl group in salbutamol makes it more selective for β2 receptors, which are the predominant receptors on the bronchial smooth muscles. Activation of these receptors causes adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP, beginning the signalling cascade that ends with the inhibition of myosin phosphorylation and lowering the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (myosin phosphorylation and calcium ions are necessary for muscle contractions). The increase in cAMP also inhibits inflammatory cells in the airway, such as basophils, eosinophils, and most especially mast cells, from releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Salbutamol and other β2 receptor agonists also increase the conductance of channels sensitive to calcium and potassium ions, leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles. Salbutamol is either filtered out by the kidneys directly or is first metabolized into the 4′-O-sulfate, which is excreted in the urine. == Chemistry == Salbutamol is sold as a racemic mixture. The (R)-(−)-enantiomer (CIP nomenclature) is shown in the image at right (top), and is responsible for the pharmacologic activity; the (S)-(+)-enantiomer (bottom) blocks metabolic pathways associated with elimination of itself and of the pharmacologically active enantiomer (R). The slower metabolism of the (S)-(+)-enantiomer also causes it to accumulate in the lungs, which can cause airway hyperreactivity and inflammation. Potential formulation of the R form as an enantiopure drug is complicated by the fact that the stereochemistry is not stable, but rather the compound undergoes racemization within a few days to weeks, depending on pH. The direct separation of Salbutamol enantiomers and the control of enantiomeric purity has been described by thin-layer chromatography. == History == Salbutamol was discovered in 1966, by a research team led by David Jack at the Allen and Hanburys laboratory (now a subsidiary of Glaxo) in Ware, Hertfordshire, England, and was launched as Ventolin in 1969. The 1972 Munich Olympics were the first Olympics where anti-doping measures were deployed, and at that time β2 agonists were considered to be stimulants with high risk of abuse for doping. Inhaled salbutamol was banned from those games, but by 1986 was permitted (although oral β2 agonists were not). After a steep rise in the number of athletes taking β2 agonists for asthma in the 1990s, Olympic athletes were required to provide proof that they had asthma in order to be allowed to use inhaled β2 agonists. In February 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first generic of an albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in people four years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in people four years of age and older. The FDA granted approval of the generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol to Perrigo Pharmaceutical. In April 2020, the FDA approved the first generic of Proventil HFA (albuterol sulfate) metered dose inhaler, 90 μg per inhalation, for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in patients four years of age and older who have reversible obstructive airway disease, as well as the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in this age group. The FDA granted approval of this generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol to Cipla Limited. == Society and culture == In 2020, generic versions were approved in the United States. === Names === Salbutamol is the international nonproprietary name (INN) while albuterol is the United States Adopted Name (USAN). The drug is usually manufactured and distributed as the sulfate salt (salbutamol sulfate). It was first sold by Allen & Hanburys (UK) under the brand name Ventolin, and has been used for the treatment of asthma ever since. The drug is marketed under many names worldwide. === Misuse === Albuterol and other beta-2 adrenergic agonists are used by some recreational bodybuilders. === Doping === As of 2011 there was no evidence that an increase in physical performance occurs after inhaling salbutamol, but there are various reports for benefit when delivered orally or intravenously. In spite of this, salbutamol required ""a declaration of Use in accordance with the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions"" under the 2010 WADA prohibited list. This requirement was relaxed when the 2011 list was published to permit the use of ""salbutamol (maximum 1600 micrograms over 24 hours) and salmeterol when taken by inhalation in accordance with the manufacturers' recommended therapeutic regimen."" Abuse of the drug may be confirmed by detection of its presence in plasma or urine, typically exceeding 1,000 ng/mL. The window of detection for urine testing is on the order of just 24 hours, given the relatively short elimination half-life of the drug, estimated at between 5 and 6 hours following oral administration of 4 mg. == Research == Salbutamol has been studied in subtypes of congenital myasthenic syndrome associated with mutations in Dok-7. It has also been tested in a trial aimed at treatment of spinal muscular atrophy; it is speculated to modulate the alternative splicing of the SMN2 gene, increasing the amount of the SMN protein, the deficiency of which is regarded as a cause of the disease. Albuterol increases energy expenditure by 10-15 percent at a therapeutic dose for asthma and around 25 percent at a higher, oral dose. In several human studies, albuterol increased lean body mass, reduced fat mass, and caused lipolysis; it has been studied for use as an anti-obesity and anti-muscle wasting medication when taken orally. == Veterinary use == Salbutamol's low toxicity makes it safe for other animals and thus is the medication of choice for treating acute airway obstruction in most species. It is usually used to treat bronchospasm or coughs in cats and dogs and used as a bronchodilator in horses with recurrent airway obstruction; it can also be used in emergencies to treat asthmatic cats. Toxic effects require an extremely high dose, and most overdoses are due to dogs chewing on and puncturing an inhaler or nebulizer vial. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
449	Finasteride	WIKIPEDIA	"Finasteride, sold under the brand names Proscar and Propecia among others, is a medication used to treat pattern hair loss and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. It can also be used to treat excessive hair growth in women. It is usually taken orally but there are topical formulations for patients with hair loss, designed to minimize systemic exposure by acting specifically on hair follicles. Finasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor and therefore an antiandrogen. It works by decreasing the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by about 70%. In addition to DHT, finasteride also inhibits the production of several anticonvulsant neurosteroids including allopregnanolone, androstanediol, and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone. Adverse effects from finasteride are rare in men with already enlarged prostates; however, some men experience sexual dysfunction, depression, and breast enlargement. In some men, sexual dysfunction may persist after stopping the medication. It may also hide the early symptoms of certain forms of prostate cancer. Finasteride was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1992. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 73rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Finasteride has been used for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate and for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) in men. === Enlarged prostate === Physicians sometimes prescribe finasteride for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, informally known as an enlarged prostate. Finasteride may improve the symptoms associated with BPH such as difficulty urinating, getting up during the night to urinate, hesitation at the start and end of urination, and decreased urinary flow. The use of the drug showed significant sexual adverse effects such as erectile dysfunction and less sexual desire, in particular when obstructive symptoms due to an enlarged prostate were present. === Scalp hair loss === Finasteride is also used to treat male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) in men, a condition that develops in up to 80% of Caucasian men aged 70 and over. In the United States, finasteride and minoxidil are the only two FDA approved drugs for the treatment of male pattern hair loss as of 2017. Treatment with finasteride slows further hair loss and provides about 30% improvement in hair loss after six months of treatment, with effectiveness persisting as long as the drug is taken. Taking finasteride leads to a reduction in scalp and serum DHT levels; by lowering scalp levels of DHT, finasteride can maintain or increase the amount of terminal hairs in the anagen phase by inhibiting and sometimes reversing miniaturization of the hair follicle. Finasteride is most effective on the crown but can reduce hair loss in all areas of the scalp. Finasteride has also been tested for pattern hair loss in women; however, the results were no better than placebo. Finasteride is less effective in the treatment of scalp hair loss than dutasteride. === Prostate cancer === In males aged 55 years old and over finasteride decreases the risk of low-grade prostate cancer but may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer and has no effect on overall survival. A 2010 review found a 25% reduction in the risk of prostate cancer with 5α-reductase inhibitor. A follow-up study of the Medicare claims of participants in a 10-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial suggests the reduction in prostate cancer is maintained even after discontinuation of treatment. However, 5α-reductase inhibitors have been found to increase the risk of developing certain rare but aggressive forms of prostate cancer (27% risk increase), although not all studies have observed this. No impact of 5-α-reductase inhibitor on survival has been found in people with prostate cancer. === Excessive hair growth === Finasteride has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism (excessive facial and/or body hair growth) in women. In a study of 89 women with hyperandrogenism due to persistent adrenarche syndrome, finasteride produced a 93% reduction in facial hirsutism and a 73% reduction of bodily hirsutism after 2 years of treatment. Other studies using finasteride for hirsutism have also found it to be effective. === Transgender hormone therapy === Finasteride is sometimes used in hormone replacement therapy for transgender women due to its antiandrogenic effects, in combination with a form of estrogen. However, little clinical research of finasteride use for this purpose has been conducted and evidence of safety or efficacy is limited. Moreover, caution has been recommended when prescribing finasteride to transgender women, as finasteride may be associated with side effects such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, symptoms that are particularly prevalent in the transgender population and others at high risk already. == Adverse effects == A 2010 Cochrane review of finasteride for BPH found that, in men with a weighted mean age of 62.4, adverse effects are rare in men with already enlarged prostates; “nevertheless, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder, versus placebo."" As of 2016, fresh evidence suggested such effects, along with disturbed neurosteroid production, may persist after finasteride use is stopped. Finasteride is contraindicated in pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration advises that donation of blood or plasma be deferred for at least one month after taking the last dose of finasteride. The FDA has added a warning to 5α-reductase inhibitors concerning an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, as the treatment of BPH lowers PSA (prostate-specific antigen), which could mask the development of prostate cancer. Although overall incidence of male breast cancer in clinical trials for finasteride 5 mg was not increased, there are post-marketing reports of breast cancer in association with its use, though available evidence does not provide clarity as to whether there is a causative relationship between finasteride and these cancers. A 2018 meta-analysis found no higher risk of breast cancer with 5α-reductase inhibitors. Some men develop gynecomastia (breast development or enlargement) following finasteride usage. The risk of gynecomastia with 5α-reductase inhibitors is low at about 1.5%. Depressive symptoms and suicidality have been reported. === Sexual adverse effects === Use of finasteride is associated with an increased risk of sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculatory dysfunction. Sexual adverse effects of finasteride and dutasteride have been linked to lower quality of life and ability to maintain an intimate relationship, and can cause stress in relationships. The adverse effect profiles of finasteride are somewhat different for its indications of hair loss and BPH. ==== Finasteride for androgenetic alopecia (hair loss in men) ==== The most common adverse effects of finasteride taken for hair loss are a decrease in sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and a decrease in the amount of semen.: 17 In addition, finasteride has been reported in case reports to cause sexual problems that persist after stopping the medication. A 2012 update to the FDA label noted reports of decreased sex drive, problems with ejaculation and difficulty achieving an erection which continued after stopping the medication. The update also referenced reports of testicular pain and ""male infertility and/or poor quality of semen."": 17 ==== Finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia ==== The most common adverse sexual effects of finasteride for BPH are: trouble getting or keeping an erection, decrease in sex drive, decreased volume of ejaculate, and ejaculation disorders.: 16 A 2010 Cochrane review found that men taking finasteride for BPH (with a mean age of 62.4) are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction (ED), decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder for the first year of treatment. The rates became indistinguishable from placebo after 2–4 years and these side effects usually got better over time. === Long-term === Finasteride may cause persistent adverse sexual, neurological, and physical effects in a subset of men. A 2019 metastudy surveyed the literature on the reversibility of finasteride's side effects. It identified three studies that demonstrated full reversibility of side effects and eleven that described patients with irreversible adverse events. The findings were most convincing in a retrospective review of about 12,000 patients that 1.4% of the cohort developed persistent ED (ED lasting longer than 90 days post-withdrawal). == Post-finasteride syndrome == Reports of long-term, post-discontinuation adverse effects in some fraction of former finasteride users have led to a proposed post-finasteride syndrome (PFS), although some within the medical community question whether there is enough evidence to support a causal relationship between finasteride usage and PFS. Individuals claiming to experience PFS report sexual, neurological, hormonal, and psychological side effects that persist for an extended period after stopping the drug. Reported symptoms include penile atrophy and tissue changes, decreased ejaculate volume and quality, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of penile sensitivity, decreased orgasm sensation, dry skin, metabolic changes, muscle and strength loss, gynecomastia, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, anhedonia, concentration problems, memory impairment and suicidal ideation. A meta-analysis found a significant association between finasteride use and post-discontinuation depression, suicidal ideation, and sexual dysfunction, but the quality of evidence was limited. The status of PFS as a legitimate and distinct medical pathology remains a subject of debate. A 2019 editorial in The BMJ called post-finasteride syndrome ""ill defined and controversial"". Some have argued that it has common features with other self-diagnosed ""mystery syndromes"" such as Morgellons or multiple chemical sensitivity, while others, including some in the biomedical research community, have concluded based on the available evidence, that it represents a real and serious condition. There is no known underlying biological mechanism for the proposed syndrome, and its incidence is unclear. A lack of clear diagnostic criteria and the variable reporting fraction in different healthcare settings make the problem challenging to evaluate. As of 2016, Merck was a defendant in approximately 1,370 product liability lawsuits which had been filed by customers alleging they have experienced persistent sexual side effects following cessation of treatment with finasteride. Most cases were settled by 2018 when Merck paid a lump sum of US$4.3 million to be distributed. As of September 2019, 25 cases remained outstanding in the United States. In 2019, Reuters reported that faulty redactions in court documents revealed allegations from plaintiffs that Merck had known of persistent side effects in their original clinical trials but chose not to disclose them in warning labels. == Overdose == Finasteride has been studied in humans at single doses of up to 400 mg and at continuous dosages of up to 80 mg/day for three months, without adverse effects observed. There is no specific recommended antidote for finasteride overdose. == Interactions == No significant drug interactions have been observed between finasteride and a limited selection of medications. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Finasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor. It is specifically a selective inhibitor of the type II and III isoforms of the enzyme. By inhibiting these two isozymes of 5α-reductase, finasteride reduces the formation of the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from its precursor testosterone in certain tissues in the body such as the prostate gland, skin, and hair follicles. As such, finasteride is a type of antiandrogen, or more specifically, an androgen synthesis inhibitor. However, some authors do not define finasteride as an ""antiandrogen,"" a term which can refer more specifically to antagonists of the androgen receptor. Finasteride results in a decrease of circulating DHT levels by about 65–70% with an oral dosage of 5 mg/day and of DHT levels in the prostate gland by up to 80–90% with an oral dosage of 1 or 5 mg/day. In parallel, circulating levels of testosterone increase by approximately 10%, while local concentrations of testosterone in the prostate gland increase by about 7-fold and local testosterone levels in hair follicles increase by around 27–53%. An oral dosage of finasteride of only 0.2 mg/day has been found to achieve near-maximal suppression of DHT levels (68.6% for 0.2 mg/day relative to 72.2% for 5 mg/day). Finasteride does not completely suppress DHT production because it lacks significant inhibitory effects on the 5α-reductase type I isoenzyme, with more than 100-fold less inhibitory potency for type I as compared to type II (IC50Tooltip Half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 313 nM and 11 nM, respectively). This is in contrast to inhibitors of all three isoenzymes of 5α-reductase like dutasteride, which can reduce DHT levels in the entire body by more than 99%. In addition to inhibiting 5α-reductase, finasteride has also been found to competitively inhibit 5β-reductase (AKR1D1). However, its affinity for the enzyme is substantially less than for 5α-reductase (an order of magnitude less than for 5α-reductase type I) and hence is unlikely to be of clinical significance. As of 2012, the tissues in which the different isozymes of 5α-reductase are expressed are not fully clear. This is because different investigators have obtained varying results with different reagents, methods, and tissues examined. However, the different isozymes of 5α-reductase appear to be widely expressed, with notable tissues including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, testes, epididymides, skin, hair follicles, liver, kidneys, and brain, among others. By inhibiting 5α-reductase and thus preventing DHT production, finasteride reduces androgen signaling in tissues like the prostate gland and the scalp. In the prostate, this reduces prostate volume, which improves BPH and reduces the risk of prostate cancer. Finasteride reduces prostate volume by 20 to 30% in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Inhibition of 5α-reductase also reduces epididymal weight, and decreases motility and normal morphology of spermatozoa in the epididymis. Neurosteroids like 3α-androstanediol (derived from DHT) and allopregnanolone (derived from progesterone) activate the GABAA receptor in the brain; because finasteride prevents the formation of neurosteroids, it functions as a neurosteroidogenesis inhibitor and may contribute to a reduction of GABAA activity. Reduction of GABAA receptor activation by these neurosteroids has been implicated in depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction. In accordance with finasteride being a potent 5α-reductase inhibitor but a weak inhibitor of 5β-reductase, the medication decreases circulating levels of 5α-reduced steroids like allopregnanolone but does not reduce concentrations of 5β-reduced steroids like pregnanolone. Pregnanolone acts as a potent GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator similarly to allopregnanolone. === Pharmacokinetics === The mean oral bioavailability of finasteride is approximately 65%. The absorption of finasteride is not affected by food. At steady-state with 1 mg/day finasteride, mean peak concentrations of finasteride were 9.2 ng/mL (25 nmol/L). Conversely, following a single 5 mg dose of finasteride, mean peak levels of finasteride were 37 ng/mL (99 nmol/L), and plasma concentrations increased by 47–54% following 2.5 weeks of continued daily administration. The volume of distribution of finasteride is 76 L. Its plasma protein binding is 90%. The drug has been found to cross the blood–brain barrier, whereas levels in semen were found to be undetectable. Finasteride is extensively metabolized in the liver, first by hydroxylation via CYP3A4 and then by aldehyde dehydrogenase. It has two major metabolites, which are the tert-butyl side chain monohydroxylated and monocarboxylic acid metabolites. These metabolites show approximately 20% of the inhibitory activity of finasteride on 5α-reductase. Hence, the metabolites of finasteride are not particularly active. The drug has a terminal half-life of 5 to 6 hours in adult men (18–60 years of age) and a terminal half-life of 8 hours or more in elderly men (more than 70 years of age). It is eliminated as its metabolites 57% in the feces and 40% in the urine. == Chemistry == Finasteride, also known as 17β-(N-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-4-aza-5α-androst-1-en-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and 4-azasteroid. It is an analogue of androgen steroid hormones like testosterone and DHT. As an unconjugated steroid, finasteride is a highly lipophilic compound. == History == In 1942, James Hamilton observed that prepubertal castration prevents the later development of male pattern baldness in mature men. In 1974, Julianne Imperato-McGinley of Cornell Medical College in New York attended a conference on birth defects. She reported on a group of intersex children in the Caribbean who appeared sexually ambiguous at birth, and were initially raised as girls, but then grew external male genitalia and other masculine characteristic after onset of puberty. These children, despite being raised as girls until puberty, were generally heterosexual and were termed ""Guevedoces"" by their local community, which means ""penis at twelve"" in Spanish. Her research group found these children shared a genetic mutation, causing deficiency of the 5α-reductase enzyme and male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which was found to have been the etiology behind abnormalities in male sexual development. Upon maturation, these individuals were observed to have smaller prostates which were underdeveloped, and were also observed to lack incidence of male pattern baldness. In 1975, copies of Imperato-McGinley's presentation were seen by P. Roy Vagelos, who was then serving as Merck's basic research chief. He was intrigued by the notion that decreased levels of DHT led to the development of smaller prostates. Dr. Vagelos then sought to create a drug that could mimic the condition found in these children to treat older men who had benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finasteride was developed by Merck under the code name MK-906. A team led by chemist Gary Rasmusson and biologist Jerry Brooks developed potential 5α-reductase inhibitors based on transition-state inhibitors, using an iterative process of molecular design, testing, and redesign. In 1992, finasteride (5 mg) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of BPH, which Merck marketed under the brand name Proscar. Rasmusson and Brooks were awarded IPO's ""Inventor of the Year"" award in 1993 for their work on finasteride. In 1997, Merck was successful in obtaining FDA approval for a second indication of finasteride (1 mg) for treatment of male pattern hair loss, which was marketed under the brand name Propecia. It was the first 5α-reductase inhibitor to be introduced and was followed by dutasteride in 2001. The first study of finasteride in the treatment of hirsutism in women was published in 1994. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Finasteride is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while finastéride is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. It is also known by its former developmental code names MK-906, YM-152, and L-652,931. === Brand names === Finasteride is marketed primarily under the brand names Propecia, for pattern hair loss, and Proscar, for BPH, both of which are products of Merck & Co. There is 1 mg of finasteride in Propecia and 5 mg in Proscar. Merck's patent on finasteride for the treatment of BPH expired in June 2006. Merck was awarded a separate patent for the use of finasteride to treat pattern hair loss and it expired in November 2013. Finasteride is also marketed under a variety of other brand names throughout the world. === Athletics === From 2005 to 2009, the World Anti-Doping Agency banned finasteride because it was discovered that the drug could be used to mask steroid abuse. It was removed from the list effective 1 January 2009, after improvements in testing methods made the ban unnecessary. Athletes who used finasteride and were banned from international competition include skeleton racer Zach Lund, bobsledder Sebastien Gattuso, footballer Romário, and ice hockey goaltender José Théodore. === Miscellaneous === The US Food and Drug Administration advises that donation of blood or plasma be deferred for at least one month after taking the last dose of finasteride. The UK also has a one-month deferral period. == Research == Preliminary research suggests that topical finasteride may be effective in the treatment of pattern hair loss. Topical finasteride, like the oral preparation, reduces serum DHT. DHT may be involved in the cause of acne, and 5α-reductase inhibitors might be effective in the treatment of the condition. A small retrospective study reported that finasteride was effective in the treatment of acne in women with normal testosterone levels. A randomized controlled trial found that finasteride was less effective than flutamide or an ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate birth control pill in the treatment of acne in women with high androgen levels. Androgens and estrogens may be involved in the cause of hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa). Two case series have reported that finasteride is effective in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa in girls and women. Finasteride and other antiandrogens might be useful in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder, but more research is needed. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -3.1281633e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
452	Acetylcholine	WIKIPEDIA	"Acetylcholine (ACh) is an organic compound that functions in the brain and body of many types of animals (including humans) as a neurotransmitter. Its name is derived from its chemical structure: it is an ester of acetic acid and choline. Parts in the body that use or are affected by acetylcholine are referred to as cholinergic. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction—in other words, it is the chemical that motor neurons of the nervous system release in order to activate muscles. This property means that drugs that affect cholinergic systems can have very dangerous effects ranging from paralysis to convulsions. Acetylcholine is also a neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system, both as an internal transmitter for both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system, and as the final product released by the parasympathetic nervous system. Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system. In the brain, acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator. The brain contains a number of cholinergic areas, each with distinct functions; such as playing an important role in arousal, attention, memory and motivation. Acetylcholine has also been found in cells of non-neural origins as well as microbes. Recently, enzymes related to its synthesis, degradation and cellular uptake have been traced back to early origins of unicellular eukaryotes. The protist pathogens Acanthamoeba spp. have shown evidence of the presence of ACh, which provides growth and proliferative signals via a membrane-located M1-muscarinic receptor homolog. Partly because of acetylcholine's muscle-activating function, but also because of its functions in the autonomic nervous system and brain, many important drugs exert their effects by altering cholinergic transmission. Numerous venoms and toxins produced by plants, animals, and bacteria, as well as chemical nerve agents such as sarin, cause harm by inactivating or hyperactivating muscles through their influences on the neuromuscular junction. Drugs that act on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, such as atropine, can be poisonous in large quantities, but in smaller doses they are commonly used to treat certain heart conditions and eye problems. Scopolamine, or diphenhydramine, which also act mainly on muscarinic receptors in an inhibitory fashion in the brain (especially the M1 receptor) can cause delirium, hallucinations, and amnesia through receptor antagonism at these sites. So far as of 2016, only the M1 receptor subtype has been implicated in anticholinergic delirium. The addictive qualities of nicotine are derived from its effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. == Chemistry == Acetylcholine is a choline molecule that has been acetylated at the oxygen atom. Because of the charged ammonium group, acetylcholine does not penetrate lipid membranes. Because of this, when the molecule is introduced externally, it remains in the extracellular space and at present it is considered that the molecule does not pass through the blood–brain barrier. == Biochemistry == Acetylcholine is synthesized in certain neurons by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase from the compounds choline and acetyl-CoA. Cholinergic neurons are capable of producing ACh. An example of a central cholinergic area is the nucleus basalis of Meynert in the basal forebrain. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase converts acetylcholine into the inactive metabolites choline and acetate. This enzyme is abundant in the synaptic cleft, and its role in rapidly clearing free acetylcholine from the synapse is essential for proper muscle function. Certain neurotoxins work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, thus leading to excess acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis of the muscles needed for breathing and stopping the beating of the heart. == Functions == Acetylcholine functions in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the CNS, cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus support the cognitive functions of those target areas. In the PNS, acetylcholine activates muscles and is a major neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system. === Cellular effects === Like many other biologically active substances, acetylcholine exerts its effects by binding to and activating receptors located on the surface of cells. There are two main classes of acetylcholine receptor, nicotinic and muscarinic. They are named for chemicals that can selectively activate each type of receptor without activating the other: muscarine is a compound found in the mushroom Amanita muscaria; nicotine is found in tobacco. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium ions. In other words, they are ion channels embedded in cell membranes, capable of switching from a closed to an open state when acetylcholine binds to them; in the open state they allow ions to pass through. Nicotinic receptors come in two main types, known as muscle-type and neuronal-type. The muscle-type can be selectively blocked by curare, the neuronal-type by hexamethonium. The main location of muscle-type receptors is on muscle cells, as described in more detail below. Neuronal-type receptors are located in autonomic ganglia (both sympathetic and parasympathetic), and in the central nervous system. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors have a more complex mechanism, and affect target cells over a longer time frame. In mammals, five subtypes of muscarinic receptors have been identified, labeled M1 through M5. All of them function as G protein-coupled receptors, meaning that they exert their effects via a second messenger system. The M1, M3, and M5 subtypes are Gq-coupled; they increase intracellular levels of IP3 and calcium by activating phospholipase C. Their effect on target cells is usually excitatory. The M2 and M4 subtypes are Gi/Go-coupled; they decrease intracellular levels of cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Their effect on target cells is usually inhibitory. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are found in both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system of the heart, lungs, upper gastrointestinal tract, and sweat glands. === Neuromuscular junction === Acetylcholine is the substance the nervous system uses to activate skeletal muscles, a kind of striated muscle. These are the muscles used for all types of voluntary movement, in contrast to smooth muscle tissue, which is involved in a range of involuntary activities such as movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract and constriction of blood vessels. Skeletal muscles are directly controlled by motor neurons located in the spinal cord or, in a few cases, the brainstem. These motor neurons send their axons through motor nerves, from which they emerge to connect to muscle fibers at a special type of synapse called the neuromuscular junction. When a motor neuron generates an action potential, it travels rapidly along the nerve until it reaches the neuromuscular junction, where it initiates an electrochemical process that causes acetylcholine to be released into the space between the presynaptic terminal and the muscle fiber. The acetylcholine molecules then bind to nicotinic ion-channel receptors on the muscle cell membrane, causing the ion channels to open. Sodium ions then flow into the muscle cell, initiating a sequence of steps that finally produce muscle contraction. Factors that decrease release of acetylcholine (and thereby affecting P-type calcium channels): Antibiotics (clindamycin, polymyxin) Magnesium: antagonizes P-type calcium channels Hypocalcemia Anticonvulsants Diuretics (furosemide) Eaton-Lambert syndrome: inhibits P-type calcium channels Myasthenia gravis Botulinum toxin: inhibits SNARE proteins Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, diltiazem) do not affect P-channels. These drugs affect L-type calcium channels. === Autonomic nervous system === The autonomic nervous system controls a wide range of involuntary and unconscious body functions. Its main branches are the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. Broadly speaking, the function of the sympathetic nervous system is to mobilize the body for action; the phrase often invoked to describe it is fight-or-flight. The function of the parasympathetic nervous system is to put the body in a state conducive to rest, regeneration, digestion, and reproduction; the phrase often invoked to describe it is ""rest and digest"" or ""feed and breed"". Both of these aforementioned systems use acetylcholine, but in different ways. At a schematic level, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are both organized in essentially the same way: preganglionic neurons in the central nervous system send projections to neurons located in autonomic ganglia, which send output projections to virtually every tissue of the body. In both branches the internal connections, the projections from the central nervous system to the autonomic ganglia, use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter to innervate (or excite) ganglia neurons. In the parasympathetic nervous system the output connections, the projections from ganglion neurons to tissues that do not belong to the nervous system, also release acetylcholine but act on muscarinic receptors. In the sympathetic nervous system the output connections mainly release noradrenaline, although acetylcholine is released at a few points, such as the sudomotor innervation of the sweat glands. ==== Direct vascular effects ==== Acetylcholine in the serum exerts a direct effect on vascular tone by binding to muscarinic receptors present on vascular endothelium. These cells respond by increasing production of nitric oxide, which signals the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, leading to vasodilation. === Central nervous system === In the central nervous system, ACh has a variety of effects on plasticity, arousal and reward. ACh has an important role in the enhancement of alertness when we wake up, in sustaining attention and in learning and memory. Damage to the cholinergic (acetylcholine-producing) system in the brain has been shown to be associated with the memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease. ACh has also been shown to promote REM sleep. In the brainstem acetylcholine originates from the Pedunculopontine nucleus and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus collectively known as the mesopontine tegmentum area or pontomesencephalotegmental complex. In the basal forebrain, it originates from the basal nucleus of Meynert and medial septal nucleus: The pontomesencephalotegmental complex acts mainly on M1 receptors in the brainstem, deep cerebellar nuclei, pontine nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus and inferior olive. It also projects to the thalamus, tectum, basal ganglia and basal forebrain. Basal nucleus of Meynert acts mainly on M1 receptors in the neocortex. Medial septal nucleus acts mainly on M1 receptors in the hippocampus and parts of the cerebral cortex. In addition, ACh acts as an important internal transmitter in the striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia. It is released by cholinergic interneurons. In humans, non-human primates and rodents, these interneurons respond to salient environmental stimuli with responses that are temporally aligned with the responses of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. ==== Memory ==== Acetylcholine has been implicated in learning and memory in several ways. The anticholinergic drug scopolamine impairs acquisition of new information in humans and animals. In animals, disruption of the supply of acetylcholine to the neocortex impairs the learning of simple discrimination tasks, comparable to the acquisition of factual information and disruption of the supply of acetylcholine to the hippocampus and adjacent cortical areas produces forgetfulness, comparable to anterograde amnesia in humans. == Diseases and disorders == === Myasthenia gravis === The disease myasthenia gravis, characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, occurs when the body inappropriately produces antibodies against acetylcholine nicotinic receptors, and thus inhibits proper acetylcholine signal transmission. Over time, the motor end plate is destroyed. Drugs that competitively inhibit acetylcholinesterase (e.g., neostigmine, physostigmine, or primarily pyridostigmine) are effective in treating the symptoms of this disorder. They allow endogenously released acetylcholine more time to interact with its respective receptor before being inactivated by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft (the space between nerve and muscle). == Pharmacology == Blocking, hindering or mimicking the action of acetylcholine has many uses in medicine. Drugs acting on the acetylcholine system are either agonists to the receptors, stimulating the system, or antagonists, inhibiting it. Acetylcholine receptor agonists and antagonists can either have an effect directly on the receptors or exert their effects indirectly, e.g., by affecting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which degrades the receptor ligand. Agonists increase the level of receptor activation; antagonists reduce it. Acetylcholine itself does not have therapeutic value as a drug for intravenous administration because of its multi-faceted action (non-selective) and rapid inactivation by cholinesterase. However, it is used in the form of eye drops to cause constriction of the pupil during cataract surgery, which facilitates quick post-operational recovery. === Nicotinic receptors === Nicotine binds to and activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, mimicking the effect of acetylcholine at these receptors. ACh opens a Na+ channel upon binding so that Na+ flows into the cell. This causes a depolarization, and results in an excitatory post-synaptic potential. Thus, ACh is excitatory on skeletal muscle; the electrical response is fast and short-lived. Curares are arrow poisons, which act at nicotinic receptors and have been used to develop clinically useful therapies. === Muscarinic receptors === Muscarinic receptors form G protein-coupled receptor complexes in the cell membranes of neurons and other cells. Atropine is a non-selective competitive antagonist with Acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. === Cholinesterase inhibitors === Many ACh receptor agonists work indirectly by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The resulting accumulation of acetylcholine causes continuous stimulation of the muscles, glands, and central nervous system, which can result in fatal convulsions if the dose is high. They are examples of enzyme inhibitors, and increase the action of acetylcholine by delaying its degradation; some have been used as nerve agents (Sarin and VX nerve gas) or pesticides (organophosphates and the carbamates). Many toxins and venoms produced by plants and animals also contain cholinesterase inhibitors. In clinical use, they are administered in low doses to reverse the action of muscle relaxants, to treat myasthenia gravis, and to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (rivastigmine, which increases cholinergic activity in the brain). === Synthesis inhibitors === Organic mercurial compounds, such as methylmercury, have a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups, which causes dysfunction of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. This inhibition may lead to acetylcholine deficiency, and can have consequences on motor function. === Release inhibitors === Botulinum toxin (Botox) acts by suppressing the release of acetylcholine, whereas the venom from a black widow spider (alpha-latrotoxin) has the reverse effect. ACh inhibition causes paralysis. When bitten by a black widow spider, one experiences the wastage of ACh supplies and the muscles begin to contract. If and when the supply is depleted, paralysis occurs. == Comparative biology and evolution == Acetylcholine is used by organisms in all domains of life for a variety of purposes. It is believed that choline, a precursor to acetylcholine, was used by single celled organisms billions of years ago for synthesizing cell membrane phospholipids. Following the evolution of choline transporters, the abundance of intracellular choline paved the way for choline to become incorporated into other synthetic pathways, including acetylcholine production. Acetylcholine is used by bacteria, fungi, and a variety of other animals. Many of the uses of acetylcholine rely on its action on ion channels via GPCRs like membrane proteins. The two major types of acetylcholine receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, have convergently evolved to be responsive to acetylcholine. This means that rather than having evolved from a common homolog, these receptors evolved from separate receptor families. It is estimated that the nicotinic receptor family dates back longer than 2.5 billion years. Likewise, muscarinic receptors are thought to have diverged from other GPCRs at least 0.5 billion years ago. Both of these receptor groups have evolved numerous subtypes with unique ligand affinities and signaling mechanisms. The diversity of the receptor types enables acetylcholine to create varying responses depending on which receptor types are activated, and allow for acetylcholine to dynamically regulate physiological processes. ACh receptors are related to 5-HT3 (serotonin), GABA, and Glycine receptors, both in sequence and structure, strongly suggesting that they have a common evolutionary origin. == History == In 1867, Adolf von Baeyer resolved the structures of choline and acetylcholine and synthesized them both, referring to the latter as acetylneurin in the study. Choline is a precursor for acetylcholine. Acetylcholine was first noted to be biologically active in 1906, when Reid Hunt (1870–1948) and René de M. Taveau found that it decreased blood pressure in exceptionally tiny doses. This was after Frederick Walker Mott and William Dobinson Halliburton noted in 1899 that choline injections decreased the blood pressure of animals. In 1914, Arthur J. Ewins was the first to extract acetylcholine from nature. He identified it as the blood pressure-decreasing contaminant from some Claviceps purpurea ergot extracts, by the request of Henry Hallett Dale. Later in 1914, Dale outlined the effects of acetylcholine at various types of peripheral synapses and also noted that it lowered the blood pressure of cats via subcutaneous injections even at doses of one nanogram. The concept of neurotransmitters was unknown until 1921, when Otto Loewi noted that the vagus nerve secreted a substance that inhibited the heart muscle whilst working as a professor in the University of Graz. He named it vagusstoff (""vagus substance""), noted it to be a structural analog of choline and suspected it to be acetylcholine. In 1926, Loewi and E. Navratil deduced that the compound is probably acetylcholine, as vagusstoff and synthetic acetylcholine lost their activity in a similar manner when in contact with tissue lysates that contained acetylcholine-degrading enzymes (now known to be cholinesterases). This conclusion was accepted widely. Later studies confirmed the function of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. In 1936, H. H. Dale and O. Loewi shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their studies of acetylcholine and nerve impulses. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Warning over combining common medicines for elderly"	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	{'MED': -0.31413248, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' EN': -3.5313153e-06, 'DO': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': -4.3202e-07}
454	Diltiazem	WIKIPEDIA	Diltiazem, sold under the brand name Cardizem among others, is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker medication used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart arrhythmias. It may also be used in hyperthyroidism if beta blockers cannot be used. It is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein. When given by injection, effects typically begin within a few minutes and last a few hours. Common side effects include swelling, dizziness, headaches, and low blood pressure. Other severe side effects include an overly slow heart beat, heart failure, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Use is not recommended during pregnancy. It is unclear if use when breastfeeding is safe. Diltiazem works by relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of arteries, resulting in them opening and allowing blood to flow more easily. Additionally, it acts on the heart to prolong the period until it can beat again. It does this by blocking the entry of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. It is a class IV antiarrhythmic. Diltiazem was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 100th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. An extended release formulation is also available. == Medical uses == Diltiazem is indicated for: Stable angina (exercise-induced) – diltiazem increases coronary blood flow and decreases myocardial oxygen consumption, secondary to decreased peripheral resistance, heart rate, and contractility. Variant angina – it is effective owing to its direct effects on coronary dilation. Unstable angina (preinfarction, crescendo) – diltiazem may be particularly effective if the underlying mechanism is vasospasm. Myocardial bridge For supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT), diltiazem appears to be as effective as verapamil in treating re-entrant supraventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is another indication. The initial bolus should be 0.25 mg/kg, intravenous (IV). Because of its vasodilatory effects, diltiazem is useful for treating hypertension. Calcium channel blockers are well tolerated, and especially effective in treating low-renin hypertension. It is also used as topical application for anal fissures because it promotes healing due to its vasodilatory property. == Contraindications and precautions == In congestive heart failure, patients with reduced ventricular function may not be able to counteract the negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of diltiazem, the result being an even higher compromise of function. With SA node or AV conduction disturbances, the use of diltiazem should be avoided in patients with SA or AV nodal abnormalities, because of its negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects. Low blood pressure patients, with systolic blood pressures below 90 mm Hg, should not be treated with diltiazem. Diltiazem may paradoxically increase ventricular rate in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome because of accessory conduction pathways. Diltiazem is relatively contraindicated in the presence of sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular node conduction disturbances, bradycardia, impaired left ventricle function, peripheral artery occlusive disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. == Side effects == A reflex sympathetic response, caused by the peripheral dilation of vessels and the resulting drop in blood pressure, works to counteract the negative inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects of diltiazem. Undesirable effects include hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, headaches and edema. Rare side effects are congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and hepatotoxicity. == Drug interactions == Because of its inhibition of hepatic cytochromes CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, there are a number of drug interactions. Some of the more important interactions are listed below. === Beta-blockers === Intravenous diltiazem should be used with caution with beta-blockers because, while the combination is most potent at reducing heart rate, there are rare instances of dysrhythmia and AV node block. === Quinidine === Quinidine should not be used concurrently with calcium channel blockers because of reduced clearance of both drugs and potential pharmacodynamic effects at the SA and AV nodes. === Fentanyl === Concurrent use of fentanyl with diltiazem, or any other CYP3A4 inhibitors, as these medications decrease the breakdown of fentanyl and thus increase its effects. == Mechanism of action == Diltiazem, also known as (2S,3S)-3-acetoxy-5-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,5-benzothiazepin-4(5H)-one hydrochlorid has a vasodilating activity attributed to the (2S,3S)-isomer. Diltiazem is a potent vasodilator, increasing blood flow and variably decreasing the heart rate via strong depression of A-V node conduction. It binds to the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels in a fashion somewhat similar to verapamil, another nondihydropyridine (non-DHP) calcium channel blocker. Chemically, it is based upon a 1,4-thiazepine ring, making it a benzothiazepine-type calcium channel blocker. It is a potent and mild vasodilator of coronary and peripheral vessels, respectively, which reduces peripheral resistance and afterload, though not as potent as the dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blockers. This results in minimal reflexive sympathetic changes. Diltiazem has negative inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effects. This means diltiazem causes a decrease in heart muscle contractility – how strong the beat is, lowering of heart rate – due to slowing of the sinoatrial node, and a slowing of conduction through the atrioventricular node – increasing the time needed for each beat. Each of these effects results in reduced oxygen consumption by the heart, reducing angina, typically unstable angina, symptoms. These effects also reduce blood pressure by causing less blood to be pumped out. == Research == Diltiazem is prescribed off-label by doctors in the US for prophylaxis of cluster headaches. Some research on diltiazem and other calcium channel antagonists in the treatment and prophylaxis of migraine is ongoing. Recent research has shown diltiazem may reduce cocaine cravings in drug-addicted rats. This is believed to be due to the effects of calcium blockers on dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling in the brain. Diltiazem also enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in animal tests, without increasing respiratory depression, and reduces the development of tolerance. Diltiazem is also being used in the treatment of anal fissures. It can be taken orally or applied topically with increased effectiveness. When applied topically, it is made into a cream form using either petrolatum or Phlojel. Phlojel absorbs the diltiazem into the problem area better than the petrolatum base. It has good short-term success rates. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
455	Acetaminophen	WIKIPEDIA	"Paracetamol, or acetaminophen, is a non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic agent used to treat fever and mild to moderate pain. It is a widely available over-the-counter drug sold under various brand names, including Tylenol and Panadol. Paracetamol relieves pain in both acute mild migraine and episodic tension headache. At a standard dose, paracetamol slightly reduces fever; it is inferior to ibuprofen in that respect, and the benefits of its use for fever are unclear, particularly in the context of fever of viral origins. The aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination also helps with both conditions where the pain is mild and is recommended as a first-line treatment for them. Paracetamol is effective for post-surgical pain, but it is inferior to ibuprofen. The paracetamol/ibuprofen combination provides further increase in potency and is superior to either drug alone. The pain relief paracetamol provides in osteoarthritis is small and clinically insignificant. The evidence in its favor for the use in low back pain, cancer pain, and neuropathic pain is insufficient. In the short term, paracetamol is safe and effective when used as directed. Short term adverse effects are uncommon and similar to ibuprofen, but paracetamol is typically safer than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for long-term use. Paracetamol is also often used in patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Chronic consumption of paracetamol may result in a drop in hemoglobin level, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding, and abnormal liver function tests. The recommended maximum daily dose for an adult is three to four grams. Higher doses may lead to toxicity, including liver failure. Paracetamol poisoning is the foremost cause of acute liver failure in the Western world, and accounts for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Paracetamol was first made in 1878 by Harmon Northrop Morse or possibly in 1852 by Charles Frédéric Gerhardt. It is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever in both the United States and Europe. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Paracetamol is available as a generic medication, with brand names including Tylenol and Panadol among others. In 2022, it was the 114th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Fever === Paracetamol is used for reducing fever. However, there has been a lack of research on its antipyretic properties, particularly in adults, and thus its benefits are unclear. As a result, it has been described as over-prescribed for this application. In addition, low-quality clinical data indicates that when used for the common cold, paracetamol may relieve a stuffed or runny nose, but not other cold symptoms such as sore throat, malaise, sneezing, or cough. For people in critical care, paracetamol decreases body temperature by only 0.2–0.3 °C more than control interventions and has no effect on their mortality. It did not change the outcome in febrile patients with stroke. The results are contradictory for paracetamol use in sepsis: higher mortality, lower mortality, and no change in mortality were all reported. Paracetamol offered no benefit in the treatment of dengue fever and was accompanied by a higher rate of liver enzyme elevation: a sign of potential liver damage. Overall, there is no support for a routine administration of antipyretic drugs, including paracetamol, to hospitalized patients with fever and infection. The efficacy of paracetamol in children with fever is unclear. Paracetamol should not be used solely to reduce body temperature; however, it may be considered for children with fever who appear distressed. It does not prevent febrile seizures. It appears that 0.2 °C decrease of the body temperature in children after a standard dose of paracetamol is of questionable value, particularly in emergencies. Based on this, some physicians advocate using higher doses that may decrease the temperature by as much as 0.7 °C. Meta-analyses showed that paracetamol is less effective than ibuprofen in children (marginally less effective, according to another analysis), including children younger than 2 years old, with equivalent safety. Exacerbation of asthma occurs with similar frequency for both medications. Giving paracetamol and ibuprofen together at the same time to children under 5 is not recommended; however, doses may be alternated if required. === Pain === Paracetamol is used for the relief of mild to moderate pain such as headache, muscle aches, minor arthritis pain, toothache as well as pain caused by cold, flu, sprains, and dysmenorrhea. It is recommended, in particular, for acute mild to moderate pain, since the evidence for the treatment of chronic pain is insufficient. ==== Musculoskeletal pain ==== The benefits of paracetamol in musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis and backache, are uncertain. It appears to provide only small and not clinically important benefits in osteoarthritis. American College of Rheumatology and Arthritis Foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis notes that the effect size in clinical trials of paracetamol has been very small, which suggests that for most individuals it is ineffective. The guideline conditionally recommends paracetamol for short-term and episodic use to those who do not tolerate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For people taking it regularly, monitoring for liver toxicity is required. Essentially the same recommendation was issued by EULAR for hand osteoarthritis. Similarly, the ESCEO algorithm for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis recommends limiting the use of paracetamol to short-term rescue analgesia only. Paracetamol is ineffective for acute low back pain. No randomized clinical trials evaluated its use for chronic or radicular back pain, and the evidence in favor of paracetamol is lacking. ==== Headaches ==== Paracetamol is effective for acute migraine: 39 % of people experience pain relief at one hour compared with 20 % in the control group. The aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination also ""has strong evidence of effectiveness and can be used as a first-line treatment for migraine"". Paracetamol on its own only slightly alleviates episodic tension headache in those who have them frequently. However, the aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination is superior to both paracetamol alone and placebo and offers meaningful relief of tension headache: two hours after administering the medication, 29 % of those who took the combination were pain-free as compared with 21 % on paracetamol and 18 % on placebo. The German, Austrian, and Swiss headache societies and the German Society of Neurology recommend this combination as a ""highlighted"" one for self-medication of tension headache, with paracetamol/caffeine combination being a ""remedy of first choice"", and paracetamol a ""remedy of second choice"". ==== Dental and other post-surgical pain ==== Pain after a dental surgery provides a reliable model for the action of analgesics on other kinds of acute pain. For the relief of such pain, paracetamol is inferior to ibuprofen. Full therapeutic doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac are clearly more efficacious than the paracetamol/codeine combination which is frequently prescribed for dental pain. The combinations of paracetamol and NSAIDs ibuprofen or diclofenac are promising, possibly offering better pain control than either paracetamol or the NSAID alone. Additionally, the paracetamol/ibuprofen combination may be superior to paracetamol/codeine and ibuprofen/codeine combinations. A meta-analysis of general post-surgical pain, which included dental and other surgery, showed the paracetamol/codeine combination to be more effective than paracetamol alone: it provided significant pain relief to as much as 53 % of the participants, while the placebo helped only 7 %. ==== Other pain ==== Paracetamol fails to relieve procedural pain in newborn babies. For perineal pain postpartum paracetamol appears to be less effective than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The studies to support or refute the use of paracetamol for cancer pain and neuropathic pain are lacking. There is limited evidence in favor of the use of the intravenous form of paracetamol for acute pain control in the emergency department. The combination of paracetamol with caffeine is superior to paracetamol alone for the treatment of acute pain. === Patent ductus arteriosus === Paracetamol helps ductal closure in patent ductus arteriosus. It is as effective for this purpose as ibuprofen or indomethacin, but results in less frequent gastrointestinal bleeding than ibuprofen. Its use for extremely low birth weight and gestational age infants however requires further study. == Adverse effects == Gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea and abdominal pain are extremely uncommon, and their frequency is nothing like that of ibuprofen. Increase in risk-taking behavior is possible. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the drug may cause rare and possibly fatal skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, Rechallenge tests and an analysis of American but not French pharmacovigilance databases indicated a risk of these reactions. In clinical trials for osteoarthritis, the number of participants reporting adverse effects was similar for those on paracetamol and on placebo. However, the abnormal liver function tests (meaning there was some inflammation or damage to the liver) were almost four times more likely in those on paracetamol, although the clinical importance of this effect is uncertain. After 13 weeks of paracetamol therapy for knee pain, a drop in hemoglobin level indicating gastrointestinal bleeding was observed in 20 % of participants, this rate being similar to the ibuprofen group. Due to the absence of controlled studies, most of the information about the long-term safety of paracetamol comes from observational studies. These indicate a consistent pattern of increased mortality as well as cardiovascular (stroke, myocardial infarction), gastrointestinal (ulcers, bleeding) and renal adverse effects with increased dose of paracetamol. Use of paracetamol is associated with 1.9 times higher risk of peptic ulcer. Those who take it regularly at a higher dose (more than 2–3 g daily) are at much higher risk (3.6–3.7 times) of gastrointestinal bleeding and other bleeding events. Meta-analyses suggest that paracetamol may increase the risk of kidney impairment by 23 % and kidney cancer by 28 %. Paracetamol slightly but significantly increases blood pressure and heart rate. A 2022 double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study has provided evidence that daily, high-dose use (4 g per day) of paracetamol increases systolic BP. A review of available research has suggested that increase in systolic blood pressure and increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with chronic paracetamol use shows a degree of dose dependence. The association between paracetamol use and asthma in children has been a matter of controversy. However, the most recent research suggests that there is no association, and that the frequency of asthma exacerbations in children after paracetamol is the same as after another frequently used pain killer, ibuprofen. In recommended doses, the side effects of paracetamol are mild to non-existent. In contrast to aspirin, it is not a blood thinner (and thus may be used in patients where bleeding is a concern), and it does not cause gastric irritation. Compared to Ibuprofen—which can have adverse effects that include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain—paracetamol is well tolerated with fewer side effects. Prolonged daily use may cause kidney or liver damage.Paracetamol is metabolized by the liver and is hepatotoxic; side effects may be more likely in chronic alcoholics or patients with liver damage. Until 2010 paracetamol was believed safe in pregnancy however, in a study published in October 2010 it has been linked to infertility in the adult life of the unborn. Like NSAIDs and unlike opioid analgesics, paracetamol has not been found to cause euphoria or alter mood. One recent research study showed evidence that paracetamol can ease psychological pain, but more studies are needed to draw a stronger conclusion. Unlike aspirin, it is safe for children, as paracetamol is not associated with a risk of Reye's syndrome in children with viral illnesses. Chronic users of paracetamol may have a higher risk of developing blood cancer. === Use in pregnancy === Paracetamol safety in pregnancy has been under increased scrutiny. There appears to be no link between paracetamol use in the first trimester and adverse pregnancy outcomes or birth defects. However, indications exist of a possible increase in the risk of asthma and developmental and reproductive disorders in the offspring of women with prolonged use of paracetamol during pregnancy. Paracetamol use by the mother during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma, but so are the maternal infections for which paracetamol may be used, and separating these influences is difficult. Paracetamol, in a small-scale meta-analysis was also associated with a 20–30 % increase in autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorder, with the association being lower in a meta-analysis where a larger demographic was used, but it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship and whether there was potential bias in the findings. There is also an argument that the large number, consistency, and robust designs of the studies provide strong evidence in favor of paracetamol causing the increased risk of these neurodevelopmental disorders. In animal experiments, paracetamol disrupts fetal testosterone production, and several epidemiological studies linked cryptorchidism with mother's paracetamol use for more than two weeks in the second trimester. On the other hand, several studies did not find any association. The consensus recommendation appears to be to avoid prolonged use of paracetamol in pregnancy and use it only when necessary, at the lowest effective dosage, and for the shortest time. In pregnancy, paracetamol and metoclopramide are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester. == Overdose == Overdose of paracetamol is caused by taking more than the recommended maximum daily dose of paracetamol for healthy adults (three or four grams), and can cause potentially fatal liver damage. A single dose should not exceed 1000 mg, doses should be taken no sooner than four hours apart, and no more than four doses (4000 mg) in 24 hours. While a majority of adult overdoses are linked to suicide attempts, many cases are accidental, often due to the use of more than one paracetamol-containing product over an extended period. Paracetamol toxicity has become the foremost cause of acute liver failure in the United States by 2003, and as of 2005, paracetamol accounted for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. As of 2004, paracetamol overdose resulted in more calls to poison control centers in the U.S. than overdose of any other pharmacological substance. According to the FDA, in the United States, ""56,000 emergency room visits, 26,000 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths per year [were] related to acetaminophen-associated overdoses during the 1990s. Within these estimates, unintentional acetaminophen overdose accounted for nearly 25 % of the emergency department visits, 10 % of the hospitalizations, and 25 % of the deaths."" Overdoses are frequently related to high-dose recreational use of prescription opioids, as these opioids are most often combined with paracetamol. The overdose risk may be heightened by frequent consumption of alcohol. Untreated paracetamol overdose results in a lengthy, painful illness. Signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity may initially be absent or non-specific symptoms. The first symptoms of overdose usually begin several hours after ingestion, with nausea, vomiting, sweating, and pain as acute liver failure starts. People who take overdoses of paracetamol do not fall asleep or lose consciousness, although most people who attempt suicide with paracetamol wrongly believe that they will be rendered unconscious by the drug. Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replenishing glutathione. Activated charcoal can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the person comes to the hospital soon after the overdose. While the antidote, acetylcysteine (also called N-acetylcysteine or NAC), acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent or at least decrease the possible damage to the liver; a liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for people with risk factors, and one for those without), but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as evidence to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent, and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Toxicity of paracetamol is due to its quinone metabolite NAPQI and NAC also helps in neutralizing it. Kidney failure is also a possible side effect. == Interactions == Prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide accelerate gastric emptying, shorten time (tmax) to paracetamol peak blood plasma concentration (Cmax), and increase Cmax. Medications slowing gastric emptying such as propantheline and morphine lengthen tmax and decrease Cmax. The interaction with morphine may result in patients failing to achieve the therapeutic concentration of paracetamol; the clinical significance of interactions with metoclopramide and propantheline is unclear. There have been suspicions that cytochrome inducers may enhance the toxic pathway of paracetamol metabolism to NAPQI (see Paracetamol#Pharmacokinetics). By and large, these suspicions have not been confirmed. Out of the inducers studied, the evidence of potentially increased liver toxicity in paracetamol overdose exists for phenobarbital, primidone, isoniazid, and possibly St John's wort. On the other hand, the anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid cuts the formation of NAPQI by 70%. Ranitidine increased paracetamol area under the curve (AUC) 1.6-fold. AUC increases are also observed with nizatidine and cisapride. The effect is explained by these drugs inhibiting glucuronidation of paracetamol. Paracetamol raises plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol by 22 % by inhibiting its sulfation. Paracetamol increases INR during warfarin therapy and should be limited to no more than 2 g per week. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Paracetamol appears to exert its effects through two mechanisms: the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) and actions of its metabolite N-arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404). Supporting the first mechanism, pharmacologically and in its side effects, paracetamol is close to classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that act by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes and especially similar to selective COX-2 inhibitors. Paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by reducing the active form of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This occurs only when the concentration of arachidonic acid and peroxides is low. Under these conditions, COX-2 is the predominant form of cyclooxygenase, which explains the apparent COX-2 selectivity of paracetamol. Under the conditions of inflammation, the concentration of peroxides is high, which counteracts the reducing effect of paracetamol. Accordingly, the anti-inflammatory action of paracetamol is slight. The anti-inflammatory action of paracetamol (via COX inhibition) has also been found to primarily target the central nervous system and not peripheral areas of the body, explaining the lack of side effects associated with conventional NSAIDs such as gastric bleeding. The second mechanism centers on the paracetamol metabolite AM404. This metabolite has been detected in the brains of animals and cerebrospinal fluid of humans taking paracetamol. It is formed in the brain from another paracetamol metabolite 4-aminophenol by action of fatty acid amide hydrolase. AM404 is a weak agonist of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, an inhibitor of endocannabinoid transporter, and a potent activator of TRPV1 receptor. This and other research indicate that the endocannabinoid system and TRPV1 may play an important role in the analgesic effect of paracetamol. In 2018, Suemaru et al. found that, in mice, paracetamol exerts an anticonvulsant effect by activation of the TRPV1 receptors and a decrease in neuronal excitability by hyperpolarization of neurons. The exact mechanism of the anticonvulsant effect of acetaminophen is not clear. According to Suemaru et al., acetaminophen and its active metabolite AM404 show a dose-dependent anticonvulsant activity against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice. === Pharmacokinetics === After being taken by mouth, paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine, while absorption from the stomach is negligible. Thus, the rate of absorption depends on stomach emptying. Food slows the stomach's emptying and absorption, but the total amount absorbed stays the same. In the same subjects, the peak plasma concentration of paracetamol was reached after 20 minutes when fasting versus 90 minutes when fed. High carbohydrate (but not high protein or high fat) food decreases paracetamol peak plasma concentration by four times. Even in the fasting state, the rate of absorption of paracetamol is variable and depends on the formulation, with maximum plasma concentration being reached after 20 minutes to 1.5 hours. Paracetamol's bioavailability is dose-dependent: it increases from 63 % for 500 mg dose to 89 % for 1000 mg dose. Its plasma terminal elimination half-life is 1.9–2.5 hours, and volume of distribution is roughly 50 L. Protein binding is negligible, except under the conditions of overdose, when it may reach 15–21 %. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 μg/mL (200 μmol/L). After 4 hours, the concentration is usually less than 10 μg/mL (66 μmol/L). Paracetamol is metabolized primarily in the liver, mainly by glucuronidation and sulfation, and the products are then eliminated in the urine (see the Scheme on the right). Only 2–5 % of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Glucuronidation by UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 accounts for 50–70 % of the drug metabolism. Additional 25–35 % of paracetamol is converted to sulfate by sulfation enzymes SULT1A1, SULT1A3, and SULT1E1. A minor metabolic pathway (5–15 %) of oxidation by cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly by CYP2E1, forms a toxic metabolite known as NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine). NAPQI is responsible for the liver toxicity of paracetamol. At usual doses of paracetamol, NAPQI is quickly detoxified by conjugation with glutathione. The non-toxic conjugate APAP-GSH is taken up in the bile and further degraded to mercapturic and cysteine conjugates that are excreted in the urine. In overdose, glutathione is depleted by a large amount of formed NAPQI, and NAPQI binds to mitochondria proteins of the liver cells causing oxidative stress and toxicity. Yet another minor but important direction of metabolism is deacetylation of 1–2 % of paracetamol to form p-aminophenol. p-Aminophenol is then converted in the brain by fatty acid amide hydrolase into AM404, a compound that may be partially responsible for the analgesic action of paracetamol. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === ==== Classical methods ==== The classical methods for the production of paracetamol involve the acetylation of 4-aminophenol with acetic anhydride as the last step. They differ in how 4-aminophenol is prepared. In one method, nitration of phenol with nitric acid affords 4-nitrophenol, which is reduced to 4-aminophenol by hydrogenation over Raney nickel. In another method, nitrobenzene is reduced electrolytically giving 4-aminophenol directly. Additionally, 4-nitrophenol can be selectively reduced by Tin(II) Chloride in absolute ethanol or ethyl acetate to produce a 91 % yield of 4-aminophenol. ==== Celanese synthesis ==== An alternative industrial synthesis developed at Celanese involves firstly direct acylation of phenol with acetic anhydride in the presence of hydrogen fluoride to a ketone, then the conversion of the ketone with hydroxylamine to a ketoxime, and finally the acid-catalyzed Beckmann rearrangement of the cetoxime to the para-acetylaminophenol product. === Reactions === 4-Aminophenol may be obtained by the amide hydrolysis of paracetamol. This reaction is also used to determine paracetamol in urine samples: After hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid, 4-aminophenol reacts in ammonia solution with a phenol derivate, e.g. salicylic acid, to form an indophenol dye under oxidization by air. == History == Acetanilide was the first aniline derivative serendipitously found to possess analgesic as well as antipyretic properties, and was quickly introduced into medical practice under the name of Antifebrin by Cahn & Hepp in 1886. But its unacceptable toxic effects—the most alarming being cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia, an increase of hemoglobin in its ferric [Fe3+] state, called methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen, and thus decreases overall carriage of oxygen to tissue—prompted the search for less toxic aniline derivatives. Some reports state that Cahn & Hepp or a French chemist called Charles Gerhardt first synthesized paracetamol in 1852. Harmon Northrop Morse synthesized paracetamol at Johns Hopkins University via the reduction of p-nitrophenol with tin in glacial acetic acid in 1877, but it was not until 1887 that clinical pharmacologist Joseph von Mering tried paracetamol on humans. In 1893, von Mering published a paper reporting on the clinical results of paracetamol with phenacetin, another aniline derivative. Von Mering claimed that, unlike phenacetin, paracetamol had a slight tendency to produce methemoglobinemia. Paracetamol was then quickly discarded in favor of phenacetin. The sales of phenacetin established Bayer as a leading pharmaceutical company. Von Mering's claims remained essentially unchallenged for half a century until two teams of researchers from the United States analyzed the metabolism of acetanilide and phenacetin. In 1947, David Lester and Leon Greenberg found strong evidence that paracetamol was a major metabolite of acetanilide in human blood, and in a subsequent study they reported that large doses of paracetamol given to albino rats did not cause methemoglobinemia. In 1948, Bernard Brodie, Julius Axelrod and Frederick Flinn confirmed that paracetamol was the major metabolite of acetanilide in humans, and established that it was just as efficacious an analgesic as its precursor. They also suggested that methemoglobinemia is produced in humans mainly by another metabolite, phenylhydroxylamine. A follow-up paper by Brodie and Axelrod in 1949 established that phenacetin was also metabolized to paracetamol. This led to a ""rediscovery"" of paracetamol. Paracetamol was first marketed in the United States in 1950 under the name Trigesic, a combination of paracetamol, aspirin, and caffeine. Reports in 1951 of three users stricken with the blood disease agranulocytosis led to its removal from the marketplace, and it took several years until it became clear that the disease was unconnected. The following year, 1952, paracetamol returned to the U.S. market as a prescription drug. In the United Kingdom, marketing of paracetamol began in 1956 by Sterling-Winthrop Co. as Panadol, available only by prescription, and promoted as preferable to aspirin since it was safe for children and people with ulcers. In 1963, paracetamol was added to the British Pharmacopoeia, and has gained popularity since then as an analgesic agent with few side-effects and little interaction with other pharmaceutical agents. Concerns about paracetamol's safety delayed its widespread acceptance until the 1970s, but in the 1980s paracetamol sales exceeded those of aspirin in many countries, including the United Kingdom. This was accompanied by the commercial demise of phenacetin, blamed as the cause of analgesic nephropathy and hematological toxicity. Available in the U.S. without a prescription since 1955 (1960, according to another source), paracetamol has become a common household drug. In 1988, Sterling Winthrop was acquired by Eastman Kodak which sold the over the counter drug rights to SmithKline Beecham in 1994. In June 2009, an FDA advisory committee recommended that new restrictions be placed on paracetamol use in the United States to help protect people from the potential toxic effects. The maximum single adult dosage would be decreased from 1000 mg to 650 mg, while combinations of paracetamol and other products would be prohibited. Committee members were particularly concerned by the fact that the then-present maximum dosages of paracetamol had been shown to produce alterations in liver function. In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of prescription combination products containing paracetamol to limit its amount to no more than 325 mg per tablet or capsule and began requiring manufacturers to update the labels of all prescription combination paracetamol products to warn of the potential risk of severe liver damage. Manufacturers had three years to limit the amount of paracetamol in their prescription drug products to 325 mg per dosage unit. In November 2011, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency revised UK dosing of liquid paracetamol for children. In September 2013, ""Use Only as Directed"", an episode of the radio program This American Life highlighted deaths from paracetamol overdose. This report was followed by two reports by ProPublica alleging that the ""FDA has long been aware of studies showing the risks of acetaminophen. So has the maker of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a division of Johnson & Johnson"" and ""McNeil, the maker of Tylenol, ... has repeatedly opposed safety warnings, dosage restrictions and other measures meant to safeguard users of the drug."" == Society and culture == === Naming === Paracetamol is the Australian Approved Name and British Approved Name as well as the international nonproprietary name used by the WHO and in many other countries; acetaminophen is the United States Adopted Name and Japanese Accepted Name and also the name generally used in Canada, Venezuela, Colombia, and Iran. Both paracetamol and acetaminophen are contractions of chemical names for the compound. The word ""paracetamol"" is a shortened form of para-acetylaminophenol, and was coined by Frederick Stearns & Co in 1956, while the word ""acetaminophen"" is a shortened form of N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP), which was coined and first marketed by McNeil Laboratories in 1955. The initialism APAP is used by dispensing pharmacists in the United States. === Available forms === Paracetamol is available in oral, suppository, and intravenous forms. Intravenous paracetamol is sold under the brand name Ofirmev in the United States. In some formulations, paracetamol is combined with the opiate codeine, sometimes referred to as co-codamol (BAN) and Panadeine in Australia. In the U.S., this combination is available only by prescription. As of 1 February 2018, medications containing codeine also became prescription-only in Australia. Paracetamol is also combined with other opioids such as dihydrocodeine, referred to as co-dydramol (British Approved Name (BAN)), oxycodone or hydrocodone. Another very commonly used analgesic combination includes paracetamol in combination with propoxyphene napsylate. A combination of paracetamol, codeine, and the doxylamine succinate is also available. Paracetamol is sometimes combined with phenylephrine hydrochloride. Sometimes a third active ingredient, such as ascorbic acid, caffeine, chlorpheniramine maleate, or guaifenesin is added to this combination. == Research == Claims that paracetamol is an effective analgesic medication to treat symptoms of COVID-19 were found to be unsubstantiated. == Veterinary use == === Cats === Paracetamol is extremely toxic to cats, which lack the necessary UGT1A6 enzyme to detoxify it. Initial symptoms include vomiting, salivation, and discoloration of the tongue and gums. Unlike an overdose in humans, liver damage is rarely the cause of death; instead, methemoglobin formation and the production of Heinz bodies in red blood cells inhibit oxygen transport by the blood, causing asphyxiation (methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia). Treatment of the toxicosis with acetylcysteine is recommended. === Dogs === Paracetamol has been reported to be as effective as aspirin in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in dogs. A paracetamol–codeine product (brand name Pardale-V) licensed for use in dogs is available for purchase under supervision of a vet, pharmacist or other qualified person. It should be administered to dogs only on veterinary advice and with extreme caution. The main effect of toxicity in dogs is liver damage, and GI ulceration has been reported. Acetylcysteine treatment is efficacious in dogs when administered within two hours of paracetamol ingestion. === Snakes === Paracetamol is lethal to snakes and has been suggested as a chemical control program for the invasive brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) in Guam. Doses of 80 mg are inserted into dead mice that are scattered by helicopter as lethal bait to be consumed by the snakes. == Notes == == References == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.147242e-06, 'ICAL': 0.0}
459	N-acetyl-l-methionine	PUBMED	 Methionine plays a vital role in protein synthesis, and regulation of antioxidant response in ruminants. This study aimed to assess the effects of dietary supplementation with N-acetyl-l-methionine (NALM), which serves a source of rumen-protected methionine, on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and oxidative stability. Sixty Angus heifers (initial body weight = 408 ± 51.2 kg, 15-18 months) were stratified by body weight and randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: a control group (0% NALM), and experimental groups receiving diets containing 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.50% NALM (dry matter (DM) basis), respectively. The experiment included a 2-week adaptation and a 22-week data and sample collection period. Results indicated that blood urea nitrogen in the plasma of the 0.25% NALM group was lower compared to the control and the 0.50% NALM groups (P = 0.02). The plasma methionine (P = 0.04), proline (P < 0.01), and tryptophan (P = 0.05) were higher in the 0.25% and 0.50% NALM groups, as well as the methionine and proline in the muscle of the 0.25% NALM group (P < 0.01). The muscle pH (P < 0.01) was increased by supplementing 0.25% and 0.50% NALM in diets but decreased the lactate (P < 0.01). The 0.25% NALM group also increased a* (P = 0.05), decreased L* (P = 0.05), drip loss (P = 0.01), and glycolytic potential in the muscle (P < 0.01). The total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione in muscle of 0.25% NALM group were higher than that of the control (P < 0.01), and the malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were lower (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the dietary supplement with NALM improves meat quality by enhancing the antioxidant effect of lipids and proteins. Neutral amino acids can be delivered into cells through the l-type amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1), which is a sodium independent transporter. The LAT1 protein is expressed in different tissues, including kidney, blood brain barrier and intestinal wall hence LAT1 can be used as a target in diseases associated with its overexpression. In-silico interactions between different ligands, including methionine (Met), N-acetyl-l-methionine (AcMet), hyaluronic acid (HA), grafted hyaluronic-acid l-methionine (HA-ADH-Met) and a novel grafted hyaluronic acid-N-acetyl-l-methionine (HA-ADH-AcMet), which are at the active site of the LAT1 transporter, were studied and the binding energies calculated. The HA-ADH-AcMet complex demonstrated binding energy and solvation energy of -74.84 and 81.46 kcal/mol, respectively, thus validating its potential to be synthesized. The structural conformation of the HA-ADH-AcMet was confirmed using  Two experiments were conducted to investigate the production effects of N-acetyl-l-methionine (NALM; experiment 1) and to estimate its bioavailability (BA) and rumen escape (RE; experiment 2), respectively, in lactating dairy cows. In experiment 1, 18 multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated, 3 × 3 Latin square design experiment with three 28-d periods. Treatments were (1) basal diet estimated to supply 45 g/d digestible Met (dMet) or 1.47% of metabolizable protein (MP; control), (2) basal diet top-dressed with 32 g/d of NALM to achieve dMet supply of 2.2% of MP, and (3) basal diet top-dressed with 56 g/d of NALM to achieve dMet supply of 2.6% of MP. The NALM treatments supplied estimated 17 and 29 g/d dMet from NALM, respectively, based on manufacturer's specifications. In experiment 2, 4 rumen-cannulated lactating Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment with four 12-d periods. A 12-d period for baseline data collection and 4 d for determination of RE of NALM preceded the Latin square experiment. For determination of RE, 30 g of NALM were dosed into the rumen simultaneously with Cr-EDTA (used as a rumen fluid kinetics marker) and samples of ruminal contents were collected at 0 (before dosing), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 24 h after dosing. Rumen escape of NALM was calculated using the estimated passage rate based on the measured Cr rate of disappearance. Bioavailability of abomasally dosed NALM was determined using the area under the curve of plasma Met concentration technique. Two doses of l-Met (providing 7.5 and 15 g of dMet) and 2 doses of NALM (11.2 and 14.4 g of dMet) were separately pulse-dosed into the abomasum of the cows and blood was collected from the jugular vein for Met concentration analysis at 0 (before dosing), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24 h after dosing. Supplementation of NALM did not affect DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency, or milk protein and lactose concentrations and yields in experiment 1. Milk fat concentration and energy-corrected milk yield decreased linearly with NALM dose. Plasma Met concentration was not affected by NALM dose. The estimated relative BA of abomasally dosed NALM (experiment 2) was 50% when dosed at 14.4 g/cow (11.2 g/d dMet from NALM) and 24% when dosed at 28.8 g/cow (14.4 g/d dMet from NALM). The estimated RE of NALM was 19% based on the measured k	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -0.0036157512, 'OD': 0.0}
460	N-acetyl-l-arginine	PUBMED	 Previously, N-acetyl-l-arginine (NALA) suppressed the aggregation of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) more effectively and with a minimum decrease in transition temperature (T The spatial structure of methylamide N-acetyl-L-argine was studied taking into account the non-valent and electrostati interactions, the torsion energy, and the distorsion of valency angles. Calculation of the favourable conformations of the molecule was carried out with the use of all the combinations of angles phi, psi, chi1 divided by chi4 as an intital approximation. These correspond to the low energy forms of the main chain and to the minima of the torsion potentials of the side chain. Conformational possibilities of arginine and lysine were compared. The calculated stable conformation of N-acetyl-L-arginine-methylamide are compared with the geometry of arginine residues in the proteins with known structure.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -1.1756368e-05}
462	N-acetyl-l-tyrosine	PUBMED	" Under stress conditions, mitochondria release low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers a cytoprotective response, called ""mitohormesis"". It still remains unclear how mitochondria respond to stress-derived stimuli and release a low level of ROS. Here, we show that N-acetyl-l-tyrosine (NAT) functions as a plausible intrinsic factor responsible for these tasks in stressed animals. NAT is present in the blood or hemolymph of healthy animals, and its concentrations increase in response to heat stress. Pretreatment with NAT significantly increases the stress tolerance of tested insects and mice. Analyses using Drosophila larvae and cultured cells demonstrate that the hormetic effects are triggered by transient NAT-induced perturbation of mitochondria, which causes a small increase in ROS production and leads to sequential retrograde responses: NAT-dependent FoxO activation increases in the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and Keap1. Moreover, we find that NAT represses tumor growth, possibly via the activation of Keap1. In sum, we propose that NAT is a vital endogenous molecule that could serve as a triggering factor for mitohormesis. N-acetyl tyrosine (NAT) is hydroxylated by mushroom tyrosinase and the N-acetyl dopa formed is oxidized by the enzyme to N-acetyl dopaquinone (lambda max = 390 +/- 10 nm). H2O2 and NH2OH each shortened the lag period of NAT hydroxylation by the enzyme. H2O2 had an effect on the changes with time in the spectrum of product(s) formed and on the spectrum of the final product(s) obtained when NAT was hydroxylated by mushroom tyrosinase, in a manner suggesting that H2O2 converts N-acetyl dopaquinone to a pink-violet product(s) (lambda max = 490 nm), whereas such a product(s) was not formed in the absence of H2O2. A pink-violet product(s) (lambda max 490 +/- 20 nm) was also formed when NAT was hydroxylated by mushroom tyrosinase in the presence of NH2OH or para amino benzoic acid (PABA), probably as a result of an interaction between N-acetyl dopaquinone and NH2OH or PABA forming mono- or di-oximes. Kojic acid (5-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl)-4H-pyran-4-one) inhibited effectively the rate of NAT hydroxylation by mushroom tyrosinase in the absence or presence of H2O2. When NAT was oxidized by the enzyme in the absence of kojic acid, N-acetyl dopaquinone was formed at once and a shoulder at 490-530 nm appeared later. Under identical conditions but in the presence of kojic acid, a yellow product(s), characterized by a peak at 320 +/- 10 nm, was detected, suggesting that N-acetyl dopaquinone oxidizes kojic acid to the yellow product(s). Maltol (3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one), a gamma-pyrone derivative structurally related to kojic acid, also inhibited the rate of NAT hydroxylation by mushroom tyrosinase. The addition of maltol at the plateau phase of the reaction resulted in an immediate decline in absorbance at 400 nm, suggesting that maltol conjugates with N-acetyl dopaquinone, yielding a product(s) characterized by a lower extinction coefficient at 400 nm than that of N-acetyl dopaquinone alone. The final brown-red product(s) formed when NAT was hydroxylated by mushroom tyrosinase was bleached in the presence of ascorbic acid or H2O2. Utilization of N-acetyl-L-tyrosine and glycyl-L-tyrosine as a source of tyrosine in infusion solutions was tested in rats receiving total parenteral nutrition for 4 wk. The four solutions tested were isonitrogenous and isocaloric. One of the solutions contained an adequate amount of L-phenylalanine; in the other three, two-thirds of the phenylalanine was replaced by a corresponding amount of either glycine, glycyl-L-tyrosine or N-acetyl-L-tyrosine. No differences in weight gain or N-balance could be detected as a result of administering either the solution with glycyl-L-tyrosine or with N-acetyl-L-tyrosine in place of the solution containing an adequate phenylalanine content. The solution in which two-thirds of the L-phenylalanine was replaced by glycine yielded only half of the weight gain and correspondingly reduced values for N-balance. Daily urinary excretion rates for N-acetyl-L-tyrosine and glycyl-L-tyrosine were 11% and 0.5%, respectively, of the infused amount. Plasma amino acid pattern was affected differently by the four solutions. The results indicate that both N-acetyl-L-tyrosine and glycyl-L-tyrosine are efficiently utilized by the rat during total parenteral nutrition."

465	Protopanaxadiol	WIKIPEDIA	Protopanaxadiol (PPD) is an organic compound that is an aglycone of ginsenosides, a group of steroid glycosides. It is a dammarane-type tetracyclic terpene sapogenin found in ginseng (Panax ginseng) and in notoginseng (Panax pseudoginseng). The health effect of protopanaxadiol inside the human body is still unclear. One study suggests it has rapid, non-genomic effects on endothelial cells, binding to the glucocorticoid and oestrogen beta receptors. The study also showed an increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration. Shanghai Innovative Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SIRC-TCM) is trying to develop an antidepressant based on this substance under the brand name Yoxintine. The drug has finished phase II trials as of May 2023. Results were published in November 2024. A pharmacokinetic study done on phase IIa human volunteers reports the relationship between oral dose and blood plasma concentration, but no data is given for oral bioavailbility, half life, or volume of distribution. In rats, the oral bioavailbility is about 48% and the half-life is 6.25 hours when given as an extract containing both PPD and PPT. When given alone, reported bioavailbility values are lower, at 20.7–36.8%. == See also == Protopanaxatriol == References ==	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.0002755174, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07, ',': -1.504853e-06, ' FOOD': -9.4914985e-06}
469	Paroxetine	WIKIPEDIA	"Paroxetine, sold under the brand name Paxil among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It has also been used in the treatment of premature ejaculation and hot flashes due to menopause. It is taken orally (by mouth). Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, trouble sleeping, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. It is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of the chemical serotonin by neurons in the brain. Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. In 2018, it was in the top 10 of most prescribed antidepressants in the United States. == Medical uses == Paroxetine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It is also occasionally used for agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and menopausal hot flashes. === Depression === A variety of meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of paroxetine in depression. They have variously concluded that paroxetine is superior or equivalent to placebo and that it is equivalent to other antidepressants. Despite this, there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any point in time. === Anxiety disorders === Paroxetine was the first antidepressant approved in the United States for the treatment of panic disorder. Several studies have concluded that paroxetine is superior to placebo in the treatment of panic disorder. Paroxetine has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults and children. It is also beneficial for people with co-occurring social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. It appears to be similar to a number of other SSRIs. Paroxetine is used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comparative efficacy of paroxetine is equivalent to that of clomipramine and venlafaxine. Paroxetine is also effective for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Paroxetine is approved for the treatment of PTSD in the United States, Japan, and Europe. In the United States, it is approved for short-term use. Paroxetine is also FDA-approved for generalized anxiety disorder. === Menopausal hot flashes === In 2013, low-dose paroxetine was approved in the US for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause. At the low dose used for menopausal hot flashes, side effects are similar to placebo and dose tapering is not required for discontinuation. === Fibromyalgia === Studies have also shown paroxetine ""appears to be well-tolerated and improve the overall symptomatology in patients with fibromyalgia"", but is less robust in helping with the pain involved. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndromes may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. Paroxetine shares many of the common adverse effects of SSRIs, including (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%) diarrhea 12% (8%) constipation 14% (9%) dry mouth 18% (12%) somnolence 23% (9%) insomnia 13% (6%) headache 18% (17%) hypomania 1% (0.3%) blurred vision 4% (1%) loss of appetite 6% (2%) nervousness 5% (3%) paraesthesia 4% (2%) dizziness 13% (6%) asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)) tremor 8% (2%) sweating 11% (2%) sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, but a higher incidence of anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain. Due to reports of adverse withdrawal reactions upon terminating treatment, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use at the European Medicines Agency recommends gradually reducing over several weeks or months if the decision to withdraw is made. See also Discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal). Mania or hypomania may occur in 1% of patients with depression and up to 12% of patients with bipolar disorder. This side effect can occur in individuals with no history of mania, but it may be more likely to occur in those with bipolar disorder or with a family history of mania. Paroxetine is described as a 'hepatoxic agent' and has been associated with hepatoxicity and jaundice. === Suicide === Like other antidepressants, paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in people under the age of 25. The FDA conducted a statistical analysis of paroxetine clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004 and found an increase in suicidality and ideation as compared to placebo, which was observed in trials for both depression and anxiety disorders. In 2015 a paper published in The BMJ that reanalysed the original case notes argued that in Study 329, assessing paroxetine and imipramine against placebo in adolescents with depression, the incidence of suicidal behavior had been under-reported and the efficacy exaggerated for paroxetine. === Sexual dysfunction === Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, anorgasmia, lack of vaginal lubrication, and erectile dysfunction, is one of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with paroxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is higher than 70%. Symptoms of sexual dysfunction have been reported to persist after discontinuing SSRIs, although this is thought to be occasional. === Pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including paroxetine) is associated with shorter duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g or 2.6 oz), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that for pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant, paroxetine ""be avoided, if possible"", as it may be associated with increased risk of birth defects. Babies born to women who used paroxetine during the first trimester have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations, primarily ventricular and atrial septal defects. Unless the benefits of paroxetine justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to stopping or switching to another antidepressant. Paroxetine use during pregnancy is associated with about 1.5– to 1.7-fold increase in congenital birth defects, in particular, heart defects, cleft lip and palate, clubbed feet, or any birth defects. === Discontinuation syndrome === Many psychoactive medications can cause withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation from administration. Paroxetine has among the highest incidence rates and severity of withdrawal syndrome of any medication of its class. Common withdrawal symptoms for paroxetine include nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and vertigo; insomnia, nightmares, and vivid dreams; feelings of electricity in the body, as well as rebound depression and anxiety. A liquid formulation of paroxetine is available and allows a very gradual decrease of the dose, which may prevent discontinuation syndrome. Another recommendation is to temporarily switch to fluoxetine, which has a longer half-life and thus decreases the severity of discontinuation syndrome. In 2002, the U.S. FDA published a warning regarding ""severe"" discontinuation symptoms among those terminating paroxetine treatment, including paraesthesia, nightmares, and dizziness. The agency also warned of case reports describing agitation, sweating, and nausea. In connection with a Glaxo spokesperson's statement that withdrawal reactions occur only in 0.2% of patients and are ""mild and short-lived"", the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations said GSK had breached two of the federation's codes of practice. Paroxetine prescribing information posted at GlaxoSmithKline has been updated related to the occurrence of a discontinuation syndrome, including serious discontinuation symptoms. == Overdose == Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia, and seizures. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of paroxetine may be measured to monitor therapeutic administration, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Plasma paroxetine concentrations are generally in a range of 40–400 μg/L in persons receiving daily therapeutic doses and 200–2,000 μg/L in poisoned patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 1–4 mg/L in acute lethal overdose situations. Along with the other SSRIs, sertraline and fluoxetine, paroxetine is considered a low-risk drug in cases of overdose. == Interactions == Interactions with other drugs acting on the serotonin system or impairing the metabolism of serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reaction. Such reactions have been observed with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, but particularly with concurrent use of triptans, MAO inhibitors, antipsychotics, or other dopamine antagonists. The prescribing information states that paroxetine should ""not be used in combination with an MAOI (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI"", and should not be used in combination with pimozide, thioridazine, tryptophan, or warfarin. Paroxetine interacts with the following cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP2D6 for which it is both a substrate and a potent inhibitor. CYP2B6 (strong) inhibitor. CYP3A4 (weak) inhibitor. CYP1A2 (weak) inhibitor. CYP2C9 (weak) inhibitor. CYP2C19 (weak) inhibitor. Paroxetine has been shown to be an inhibitor of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Paroxetine is the most potent and one of the most specific selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It also binds to the allosteric site of the serotonin transporter, similarly to escitalopram, though less potently so. Paroxetine also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine to a lesser extent (<50 nmol/L). Based on evidence from four weeks of administration in rats, the equivalent of 20 mg paroxetine taken once daily occupies approximately 88% of serotonin transporters in the prefrontal cortex. Paroxetine is a phenylpiperidine and might have some affinity for opioid receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Paroxetine is well-absorbed following oral administration. It has an absolute bioavailability of about 50%, with evidence of a saturable first pass effect. When taken orally, it achieves maximum concentration in about 6–10 hours and reaches steady-state in 7–14 days. Paroxetine exhibits significant interindividual variations in volume of distribution and clearance. Less than 2% of an oral dose is excreted in urine unchanged. Paroxetine is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2D6. == Society and culture == Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. GlaxoSmithKline has paid substantial fines, paid settlements in class-action lawsuits, and become the subject of several highly critical books about its marketing of paroxetine, in particular, the off-label marketing of paroxetine for children, the suppression of negative research results relating to its use in children, and allegations that it failed to warn consumers of substantial withdrawal effects associated with the use of the drug. === Marketing === In 2004, GSK agreed to settle charges of consumer fraud for $2.5 million. The legal discovery process also uncovered evidence of deliberate, systematic suppression of unfavorable Paxil research results. One of GSK's internal documents read, ""It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy [in children] had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine"". In 2012, the United States Department of Justice fined GlaxoSmithKline $3 billion for withholding data, unlawfully promoting use in those under 18, and preparing an article that misleadingly reported the effects of paroxetine in adolescents with depression following its clinical trial study 329. In February 2016, the UK Competition and Markets Authority imposed record fines of £45 million on companies that were found to have infringed European Union and UK Competition law by entering into agreements to delay the market entry of generic versions of the drug in the UK. GlaxoSmithKline received the bulk of the fines, being fined £37,600,757. Other companies that produce generics were issued fines which collectively total £7,384,146. UK public health services are likely to claim damages for being overcharged in the period where the generic versions of the drug were illegally blocked from the market, as the generics are over 70% less expensive. GlaxoSmithKline may also face actions from other generic manufacturers who incurred losses as a result of the anticompetitive conduct. In April 2016, appeals were lodged with the Competition Appeal Tribunal by the companies which were fined. GSK marketed paroxetine through television advertisements in the 1990s and 2000s. Commercials also aired for the CR version of the drug beginning in 2003. === Economics === In 2007, paroxetine was ranked 94th on the list of bestselling drugs, with over $1 billion in sales. In 2006, paroxetine was the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. retail market, with more than 19.7 million prescriptions. In 2007, sales had dropped slightly to 18.1 million but paroxetine remained the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. === Brand names === Brand names include Aropax, Paretin, Brisdelle, Deroxat, Paxil, Pexeva, Paxtine, Paxetin, Paroxat, Paraxyl, Sereupin, Daparox and Seroxat. == Research == Several studies have suggested that paroxetine can be used in the treatment of premature ejaculation. In particular, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was found to increase 6- to 13-fold, which was somewhat longer than the delay achieved by the treatment with other SSRIs (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram). However, paroxetine taken acutely (""on demand"") 3–10 hours before coitus resulted only in a ""clinically irrelevant and sexually unsatisfactory"" 1.5-fold delay of ejaculation and was inferior to clomipramine, which induced a fourfold delay. There is also evidence that paroxetine may be effective in the treatment of compulsive gambling and hot flashes. Benefits of paroxetine prescription for diabetic neuropathy or chronic tension headache are uncertain. Although the evidence is conflicting, paroxetine may be effective for the treatment of dysthymia, a chronic disorder involving depressive symptoms for most days of the year. There is evidence to support that paroxetine selectively binds to and inhibits G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in mice with heart failure. Since GRK2 regulates the activity of the beta adrenergic receptor, which becomes desensitized in cases of heart failure, paroxetine (or a paroxetine derivative) could be used as a heart failure treatment in the future. Paroxetine has been identified as a potential disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug. == Veterinary use == Paroxetine may be useful in the treatment of canine or feline behavioral diagnoses and is effective in the treatment of social anxiety, depression, and agitation associated with depression. == Other organisms == Paroxetine is a common finding in wastewater. It is highly toxic to the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (syn. Raphidocelis subcapitata). It also is toxic to the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Alberca et al., 2016 found that paroxetine acts as a trypanocide against T. cruzi. Alberca et al., 2016 finds a leishmanicide effect. Alberca finds that paroxetine produces cell death of the promastigotes of L. infantum. The mechanism of action remains unknown. Various types of bacteria can break down paroxetine in the environment. These include, for example Pseudomonas sp., Bosea sp., Shewanella sp., Species of Chitinophagaceae and Acinetobacter sp. == References == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
470	Trazodone	WIKIPEDIA	"Trazodone, sold under many brand names, is an antidepressant medication, used to treat major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and insomnia. It is a phenylpiperazine compound of the serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) class. The medication is taken orally. Common side effects include dry mouth, feeling faint, vomiting, and headache. More serious side effects may include suicide, mania, irregular heart rate, and pathologically prolonged erections. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Trazodone also has sedating effects. Trazodone was approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the eighteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 27 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Depression === The primary use of trazodone is the treatment of unipolar major depression with or without anxiety. Data from open and double-blind trials suggest that the antidepressant efficacy of trazodone is comparable to that of amitriptyline, doxepin, and mianserin. Furthermore, trazodone has shown anxiolytic properties, low cardiotoxicity, and relatively mild side effects. Because trazodone has minimal anticholinergic activity, it was especially welcomed as a treatment for geriatric patients with depression when it first became available. Three double-blind studies reported trazodone had antidepressant efficacy similar to that of other antidepressants in geriatric patients. Unfortunately, a side effect of trazodone, orthostatic hypotension, which may cause dizziness and increase the risk of falling, can have devastating consequences for elderly patients. Therefore, this side effect, along with sedation, often makes trazodone less acceptable for this population compared to newer compounds that share its lack of anticholinergic activity (but not the rest of its side effect profile). Still, trazodone is often helpful for geriatric patients with depression who have severe agitation and insomnia. Trazodone is usually used at a dosage of 150 to 300 mg/day for the treatment of depression. Lower doses have also been used to augment other antidepressants or when initiating therapy. Higher doses, up to 600 mg/day, have been used in more severe cases of depression (in hospitalized patients, for example). Trazodone is usually administered multiple times per day, but once-daily administration may be similarly effective. === Insomnia === Low-dose trazodone is used off-label in the treatment of insomnia and is considered to be effective and safe for this indication. It may also be used to treat antidepressant-related insomnia. Trazodone was the second-most prescribed agent for insomnia in the early 2000s even though most studies of trazodone for the treatment of sleep disturbances have been in depressed individuals. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in the late 2010s, including a Cochrane review, found low-dose trazodone to be an effective medication for short-term treatment of insomnia in both depressed and euthymic people. Trazodone slightly improves subjective sleep quality (SMDTooltip standardized mean difference = –0.34 to –0.41) and reduces the number of nighttime awakenings (MD = –0.31, SMD = –0.51), on average. Conversely, it does not appear to affect sleep onset, total sleep time, time awake after sleep onset, or sleep efficiency. It appears to increase deep sleep—in contrast to certain other hypnotics. The quality of evidence of trazodone for short-term treatment of insomnia was rated as low to moderate. There is no evidence available at present to inform the long-term use of trazodone in the treatment of insomnia. The benefits of trazodone for insomnia must be weighed against potential adverse effects, such as morning grogginess, daytime sleepiness, cognitive and motor impairment, and postural hypotension, among others. Quality safety data on the use of trazodone as a sleep aid are currently lacking. Trazodone is used at low doses in the range of 50 to 150 mg/day for insomnia. Higher doses of 200 to 600 mg/day have also been studied. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of trazodone in the treatment of insomnia due to inadequate evidence and due to harms potentially outweighing benefits. === Other disorders === Trazodone is often used in the treatment of anxiety disorders — such as generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder — as well as in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Trazodone is often used as an alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, use of trazodone in anxiety disorders is off-label and evidence of its effectiveness for these indications is variable and limited. Benefits for OCD appear to be mild. Trazodone has been used to treat sleep disturbances and nightmares in PTSD. === Combination with other antidepressants === Trazodone is often used in combination with other antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in order to augment their antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and to reduce side effects such as sexual dysfunction, anxiety, and insomnia. === Available forms === Trazodone is provided as the hydrochloride salt and is available in the form of 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg oral tablets. In Italy, it is also available as an oral solution (Trittico 60 mg/mL) with a dosing pipette marked at 25 mg and 50 mg. An extended-release oral tablet formulation at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg is also available. == Side effects == Because of its lack of anticholinergic side effects, trazodone is especially useful in situations in which antimuscarinic effects are particularly problematic (e.g., in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, closed-angle glaucoma, or severe constipation). Trazodone's propensity to cause sedation is a dual-edged sword. For many patients, the relief from agitation, anxiety, and insomnia can be rapid; for other patients, including those individuals with considerable psychomotor retardation and feelings of low energy, therapeutic doses of trazodone may not be tolerable because of sedation. Trazodone elicits orthostatic hypotension in some people, probably as a consequence of α1-adrenergic receptor blockade. The unmasking of bipolar disorder may occur with trazodone and other antidepressants. Precautions for trazodone include known hypersensitivity to trazodone and under 18 years and combined with other antidepressant medications, it may increase the possibility of suicidal thoughts or actions. While trazodone is not a true member of the SSRI class of antidepressants, it does still share many properties of SSRIs, especially the possibility of discontinuation syndrome if the medication is stopped too quickly. Care must, therefore, be taken when coming off the medication, usually by a gradual process of tapering down the dose over some time. === Suicide === Antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children and young adults. Close monitoring for the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is thus recommended. === Sedation === Since trazodone may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as operating an automobile or machinery, the patient should be cautioned not to engage in such activities while impaired. Compared to the reversible MAOI antidepressant drug moclobemide, more impairment of vigilance occurs with trazodone. Trazodone has been found to impair driving ability. === Cardiac === Case reports have noted cardiac arrhythmias emerging in relation to trazodone treatment, both in patients with pre-existing mitral valve prolapse and in patients with negative personal and family histories of cardiac disease. QT prolongation has been reported with trazodone therapy. Arrhythmia identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, and in two patients short episodes (three to four beats) of ventricular tachycardia. Several post-marketing reports have been made of arrhythmia in trazodone-treated patients who have pre-existing cardiac disease and in some patients who did not have pre-existing cardiac disease. Until the results of prospective studies are available, patients with pre-existing cardiac disease should be closely monitored, particularly for cardiac arrhythmias. Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Concomitant administration of drugs that prolong the QT interval or that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. === Priapism === A relatively rare side effect associated with trazodone is priapism, likely due to its antagonism at α-adrenergic receptors. More than 200 cases have been reported, and the manufacturer estimated that the incidence of any abnormal erectile function is about one in 6,000 male patients treated with trazodone. The risk for this side effect appears to be greatest during the first month of treatment at low dosages (i.e. <150 mg/day). Early recognition of any abnormal erectile function is important, including prolonged or inappropriate erections, and should prompt discontinuation of trazodone treatment. Spontaneous orgasms have also been reported with trazodone in men. Clinical reports have described trazodone-associated psychosexual side effects in women as well, including increased libido, priapism of the clitoris, and spontaneous orgasms. === Others === Rare cases of liver toxicity have been observed, possibly due to the formation of reactive metabolites. Elevated prolactin concentrations have been observed in people taking trazodone. They appear to be increased by around 1.5- to 2-fold. Studies on trazodone and cognitive function are mixed, with some finding improvement, others finding no change and some finding impairment. Trazodone does not seem to worsen periodic limb movements during sleep. Trazodone is associated with an increased risk of falls in older adults. It has also been associated with increased risk of hip fractures in older adults. === Pregnancy and lactation === Sufficient data in humans are lacking. Use should be justified by the severity of the condition to be treated. == Overdose == There are reported cases of high doses of trazodone precipitating serotonin syndrome. There are also reports of patients taking multiple SSRIs with trazodone and precipitating serotonin syndrome. Trazodone appears to be relatively safer than TCAs, MAOIs, and a few of the other second-generation antidepressants in overdose situations, especially when it is the only agent taken. Fatalities are rare, and uneventful recoveries have been reported after ingestion of doses as high as 6,000–9,200 mg. In one report, 9 of 294 cases of overdose were fatal, and all nine patients had also taken other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. When trazodone overdoses occur, clinicians should carefully monitor for low blood pressure, a potentially serious toxic effect. In a report of a fatal trazodone overdose, torsades de pointes and complete atrioventricular block developed, along with subsequent multiple organ failure, with a trazodone plasma concentration of 25.4 mg/L on admission. == Interactions == === Cytochrome P450 inhibitors and inducers === Trazodone is metabolized by several liver enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2. Its active metabolite meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) is known to be formed by CYP3A4 and metabolized by CYP2D6. Inhibition or induction of the aforementioned enzymes by various other substances may alter the metabolism of trazodone and/or mCPP, leading to increased and/or decreased blood concentrations. The enzymes in question are known to be inhibited and induced by many medications, herbs, and foods, and as such, trazodone may interact with these substances. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, and ritonavir may lead to increased concentrations of trazodone and decreased concentrations of mCPP, while CYP3A4 inducers like carbamazepine, enzalutamide, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and St. John's wort may result in decreased trazodone concentrations and increased mCPP concentrations. CYP2D6 inhibitors may result in increased concentrations of both trazodone and mCPP, while CYP2D6 inducers may decrease their concentrations. Examples of potent CYP2D6 inhibitors include bupropion, cannabidiol, duloxetine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, and ritonavir, while CYP2D6 inducers include dexamethasone, glutethimide, and haloperidol. CYP1A2 inhibitors may increase trazodone concentrations, while CYP1A2 inducers may decrease trazodone concentrations. Examples of potent CYP1A2 inhibitors include ethinylestradiol (found in hormonal birth control), fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), fluvoxamine, and St. John's wort, while potent CYP1A2 inducers include phenytoin, rifampin, ritonavir, and tobacco. A study found that ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor and moderate CYP1A2 inducer, increased trazodone peak levels by 1.4-fold, trazodone area-under-the-curve levels by 2.4-fold, and decreased trazodone clearance by 50%. This was associated with adverse effects such as nausea, hypotension, and syncope. Another study found that the strong CYP3A4 inducer carbamazepine reduced concentrations of trazodone by 60 to 74%. The strong CYP2D6 inhibitor thioridazine has been reported to increase trazodone levels by 1.4-fold and concentrations of mCPP by 1.5-fold. Fluoxetine, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a weak or moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, has been reported to increase levels of trazodone by 1.3- to 1.7-fold and of mCPP by 3.0- to 3.4-fold. Conversely, CYP2D6 genotype has not been found to predict trazodone or mCPP concentrations with trazodone therapy, although CYP2D6 genotype did correlate with side effects like dizziness and prolonged corrected QT interval. Smokers have lower levels of trazodone and higher ratios of mCPP to trazodone. Trazodone levels were 30% lower in smokers and mCPP to trazodone ratio was 1.3-fold higher in smokers, whereas mCPP concentrations were not different between smokers and non-smokers. Smoking is known to induce CYP1A2, and this may be involved in these findings. === Serotonergic agents and serotonin syndrome === Combination of trazodone with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) has a theoretical risk of serotonin syndrome. However, trazodone has been studied in combination with SSRIs and seemed to be safe in this context. On the other hand, cases of excessive sedation and serotonin syndrome have been reported with a combination of trazodone and fluoxetine or paroxetine. This may be due to the combined potentiation of the serotonin system. On the other hand, it may be related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes by fluoxetine and paroxetine and consequently increased trazodone and mCPP levels. === Antagonism of serotonergic psychedelics === Serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin are thought to mediate their halucinogenic effects by activating serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. By displacing them from the 5-HT2A receptor, serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists can block the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics. Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists like ketanserin and risperidone have been found to fully block or dose-dependently reduce the subjective effects of LSD and psilocybin in clinical studies. Trazodone is a potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and may have similar effects. Studies have estimated that trazodone occupies 90 to 97% of 5-HT2A receptors at doses of 50 to 200 mg/day. Trazodone is less studied in blocking the effects of serotonergic psychedelics than other serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists like ketanserin and risperidone, but was reported to reduce the effects of LSD in one published case report. Specifically, a woman on trazodone 200 mg/day who received a ""moderate"" dose of LSD was reported to have had reduced LSD-related hallucinogenic and physiological effects. Additionally, trazodone has been used and discussed extensively online as a so-called ""trip killer"" by recreational psychedelic users. It was recommended on the social media website Reddit for such purposes 77 times by 2024 with a suggested dose range of 50 to 150 mg. Trazodone was one of the most commonly recommended drugs for such purposes, exceeded only by alprazolam, benzodiazepines generally, and quetiapine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Trazodone is a mixed agonist and antagonist of various serotonin receptors, antagonist of adrenergic receptors, weak histamine H1 receptor antagonist, and weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. More specifically, it is an antagonist of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, a partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor, and an antagonist of the α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors. It is also a ligand of the 5-HT2C receptor with lower affinity than for the 5-HT2A receptor. However, it is unknown whether trazodone acts as a full agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist of the 5-HT2C receptor. Trazodone is a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist similarly to buspirone and tandospirone but with comparatively greater intrinsic activity. A range of weak affinities (Ki) have been reported for trazodone at the human histamine H1 receptor, including 220 nM, 350 nM, 500 nM, and 1,100 nM. Trazodone has a minor active metabolite known as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), and this metabolite may contribute to some degree to the pharmacological properties of trazodone. In contrast to trazodone, mCPP is an agonist of various serotonin receptors. It has relatively low affinity for α1-adrenergic receptors unlike trazodone, but does high affinity for α2-adrenergic receptors and weak affinity for the H1 receptor. In addition to direct interactions with serotonin receptors, mCPP is a serotonin releasing agent similarly to agents like fenfluramine and MDMA. In contrast to these serotonin releasing agents however, mCPP does not appear to cause long-term serotonin depletion (a property thought to be related to serotonergic neurotoxicity). Trazodone's 5-HT2A receptor antagonism and weak serotonin reuptake inhibition form the basis of its common label as an antidepressant of the serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) type. ==== Target occupancy studies ==== Studies have estimated occupancy of target sites by trazodone based on trazodone concentrations in blood and brain and on the affinities of trazodone for the human targets in question. Roughly half of brain 5-HT2A receptors are blocked by 1 mg of trazodone and essentially all 5-HT2A receptors are saturated at 10 mg of trazodone, but the clinically effective hypnotic doses of trazodone are in the 25–100 mg range. The occupancy of the serotonin transporter (SERT) by trazodone is estimated to be 86% at 100 mg/day and 90% at 150 mg/day. Trazodone may almost completely occupy the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors at doses of 100 to 150 mg/day. Significant occupancy of a number of other sites may also occur. However, another study estimated much lower occupancy of the SERT and 5-HT2A receptors by trazodone. ==== Effects in preclinical studies ==== Trazodone shows antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in animals. However, it shows differences from certain other antidepressants, like the tricyclic antidepressants, in animals. For example, it does not reverse the behavioral effects of the monoamine depleting agent reserpine and does not potentiate the effects of amphetamine or levodopa. Similarly to antipsychotics, trazodone reduces spontaneous motor activity, spontaneous and elicited aggressive behavior, and exploratory behavior, among other effects. In addition, trazodone diminishes amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity, although it does not inhibit apomorphine- or amphetamine-induced stereotypy. On the other hand, unlike antipsychotics, trazodone does not produce catalepsy, although it can do so at sufficiently high doses. Activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor enhances striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission, while stimulation of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor inhibits striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Trazodone is both a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, but has about 15-fold greater potency as an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor relative to the 5-HT2C receptor. In addition, at higher doses, trazodone acts as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist in animals. As a result of the preceding actions, trazodone may inhibit striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission. This may underlie exacerbation of parkinsonism seen in marmosets and in human case reports. ==== Correspondence to clinical effects ==== Trazodone may act predominantly as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist to mediate its therapeutic benefits against anxiety and depression. Its inhibitory effects on serotonin reuptake and 5-HT2C receptors are comparatively weak. In relation to these properties, trazodone does not have similar properties to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is not particularly associated with increased appetite and weight gain – unlike other 5-HT2C antagonists like mirtazapine. Moderate 5-HT1A partial agonism may contribute to trazodone's antidepressant and anxiolytic actions to some extent as well. The combined actions of 5-HT2A and 5HT2C receptor antagonism with serotonin reuptake inhibition only occur at moderate to high doses of trazodone. Doses of trazodone lower than those effective for antidepressant action are frequently used for the effective treatment of insomnia. Low doses exploit trazodone's potent actions as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and its properties as an antagonist of H1 and α1-adrenergic receptors, but do not adequately exploit its SERT or 5-HT2C inhibition properties, which are weaker. Since insomnia is one of the most frequent residual symptoms of depression after treatment with an SSRI, a hypnotic is often necessary for patients with a major depressive episode. Not only can a hypnotic potentially relieve the insomnia itself, but treating insomnia in patients with major depression may also increase remission rates due to the improvement of other symptoms such as loss of energy and depressed mood. Thus, the ability of low doses of trazodone to improve sleep in depressed patients may be an important mechanism whereby trazodone can augment the efficacy of other antidepressants. Trazodone's potent α1-adrenergic blockade may cause some side effects like orthostatic hypotension and sedation. Conversely, along with 5-HT2A and H1 receptor antagonism, it may contribute to its efficacy as a hypnotic. Trazodone lacks any affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, so does not produce anticholinergic side effects. mCPP, a non-selective serotonin receptor modulator and serotonin releasing agent, is an active metabolite of trazodone and has been suggested to possibly play a role in its therapeutic benefits. However, research has not supported this hypothesis and mCPP might actually antagonize the efficacy of trazodone as well as produce additional side effects. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Trazodone is well-absorbed after oral administration. Its bioavailability is 65 to 80%. Peak blood levels of trazodone occur 1 to 2 hours after ingestion and peak levels of the metabolite mCPP occur after 2 to 4 hours. Absorption is somewhat delayed and enhanced by food. ==== Distribution ==== Trazodone is not sequestered into any tissue. The medication is 89 to 95% protein-bound. The volume of distribution of trazodone is 0.8 to 1.5 L/kg. Trazodone is highly lipophilic. ==== Metabolism ==== The metabolic pathways involved in the metabolism are not well-characterized. In any case, the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 may all be involved to varying extents. Trazodone is known to be extensively metabolized by the liver via hydroxylation, N-oxidation, and N-dealkylation. Several metabolites of trazodone have been identified, including a dihydrodiol metabolite (via hydroxylation), a metabolite hydroxylated at the para position of the meta-chlorophenyl ring (via CYP2D6), oxotriazolepyridinepropionic acid (TPA) and mCPP (both via N-dealkylation of the piperazinyl nitrogen mediated by CYP3A4), and a metabolite formed by N-oxidation of the piperazinyl nitrogen. CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 genotypes all do not seem to predict concentrations of trazodone or mCPP. In any case, there are large interindividual variations in the metabolism of trazodone. In addition, poor metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 substrate, eliminate mCPP more slowly and have higher concentrations of mCPP than extensive metabolizers. mCPP is formed from trazodone by CYP3A4 and is metabolized via hydroxylation by CYP2D6 (to a para-hydroxylated metabolite). It may contribute to the pharmacological actions of trazodone. mCPP levels are only 10% of those of trazodone during therapy with trazodone, but is nonetheless present at concentrations known to produce psychic and physical effects in humans when mCPP has been administered alone. In any case, the actions of trazodone, such as its serotonin antagonism, might partially overwhelm those of mCPP. As a consequence of the production of mCPP as a metabolite, patients administered trazodone may test positive on EMIT II urine tests for the presence of MDMA (""ecstasy""). ==== Elimination ==== The elimination of trazodone is biphasic: the first phase's half-life (distribution) is 3 to 6 hours, and the following phase's half-life (elimination) is 4.1 to 14.6 hours. The elimination half-life of extended-release trazodone is 9.1 to 13.2 hours. The elimination half-life of mCPP is 2.6 to 16.0 hours and is longer than that of trazodone. Metabolites are conjugated to gluconic acid or glutathione and around 70 to 75% of 14C-labelled trazodone was found to be excreted in the urine within 72 hours. The remaining drug and its metabolites are excreted in the faeces via biliary elimination. Less than 1% of the drug is excreted in its unchanged form. After an oral dose of trazodone, it was found to be excreted 20% in the urine as TPA and conjugates, 9% as the dihydrodiol metabolite, and less than 1% as unconjugated mCPP. mCPP is glucuronidated and sulfated similarly to other trazodone metabolites. == Chemistry == Trazodone is a triazolopyridine derivative and a phenylpiperazine that is structurally related to nefazodone and etoperidone, each of which is a derivative of it. == History == Trazodone was developed in Italy, in the 1960s, by Angelini Research Laboratories as a second-generation antidepressant. It was developed according to the mental pain hypothesis, which was postulated from studying patients and which proposes that major depression is associated with a decreased pain threshold. In sharp contrast to most other antidepressants available at the time of its development, trazodone showed minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Trazodone was patented and marketed in many countries all over the world. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981 and was the first non-tricyclic or MAOI antidepressant approved in the US. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Trazodone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while trazodone hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Trazodone has been marketed under a large number of brand names throughout the world. Major brand names include Desyrel (worldwide), Donaren (Brazil), Molipaxin (Ireland, United Kingdom), Oleptro (United States), Trazorel (Canada), and Trittico (worldwide). == Research == Trazodone may be effective in the treatment of sexual dysfunction, for instance female sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction. A 2003 systematic review and meta-analysis found some indication that trazodone may be useful in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Besides trazodone alone, a combination of trazodone and bupropion (developmental code names and tentative brand names S1P-104, S1P-205, Lorexys, and Orexa) is under development for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction. As of September 2021, it is in phase 2 clinical trials for these indications. It has been in this stage of clinical development since at least February 2015. Trazodone may be useful in the treatment of certain symptoms like sleep disturbances in alcohol withdrawal and recovery. However, reviews have recommended against use of trazodone for alcohol withdrawal due to inadequate evidence. Very limited evidence suggests that trazodone might be useful in the treatment of certain symptoms in cocaine use disorder. Trazodone has been reported to be effective in the treatment of sleep apnea. Cochrane reviews found that trazodone was not effective in the treatment of agitation in dementia. Another Cochrane review found that trazodone might be useful in the treatment of sleep disturbances in dementia. Further systematic reviews have found that trazodone may be effective for behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementias such as frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Trazodone has been studied as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia. It has been reported to decrease negative symptoms without worsening positive symptoms although improvement in negative symptoms was modest. Trazodone has also been reported to be effective in treating antipsychotic-related extrapyramidal symptoms such as akathisia. Trazodone has been studied and reported to be effective in the treatment of bulimia, but there is limited evidence to support this use. It might be useful in the treatment of night eating disorder as well. Trazodone might be effective in the treatment of adjustment disorder. It may also be effective in the treatment of bruxism in children and adolescents. Trazodone may be useful in the treatment of certain chronic pain disorders. There is limited but conflicting evidence to support the use of trazodone in the treatment of headaches and migraines in children. Trazodone may be useful in the treatment of fibromyalgia as well as diabetic neuropathy. It may also be useful in the treatment of burning mouth syndrome. A 2004 narrative review claimed that trazodone could be used in the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome. Trazodone may also be effective in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. It may be effective in the treatment of non-cardiac chest pain as well. Trazodone may be useful in promoting motor recovery after stroke. Trazodone is sometimes prescribed to treat premature ejaculation but clomipramine and paroxetine may be more effective. == Veterinary use == Trazodone has been used to reduce anxiety and stress, to improve sleep, and to produce sedation in dogs and cats in veterinary medicine. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
471	Cilostazol	WIKIPEDIA	"Cilostazol, sold under the brand name Pletal among others, is a medication used to help the symptoms of intermittent claudication in peripheral vascular disease. If no improvement is seen after 3 months, stopping the medication is reasonable. It may also be used to prevent stroke. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, dizziness, and cough. Serious side effects may include decreased survival in those with heart failure, low platelets, and low white blood cells. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor which works by inhibiting platelet aggregation and dilating arteries. Cilostazol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2019, it was the 347th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800 thousand prescriptions. == Medical uses == Cilostazol is approved for the treatment of intermittent claudication in the United States and United Kingdom. Cilostazol is also used for secondary stroke prevention, though to date no regulatory body has approved it specifically for that indication. === Heart failure === Cilostazol is dangerous for people with severe heart failure. Cilostazol has been studied in people without heart failure, without evidence of harm, but much more data would be needed to determine no risk exists. Although cilostazol would not be approvable for a trivial condition the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee and FDA concluded that fully informed patients and physicians should be able to choose to use it to treat intermittent claudication. Patient and physician labeling will describe the basis for concern and the incomplete information available. == Adverse effects == Possible side effects of cilostazol use include headache (the most common), diarrhea, severe heat intolerance, abnormal stools, increased heart rate, and palpitations. == Interactions == Cilostazol is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, two isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as itraconazole, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and diltiazem, are known to interact with cilostazol. The proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, increases exposure to the active metabolite of cilostazol. A single report has been made of grapefruit juice possibly increasing the effects of cilostazol; some drug information sources list this as a possible interaction. The FDA-approved labeling of cilostazol notes that grapefruit juice (which is a CYP3A4 inhibitor) increases the drug's maximum concentration by around 50%. == Mechanism == Cilostazol is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3) with therapeutic focus on increasing cAMP. An increase in cAMP results in an increase in the active form of protein kinase A (PKA), which is directly related with an inhibition in platelet aggregation. PKA also prevents the activation of an enzyme (myosin light-chain kinase) that is important in the contraction of smooth muscle cells, thereby exerting its vasodilatory effect. == References == == External links == ""Cilostazol"".

472	Ritalinic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Ritalinic acid is a substituted phenethylamine and an inactive major metabolite of the psychostimulant drugs methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate and ethylphenidate. When administered orally, methylphenidate is extensively metabolized in the liver by hydrolysis of the ester group yielding ritalinic acid. The hydrolysis was found to be catalyzed by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). Etymologically, ritalinic acid shares its roots with Ritalin, a common brand name for methylphenidate. == Uses == Ritalinic acid is used as an intermediate in the synthesis of methylphenidate and its analogues, such as ethylphenidate and isopropylphenidate. == References == == External links == Ritalinic acid on PubChem	MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.6939639, 'ICAL': 0.0}
473	Gabapentin	WIKIPEDIA	"Gabapentin, sold under the brand name Neurontin among others, is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used to treat neuropathic pain and also for partial seizures of epilepsy. It is a commonly used medication for the treatment of neuropathic pain caused by diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and central pain. It is moderately effective: about 30–40% of those given gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia have a meaningful benefit. Gabapentin acts by decreasing activity of the α2δ-1 protein, coded by the CACNA2D1 gene, first known as an auxiliary subunit of voltage gated calcium channels. However, see Pharmacodynamics, below. By binding to α2δ-1, gabapentin reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters (primarily glutamate) and as a result, reduces excess excitation of neuronal networks in the spinal cord and brain. Sleepiness and dizziness are the most common side effects. Serious side effects include respiratory depression, and allergic reactions. As with all other antiepileptic drugs approved by the FDA, gabapentin is labeled for an increased risk of suicide. Lower doses are recommended in those with kidney disease. Gabapentin was first approved for use in the United Kingdom in 1993. It has been available as a generic medication in the United States since 2004. It is the first of several other drugs that are similar in structure and mechanism, called gabapentinoids. In 2022, it was the tenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 40 million prescriptions. During the 1990s, Parke-Davis, a subsidiary of Pfizer, used a number of illegal techniques to encourage physicians in the United States to prescribe gabapentin for unapproved uses. They have paid out millions of dollars to settle lawsuits regarding these activities. == Medical uses == Gabapentin is recommended for use in focal seizures and neuropathic pain. Gabapentin is prescribed off-label in the US and the UK, for example, for the treatment of non-neuropathic pain, anxiety disorders, sleep problems and bipolar disorder. In recent years, gabapentin has seen increased use, particularly in the elderly. There is concern regarding gabapentin's off-label use due to the lack of strong scientific evidence for its efficacy in multiple conditions, its proven side effects and its potential for misuse and physical/psychological dependency. === Seizures === Gabapentin is approved for the treatment of focal seizures; however, it is not effective for generalized epilepsy. === Neuropathic pain === Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line treatment for chronic neuropathic pain by various medical authorities. This is a general recommendation applicable to all neuropathic pain syndromes except for trigeminal neuralgia, where it may be used as a second- or third-line agent. Regarding the specific diagnoses, a systematic review has found evidence for gabapentin to provide pain relief for some people with postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. Gabapentin is approved for the former indication in the US. In addition to these two neuropathies, European Federation of Neurological Societies guideline notes gabapentin effectiveness for central pain. A combination of gabapentin with an opioid or nortriptyline may work better than either drug alone. Gabapentin shows substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or a patient global impression of change (PGIC) ""very much improved"") for neuropathic pain (postherpetic neuralgia or peripheral diabetic neuropathy) in 30–40% of subjects treated as compared to those treated with placebo. Evidence finds little or no benefit and significant risk in those with chronic low back pain or sciatica. Gabapentin is not effective in HIV-associated sensory neuropathy and neuropathic pain due to cancer. === Anxiety === There is a small amount of research on the use of gabapentin for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Gabapentin is effective for the long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder and in reducing preoperative anxiety. In a controlled trial of breast cancer survivors with anxiety, and a trial for social phobia, gabapentin significantly reduced anxiety levels. For panic disorder, gabapentin has produced mixed results. === Sleep === Gabapentin is effective in treating sleep disorders such as insomnia and restless legs syndrome that are the result of an underlying illness, but comes with some risk of discontinuation and withdrawal symptoms after prolonged use at higher doses. Gabapentin enhances slow-wave sleep in people with primary insomnia. It also improves sleep quality by elevating sleep efficiency and decreasing spontaneous arousal. === Drug dependence === Gabapentin is moderately effective in reducing the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and associated craving. The evidence in favor of gabapentin is weak in the treatment of alcoholism: it does not contribute to the achievement of abstinence, and the data on the relapse of heavy drinking and percent of days abstinent do not robustly favor gabapentin; it only decreases the percent days of heavy drinking. Gabapentin is ineffective in cocaine dependence and methamphetamine use, and it does not increase the rate of smoking cessation. While some studies indicate that gabapentin does not significantly reduce the symptoms of opiate withdrawal, there is increasing evidence that gabapentinoids are effective in controlling some of the symptoms during opiate detoxification. A clinical study in Iran, where heroin dependence is a significant social and public health problem, showed gabapentin produced positive results during an inpatient therapy program, particularly by reducing opioid-induced hyperalgesia and drug craving. There is insufficient evidence for its use in cannabis dependence. === Other === Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line treatment of the acquired pendular nystagmus, torsional nystagmus, and infantile nystagmus; however, it does not work in periodic alternating nystagmus. Gabapentin decreases the frequency of hot flashes in both menopausal women and people with breast cancer. However, antidepressants have similar efficacy, and treatment with estrogen more effectively prevents hot flashes. Gabapentin reduces spasticity in multiple sclerosis and is prescribed as one of the first-line options. It is an established treatment of restless legs syndrome. Gabapentin alleviates itching in kidney failure (uremic pruritus) and itching of other causes. It may be an option in essential or orthostatic tremor. Gabapentin does not appear to provide benefit for bipolar disorder, complex regional pain syndrome, post-surgical pain, or tinnitus, or prevent episodic migraine in adults. == Contraindications == Gabapentin should be used carefully and at lower doses in people with kidney problems due to possible accumulation and toxicity. It is unclear if it is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding. == Side effects == Dizziness and somnolence are the most frequent side effects. Fatigue, ataxia, peripheral edema (swelling of extremities), and nystagmus are also common. A 2017 meta-analysis found that gabapentin also increased the risk of difficulties in mentation and visual disturbances as compared to a placebo. Gabapentin is associated with a weight gain of 2.2 kg (4.9 lb) after 1.5 months of use. Case studies indicate that it may cause anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction, as well as myoclonus that disappear after discontinuing gabapentin or replacing it with other medication. Fever, swollen glands that do not go away, eyes or skin turning yellow, unusual bruises or bleeding, unexpected muscle pain or weakness, rash, long-lasting stomach pain which may indicate an inflamed pancreas, hallucinations, anaphylaxis, respiratory depression, and increased suicidal ideation are rare but serious side effects. === Suicide === As with all antiepileptic drugs approved in the US, gabapentin label contains a warning of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This warning is based on a meta-analysis of all approved antiepileptic drugs in 2008, and not with gabapentin alone. According to an experimental meta-analysis of insurance claims database, gabapentin use is associated with about 40% increased risk of suicide, suicide attempt and violent death as compared with a reference anticonvulsant drug topiramate. The risk is increased for people with bipolar disorder or epilepsy. Another study has shown an approximately doubled rate of suicide attempts and self-harm in people with bipolar disorder who are taking gabapentin versus those taking lithium. A large Swedish study suggests that gabapentinoids are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, head/body injuries, and road traffic incidents and offences. On the other hand, a study published by the Harvard Data Science Review found that gabapentin was associated with a significantly reduced rate of suicide. === Respiratory depression === Serious breathing suppression, potentially fatal, may occur when gabapentin is taken together with opioids, benzodiazepines, or other depressants, or by people with underlying lung problems such as COPD. Gabapentin and opioids are commonly prescribed or abused together, and research indicates that the breathing suppression they cause is additive. For example, gabapentin use before joint replacement or laparoscopic surgery increased the risk of respiratory depression by 30–60%. A Canadian study showed that use of gabapentin and other gabapentinoids, whether for epilepsy, neuropathic pain or other chronic pain was associated with a 35–58% increased risk for severe exacerbation of pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. === Withdrawal and dependence === Withdrawal symptoms typically occur 1–2 days after abruptly stopping gabapentin (almost unambiguously due to extended use and during a very short-term rebound phenomenon) — similar to, albeit less intense than most benzodiazepines. Agitation, confusion and disorientation are the most frequently reported, followed by gastrointestinal complaints and sweating, and more rare tremor, tachycardia, hypertension and insomnia. In some cases, users experience withdrawal seizures after chronic or semi-chronic use in the absence of periodic cycles or breaks during repeating and consecutive use. All these symptoms subside when gabapentin is re-instated or tapered off gradually at an appropriate rate. On its own, gabapentin appears to not have a substantial addictive power. In human and animal experiments, it shows limited to no rewarding effects. The vast majority of people abusing gabapentin are current or former abusers of opioids or sedatives. In these persons, gabapentin can boost the opioid ""high"" as well as decrease commonly experienced opioid-withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety. == Overdose == Through excessive ingestion, accidental or otherwise, persons may experience overdose symptoms including drowsiness, sedation, blurred vision, slurred speech, somnolence, uncontrollable jerking motions, and anxiety. A very high amount taken is associated with breathing suppression, coma, and possibly death, particularly if combined with alcohol or opioids. == Pharmacology == === Animal Models === Gabapentin, prevents seizures in a dose-related manner in several laboratory animal models. These models include spinal extensor seizures from low-intensity electroshock to the forebrain in mice, maximal electroshock in rats, spinal extensor seizures in DBA/2 mice with a genetic sensitivity to seizures induced by loud noise, and in rats ""kindled"" to produce focal seizures by repeated prior electrical stimulation of the hippocampus. Gabapentin slightly increased spontaneous absence-like seizures in a genetically susceptible strain recorded with electroencephalography. All of these effects of gabapentin were seen at dosages at or below the threshold for producing ataxia. Gabapentin also has been tested in a wide variety of animal models that are relevant for analgesic actions. Generally, gabapentin is not active to prevent pain-related behaviors in models of acute nociceptive pain, but it prevents pain-related behaviors when animals are made sensitive by prior peripheral inflammation or peripheral nerve damage (inflammatory or neuropathic conditions). === Pharmacodynamics === Gabapentin is a ligand of the α2δ calcium channel subunit. α2δ was first described as an auxiliary protein connected to the main α1 subunit (the channel-forming protein) of high voltage activated voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-type, N-type, P/Q type, and R-type). The same α2δ protein has more recently been shown to interact directly with some NMDA-type and AMPA-type glutamate receptors at presynaptic sites and also with thrombospondin (an extracellular matrix protein secreted by astroglial cells). Gabapentin is not a direct calcium channel blocker: it exerts its actions by disrupting the regulatory function of α2δ and its interactions with other proteins. Gabapentin reduces delivery of intracellular calcium channels to the cell membrane, reduces the activation of the channels by the α2δ subunit, decreases signaling leading to neurotransmitters release, and disrupts interactions of α2δ with NMDA receptors, neurexins, and thrombospondins. Out of the four known isoforms of α2δ protein, gabapentin binds with similar high affinity to two: α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. All of the pharmacological properties of gabapentin tested to date are explained by its binding to just one isoform – α2δ-1. The endogenous α-amino acids L-leucine and L-isoleucine, which resemble gabapentin in chemical structure, bind α2δ with similar affinity to gabapentin and are present in human cerebrospinal fluid at micromolar concentrations. They may be the endogenous ligands of the α2δ subunit, and they competitively antagonize the effects of gabapentin. Accordingly, while gabapentin has nanomolar affinity for the α2δ subunit, its potency in vivo is in the low micromolar range, and competition for binding by endogenous L-amino acids is likely to be responsible for this discrepancy. Gabapentin is a potent activator of voltage-gated potassium channels KCNQ3 and KCNQ5, even at low nanomolar concentrations. However, this activation is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism of gabapentin's therapeutic effects. Gabapentin is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter glutamate and competitively inhibits branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT), slowing down the synthesis of glutamate. In particular, it inhibits BCAT-1 at high concentrations (Ki = 1 mM), but not BCAT-2. At very high concentrations gabapentin can suppress the growth of cancer cells, presumably by affecting mitochondrial catabolism, however, the precise mechanism remains elusive. Even though gabapentin is a structural GABA analogue, and despite its name, it does not bind to the GABA receptors, does not convert into GABATooltip γ-aminobutyric acid or another GABA receptor agonist in vivo, and does not modulate GABA transport or metabolism within the range of clinical dosing. In vitro gabapentin has been found to very weakly inhibit the GABA aminotransferase enzyme (Ki = 17–20 mM), however, this effect is so weak it is not clinically relevant at prescribed doses. === Pharmacokinetics === Gabapentin is absorbed from the intestines by an active transport process mediated via an amino acid transporter, presumably, LAT2. As a result, the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin is dose-dependent, with diminished bioavailability and delayed peak levels at higher doses. The oral bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 80% at 100 mg administered three times daily once every 8 hours, but decreases to 60% at 300 mg, 47% at 400 mg, 34% at 800 mg, 33% at 1,200 mg, and 27% at 1,600 mg, all with the same dosing schedule. Drugs that increase the transit time of gabapentin in the small intestine can increase its oral bioavailability; when gabapentin was co-administered with oral morphine, the oral bioavailability of a 600 mg dose of gabapentin increased by 50%. Gabapentin at a low dose of 100 mg has a Tmax (time to peak levels) of approximately 1.7 hours, while the Tmax increases to 3 to 4 hours at higher doses. Food does not significantly affect the Tmax of gabapentin and increases the Cmax and area-under-curve levels of gabapentin by approximately 10%. Gabapentin can cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. Gabapentin concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is approximately 9–14% of its blood plasma concentration. Due to its low lipophilicity, gabapentin requires active transport across the blood–brain barrier. The LAT1 is highly expressed at the blood–brain barrier and transports gabapentin across into the brain. As with intestinal absorption mediated by an amino acid transporter, the transport of gabapentin across the blood–brain barrier by LAT1 is saturable. Gabapentin does not bind to other drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) or OCTN2 (SLC22A5). It is not significantly bound to plasma proteins (<1%). Gabapentin undergoes little or no metabolism. Gabapentin is generally safe in people with liver cirrhosis. Gabapentin is eliminated renally in the urine. It has a relatively short elimination half-life, with the reported average value of 5 to 7 hours. Because of its short elimination half-life, gabapentin must be administered 3 to 4 times per day to maintain therapeutic levels. Gabapentin XR (brand name Gralise) is taken once a day. == Chemistry == Gabapentin is a 3,3-disubstituted derivative of GABA. Therefore, it is a GABA analogue, as well as a γ-amino acid. It is similar to several other compounds that collectively are called gabapentinoids. Specifically, it is a derivative of GABA with a pentyl disubstitution at 3 position, hence, the name - gabapentin, in such a way as to form a six-membered ring. After the formation of the ring, the amine and carboxylic groups are not in the same relative positions as they are in the GABA; they are more conformationally constrained. Although it has been known for some time that gabapentin must bind to the α2δ-1 protein in order to act pharmacologically (see Pharmacodynamics), the three-dimensional structure of the α2δ-1 protein with gabapentin bound (or alternatively, the native amino acid, L-Isoleucine bound) has only recently been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy. This study confirms other findings to show that both compounds alternatively can bind at a single extracellular site (somewhat distant from the calcium conducting pore of the voltage gated calcium channel α1 subunit) on the calcium channel and chemotaxis (Cache1) domain of α2δ-1. === Synthesis === A process for chemical synthesis and isolation of gabapentin with high yield and purity starts with conversion of 1,1-cyclohexanediacetic anhydride to 1,1-cyclohexanediacetic acid monoamide and is followed by a 'Hofmann' rearrangement in an aqueous solution of sodium hypobromite prepared in situ. == History == GABA is the principle inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. By the early 1970s, it was appreciated that there are two main classes of GABA receptors, GABAA and GABAB and also that baclofen was an agonist of GABAB receptors. Gabapentin was designed, synthesized and tested in mice by researchers at the pharmaceutical company Goedecke AG in Freiburg, Germany (a subsidiary of Parke-Davis). It was meant to be an analogue of the neurotransmitter GABA that could more easily cross the blood–brain barrier. It was first synthesized in 1974/75 and described in 1975 by Satzinger and Hartenstein. The first pharmacology findings published were sedating properties and prevention of seizures in mice evoked by the GABA antagonist, thiosemicarbazide. Shortly after, gabapentin was shown in vitro to reduce the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine from slices of rat caudate nucleus (striatum). This study provided evidence that the action of gabapentin, unlike baclofen, did not arise from the GABAB receptor. Subsesquently, more than 2,000 scientific papers have been published that contain the words ""gabapentin pharmacology"" or ""pharmacology of gabapentin"" (Google Scholar citation search). Initial clinical trials utilizing small numbers of subjects were for treatment of spasticity and migraine but neither study had statistical power to allow conclusions. In 1987, the first positive results with gabapentin were obtained in a clinical trial using three dose groups versus pre-treatment seizure frequency for 75 days, as add-on treatment in patients who still had seizures despite taking other medications. This study did not show statistically significant results, but it did show a strong dose-related trend to decreased frequency of seizures. Under the brand name Neurontin, it was first approved in the United Kingdom in May 1993, for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration followed in December 1993, also for use as an adjuvant (effective when added to other antiseizure drugs) medication to control partial seizures in adults; that indication was extended to children in 2000. Subsequently, gabapentin was approved in the United States for the treatment of pain from postherpetic neuralgia in 2002. A generic version of gabapentin first became available in the United States in 2004. An extended-release formulation of gabapentin for once-daily administration, under the brand name Gralise, was approved in the United States for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in January 2011. In recent years, gabapentin has been prescribed for an increasing range of disorders and is one of the more common medications used, particularly in elderly people. == Society and culture == === Legal status === ==== United Kingdom ==== Effective April 2019, the United Kingdom reclassified the drug as a class C controlled substance. ==== United States ==== Gabapentin is not a controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Effective 1 July 2017, Kentucky classified gabapentin as a schedule V controlled substance statewide. Gabapentin is scheduled V drug in other states such as West Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Utah, and Virginia. === Off-label promotion === Although some small, non-controlled studies in the 1990s—mostly sponsored by gabapentin's manufacturer—suggested that treatment for bipolar disorder with gabapentin may be promising, the preponderance of evidence suggests that it is not effective. ==== Franklin v. Parke-Davis case ==== After the corporate acquisition of the original patent holder, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer admitted that there had been violations of FDA guidelines regarding the promotion of unproven off-label uses for gabapentin in the Franklin v. Parke-Davis case. While off-label prescriptions are common for many drugs, marketing of off-label uses of a drug is not. In 2004, Warner-Lambert (which subsequently was acquired by Pfizer) agreed to plead guilty for activities of its Parke-Davis subsidiary, and to pay $430 million in fines to settle civil and criminal charges regarding the marketing of Neurontin for off-label purposes. The 2004 settlement was one of the largest in U.S. history up to that point, and the first off-label promotion case brought successfully under the False Claims Act. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan sued Pfizer Inc., alleging that the pharmaceutical company had misled Kaiser by recommending Neurontin as an off-label treatment for certain conditions (including bipolar disorder, migraines, and neuropathic pain). In 2010, a federal jury in Massachusetts ruled in Kaiser's favor, finding that Pfizer violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and was liable for US$47.36 million in damages, which was automatically trebled to just under $142.1 million. Aetna, Inc. and a group of employer health plans prevailed in their similar Neurontin-related claims against Pfizer. Pfizer appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the verdict, and in 2013, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case. ==== Gabasync ==== Gabasync, a treatment consisting of a combination of gabapentin and two other medications (flumazenil and hydroxyzine) as well as therapy, is an ineffective treatment promoted for methamphetamine addiction, though it had also been claimed to be effective for dependence on alcohol or cocaine. It was marketed as PROMETA. While the individual drugs had been approved by the FDA, their off-label use for addiction treatment has not. Gabasync was marketed by Hythiam, Inc. which is owned by Terren Peizer, a former junk bond salesman who has since been indicted for securities fraud relative to another company. Hythiam charges up to $15,000 per patient to license its use (of which half goes to the prescribing physician, and half to Hythiam). In November 2011, the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (financed by Hythiam and carried out at UCLA) were published in the peer-reviewed journal Addiction. It concluded that Gabasync is ineffective: ""The PROMETA protocol, consisting of flumazenil, gabapentin and hydroxyzine, appears to be no more effective than placebo in reducing methamphetamine use, retaining patients in treatment or reducing methamphetamine craving."" Barrons, in a November 2005 article entitled ""Curb Your Cravings For This Stock"", wrote ""If the venture works out for patients and the investing public, it'll be a rare success for Peizer, who's promoted a series of disappointing small-cap medical or technology stocks ... since his days at Drexel"". Journalist Scott Pelley said to Peizer in 2007: ""Depending and who you talk to, you're either a revolutionary or a snake oil salesman."" 60 Minutes, NBC News, and The Dallas Morning News criticized Peizer after the company bypassed clinical studies and government approval when bringing to market Prometa; the addiction drug proved to be completely ineffective. Journalist Adam Feuerstein opined: ""most of what Peizer says is dubious-sounding hype"". ==== Usage trends ==== The period from 2008 to 2018 saw a significant increase in the consumption of gabapentinoids. A study published in Nature Communications in 2023 highlights this trend, demonstrating a notable escalation in sales of gabapentinoids. The study, which analyzed healthcare data across 65 countries/ regions, found that the consumption rate of gabapentinoids had doubled over the decade, driven by their use in a wide range of indications. === Brand names === Gabapentin was originally marketed under the brand name Neurontin. Since it became generic, it has been marketed worldwide using over 300 different brand names. An extended-release formulation of gabapentin for once-daily administration was introduced in 2011, for postherpetic neuralgia under the brand name Gralise. In the US, Neurontin is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. === Related drugs === Parke-Davis developed a drug called pregabalin, which is related in structure to gabapentin, as a successor to gabapentin. Another similar drug atagabalin has been unsuccessfully tried by Pfizer as a treatment for insomnia. A prodrug form (gabapentin enacarbil) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). === Recreational use === When taken in excess, gabapentin can induce euphoria, a sense of calm, a cannabis-like high, improved sociability, and reduced alcohol or cocaine cravings. Also known on the streets as ""Gabbies"", gabapentin was reported in 2017 to be increasingly abused and misused for these euphoric effects. About 1 percent of the responders to an Internet poll and 22 percent of those attending addiction facilities had a history of abuse of gabapentin. Gabapentin misuse, toxicity, and use in suicide attempts among adults in the US increased from 2013 to 2017. After Kentucky implemented stricter legislation regarding opioid prescriptions in 2012, there was an increase in gabapentin-only and multi-drug use from 2012 to 2015. The majority of these cases were from overdose in suspected suicide attempts. These rates were also accompanied by increases in abuse and recreational use. Withdrawal symptoms, often resembling those of benzodiazepine withdrawal, play a role in the physical dependence some users experience. Its misuse predominantly coincides with the usage of other CNS depressant drugs, namely opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. == Veterinary use == In cats, gabapentin can be used as an analgesic in multi-modal pain management, anxiety medication to reduce stress during travel or vet visits, and anticonvulsant. Veterinarians may prescribe gabapentin as an anticonvulsant and pain reliever in dogs. It has beneficial effects for treating epilepsy, different kinds of pain (chronic, neuropathic, and post-operative pain), and anxiety, lip-licking behaviour, storm phobia, fear-based aggression. It is also used to treat chronic pain-associated nerve inflammation in horses and dogs. Side effects include tiredness and loss of coordination, but these effects generally go away within 24 hours of starting the medication. == References == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
476	Trosec	WIKIPEDIA	Trospium chloride is a muscarinic antagonist used to treat overactive bladder. It has side effects typical of this class of drugs, namely dry mouth, stomach upset, and constipation; these side effects cause problems with people taking their medicine as directed. However it doesn't cause central nervous system side effects like some other muscarinic antagonists. Chemically it is a quaternary ammonium cation which causes it to stay in periphery rather than crossing the blood–brain barrier. It works by causing the smooth muscle in the bladder to relax. It was patented in 1966 and approved for medical use in 1974. It was first approved in the US in 2004, and an extended release version was brought to market in 2007. It became generic in the EU in 2009, and the first extended-release generic was approved in the US in 2012. == Medical uses == Trospium chloride is used for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge incontinence and frequent urination. It should not be used with people who retain urine, who have severe digestive conditions, myasthenia gravis, narrow-angle glaucoma, or tachyarrhythmia. It should be used with caution in people who have problems with their autonomous nervous system (dysautonomia) or who have gastroesophageal reflux disease, or in whom fast heart rates are undesirable, such as people with hyperthyroidism, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of trospium chloride in pregnant women and there are signs of harm to the fetus in animal studies. The drug was excreted somewhat in the milk of nursing mothers. The drug was studied in children. == Side effects == Side effects are typical of gastrointestinal effects of anticholinergic drugs, and include dry mouth, indigestion, and constipation. These side effects lead to problems with adherence, especially for older people. The only CNS side effect is headache, which was very rare. Tachycardia is a rare side effect. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Trospium chloride is a muscarinic antagonist. Trospium chloride blocks the effect of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors organs that are responsive to the compounds, including the bladder. Its parasympatholytic action relaxes the smooth muscle in the bladder. Receptor assays showed that trospium chloride has negligible affinity for nicotinic receptors as compared to muscarinic receptors at concentrations obtained from therapeutic doses. The drug has high and similar affinity for all five of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes, including the M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral administration, less than 10% of the dose is absorbed. Mean absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose is 9.6% (range: 4.0 to 16.1%). Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) occur between 5 and 6 hours post-dose. Mean Cmax increases greater than dose-proportionally; a 3-fold and 4-fold increase in Cmax was observed for dose increases from 20 mg to 40 mg and from 20 mg to 60 mg, respectively. AUC exhibits dose linearity for single doses up to 60 mg. Trospium chloride exhibits diurnal variability in exposure with a decrease in Cmax and AUC of up to 59% and 33%, respectively, for evening relative to morning doses. Administration with a high fat meal resulted in reduced absorption, with AUC and Cmax values 70 to 80% lower than those obtained when trospium chloride was administered while fasting. Therefore, it is recommended that trospium chloride should be taken at least one hour prior to meals or on an empty stomach. Protein binding ranged from 50 to 85% when concentration levels of trospium chloride (0.5 to 50 ng/mL) were incubated with human serum in vitro. The 3H-trospium chloride ratio of plasma to whole blood was 1.6:1. This ratio indicates that the majority of 3H-trospium chloride is distributed in plasma. The apparent volume of distribution for a 20 mg oral dose is 395 (± 140) liters. The metabolic pathway of trospium in humans has not been fully defined. Of the 10% of the dose absorbed, metabolites account for approximately 40% of the excreted dose following oral administration. The major metabolic pathway is hypothesized as ester hydrolysis with subsequent conjugation of benzylic acid to form azoniaspironortropanol with glucuronic acid. Cytochrome P450 is not expected to contribute significantly to the elimination of trospium. Data taken from in vitro human liver microsomes investigating the inhibitory effect of trospium on seven cytochrome P450 isoenzyme substrates (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) suggest a lack of inhibition at clinically relevant concentrations. The plasma half-life for trospium chloride following oral administration is approximately 20 hours. After oral administration of an immediate-release formulation of 14C-trospium chloride, the majority of the dose (85.2%) was recovered in feces and a smaller amount (5.8% of the dose) was recovered in urine; 60% of the radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged trospium. The mean renal clearance for trospium (29 L/hour) is 4-fold higher than average glomerular filtration rate, indicating that active tubular secretion is a major route of elimination for trospium. There may be competition for elimination with other compounds that are also renally eliminated. == Chemistry == Anticholinergic drugs used to treat overactive bladder were all amines as of 2003. Quaternary ammonium cations in general are more hydrophilic than other amines and don't cross membranes well, so they tend to be poorly absorbed from the digestive system, and to not cross the blood–brain barrier. Oxybutynin, tolterodine, darifenacin, and solifenacin are tertiary amines while trospium chloride and propantheline are quaternary amines. == History == The synthesis of trospium was described by scientists from Dr. Robert Pfleger Chemische Fabrik GmbH, Heinz Bertholdt, Robert Pfleger, and Wolfram Schulz, in US. Pat. No. 3,480,626 (the US equivalent to DE119442), and its activity was first published in the literature in 1967. The first regulatory approval was granted in Germany in August 1999 to Madaus AG for Regurin 20 mg Tablets.: 13 Madaus is considered the originator for regulatory filings worldwide. The German filing was recognized throughout Europe under the Mutual Recognition Procedure.: 13 Madaus licensed the US rights to trospium chloride to Interneuron in 1999 and Interneuron ran clinical trials in the US to win FDA approval. Interneuron changed its name to Indevus in 2002 Indevus entered into a partnership with Odyssey Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Pliva, to market the drug in April 2004, and won FDA approval for the drug, which it branded as Sanctura, in May 2004. The approval earned Indevus a milestone payment of $120M from Pliva, which had already paid Indevus $30 million at signing; the market for overactive bladder therapies was estimated to be worth $1.1 billion in 2004. In 2005 Pliva exited the relationship, selling its rights to Esprit Pharma, and in September 2007 Allergan acquired Esprit, and negotiated a new agreement with Indevus under which Allergan would completely take over the US manufacturing, regulatory approvals, and marketing. A month before, Indevus had received FDA approval for an extended release formulation that allowed once a day dosing, Sanctura XR. Indevus had developed intellectual property around the extended release formulation which it licensed to Madaus for most of the world. In 2012 the FDA approved the first generic version of the extended release formulation, granting approval to the ANDA that Watson Pharmaceuticals had filed in 2009. Annual sales in the US at that time were $67M. European patents had expired in 2009. As of 2016, the drug is available worldwide under many brand names and formulations, including oral, extended release, suppositories, and injections. == Society and culture == Marketing rights to the drug became subject to parallel import litigation in Europe in the case of Speciality European Pharma Ltd v Doncaster Pharmaceuticals Group Ltd / Madaus GmbH (Case No. A3/2014/0205) which was resolved in March 2015. Madaus had exclusively licensed the right to use the Regurin trademark to Speciality European Pharma Ltd. In 2009, when European patents expired on the drug, Doncaster Pharmaceuticals Group, a well known parallel importer, which had been selling the drug in the UK under another label, Ceris, which was used in France, began to put stickers on their packaging with the Regurin name. Speciality and Madaus sued and initially won based on the argument that 90% of prescriptions were already generic, but Doncaster appealed and won the appeal based on the argument that it could not charge a premium with a generic label. The case has broad implications for trade in the EU. == Research == In 2007 Indevus partnered with Alkermes to develop and test an inhaled form of trospium chloride as a treatment for COPD; it was in Phase II trials at that time. == References == == External links == Trospium chloride at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
479	Daidzein	WIKIPEDIA	Daidzein (7-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-chromen-4-one) is a naturally occurring compound found exclusively in soybeans and other legumes and structurally belongs to a class of compounds known as isoflavones. Daidzein and other isoflavones are produced in plants through the phenylpropanoid pathway of secondary metabolism and are used as signal carriers, and defense responses to pathogenic attacks. In humans, recent research has shown the viability of using daidzein in medicine for menopausal relief, osteoporosis, blood cholesterol, and lowering the risk of some hormone-related cancers, and heart disease. Despite the known health benefits, the use of both puerarin and daidzein is limited by their poor bioavailability and low water solubility. == Natural occurrence == Daidzein and other isoflavone compounds, such as genistein, are present in a number of plants and herbs like kwao krua (Pueraria mirifica) and kudzu. It can also be found in Maackia amurensis cell cultures. Daidzein can be found in food such as soybeans and soy products like tofu and textured vegetable protein. Soy isoflavones are a group of compounds found in and isolated from the soybean. Of note, total isoflavones in soybeans are—in general—37 percent daidzein, 57 percent genistein and 6 percent glycitein, according to USDA data. Soy germ contains 41.7 percent daidzein. == Biosynthesis == === History === The isoflavonoid pathway has long been studied because of its prevalence in a wide variety of plant species, including as pigmentation in many flowers, as well as serving as signals in plants and microbes. The isoflavone synthase (IFS) enzyme was suggested to be a P-450 oxygenase family, and this was confirmed by Shinichi Ayabe's laboratory in 1999. IFS exists in two isoforms that can use both liquiritigenin and naringenin to give daidzein and genistein respectively. === Pathway === Daidzein is an isoflavonoid derived from the shikimate pathway that forms an oxygen containing heterocycle through a cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme that is NADPH dependent. The biosynthesis of daidzein begins with L-phenylalanine and undergoes a general phenylpropanoid pathway where the shikimate derived aromatic ring is shifted to the adjacent carbon of the heterocycle. The process begins with phenylalanine ligase (PAL) cleaving the amino group from L-Phe forming the unsaturated carboxylic acid, cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is then hydroxylated by membrane protein cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) to form p-coumaric acid. P-coumaric acid then acts as the starter unit which gets loaded with coenzyme A by 4-coumaroyl:CoA-ligase (4CL). The starter unit (A) then undergoes three iterations of malonyl-CoA resulting in (B), which enzymes chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone reductase (CHR) modify to obtain trihydroxychalcone. CHR is NADPH dependent. Chalcone isomerase (CHI) then isomerizes trihydroxychalcone to liquiritigenin, the precursor to daidzein. A radical mechanism has been proposed in order to obtain daidzein from liquiritigenin, where an iron-containing enzyme, as well as NADPH and oxygen cofactors are used by a 2-hydroxyisoflavone synthase to oxidize liquiritigenin to a radical intermediate (C). A 1,2 aryl migration follows to form (D), which is subsequently oxidized to (E). Lastly, dehydration of the hydroxy group on C2 occurs through a 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (specifically GmHID1) to give daidzein. == Research == Daidzein has been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30). == Pathogen interactions == Because daidzein is a defensive factor, Pseudomonas syringae produces the HopZ1b effector which degrades a GmHID1 product. == Derivatives == Glyceollin, a type of phytoalexin === Glycosides === Daidzin is the 7-O-glucoside of daidzein. Puerarin is the 8-C-glucoside of daidzein. == Plants containing daidzein == Maackia amurensis Pueraria montana var. lobata Pueraria thomsonii == References ==	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD, MEDICAL	{'FO': -0.0036879594, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -0.006410651, ' MED': -0.040346317, 'ICAL': 0.0}
480	Haloperidol	WIKIPEDIA	"Haloperidol, sold under the brand name Haldol among others, is a typical antipsychotic medication. Haloperidol is used in the treatment of schizophrenia, tics in Tourette syndrome, mania in bipolar disorder, delirium, agitation, acute psychosis, and hallucinations from alcohol withdrawal. It may be used by mouth or injection into a muscle or a vein. Haloperidol typically works within 30 to 60 minutes. A long-acting formulation may be used as an injection every four weeks for people with schizophrenia or related illnesses, who either forget or refuse to take the medication by mouth. Haloperidol may result in a movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia, which may be permanent. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and QT interval prolongation may occur, the latter particularly with IV administration. In older people with psychosis due to dementia it results in an increased risk of death. When taken during pregnancy it may result in problems in the infant. It should not be used by people with Parkinson's disease. Haloperidol was discovered in 1958 by the team of Paul Janssen, prepared as part of a structure-activity relationship investigation into analogs of pethidine (meperidine). It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is the most commonly used typical antipsychotic. In 2020, it was the 303rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Haloperidol is used in the control of the symptoms of: Acute psychosis, such as drug-induced psychosis caused by ketamine, and phencyclidine, and psychosis associated with high fever or metabolic disease. Some evidence has found haloperidol to worsen psychosis due to psilocybin. Adjunctive treatment of alcohol and opioid withdrawal Agitation and confusion associated with cerebral sclerosis Alcohol-induced psychosis Hallucinations in alcohol withdrawal Hyperactive delirium (to control the agitation component of delirium) Hyperactivity, aggression Otherwise uncontrollable, severe behavioral disorders in children and adolescents Schizophrenia Therapeutic trial in personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder Treatment of intractable hiccups Treatment of neurological disorders, including tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome, and chorea Treatment of severe nausea and emesis in postoperative and palliative care, especially for palliating adverse effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in oncology. Also used as a first line antiemetic for acute cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. As chemical restraint in acute care psychiatry, mainly for violent and self-harming patients (controversial use but very commonly found in movies). Haloperidol was considered indispensable for treating psychiatric emergency situations. However, the newer atypical drugs have gained a greater role in a number of situations, as outlined in a series of consensus reviews published between 2001 and 2005. In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in schizophrenia, haloperidol demonstrated standard effectiveness. It was 13–16% more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine, approximately as effective as quetiapine and aripiprazole, and 10% less effective than paliperidone. A 2013 systematic review compared haloperidol to placebo in schizophrenia: In contrast to certain other antipsychotics like risperidone, haloperidol is ineffective as a hallucinogen antidote or ""trip killer"" in blocking the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). === Pregnancy and lactation === Data from animal experiments indicate haloperidol is not teratogenic, but is embryotoxic in high doses. In humans, no controlled studies exist. Reports in pregnant women revealed possible damage to the fetus, although most of the women were exposed to multiple drugs during pregnancy. In addition, reports indicate neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, such as agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder. Following accepted general principles, haloperidol should be given during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential fetal risk. Haloperidol is excreted in breast milk. A few studies have examined the impact of haloperidol exposure on breastfed infants and in most cases, there were no adverse effects on infant growth and development. === Other considerations === During long-term treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, the daily dose should be reduced to the lowest level needed for maintenance of remission. Sometimes, it may be indicated to terminate haloperidol treatment gradually. In addition, during long-term use, routine monitoring including measurement of BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and lipids, is recommended due to the risk of side effects. Other forms of therapy (psychotherapy, occupational therapy/ergotherapy, or social rehabilitation) should be instituted properly. PET imaging studies have suggested low doses are preferable. Clinical response was associated with at least 65% occupancy of D2 receptors, while greater than 72% was likely to cause hyperprolactinaemia and over 78% associated with extrapyramidal side effects. Doses of haloperidol greater than 5 mg increased the risk of side effects without improving efficacy. Patients responded with doses under even 2 mg in first-episode psychosis. For maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, an international consensus conference recommended a reduction dosage by about 20% every 6 months until a minimal maintenance dose is established. Depot forms are also available; these are injected deeply intramuscularly at regular intervals. The depot forms are not suitable for initial treatment, but are suitable for patients who have demonstrated inconsistency with oral dosages. The decanoate ester of haloperidol (haloperidol decanoate, trade names Haldol decanoate, Halomonth, Neoperidole) has a much longer duration of action, so is often used in people known to be noncompliant with oral medication. A dose is given by intramuscular injection once every two to four weeks. The IUPAC name of haloperidol decanoate is [4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl]piperidin-4-yl] decanoate. Topical formulations of haloperidol should not be used as treatment for nausea because research does not indicate this therapy is more effective than alternatives. == Adverse effects == Sources for the following lists of adverse effects: As haloperidol is a high-potency typical antipsychotic, it tends to produce significant extrapyramidal side effects. According to a 2013 meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs it was the most prone of the 15 for causing extrapyramidal side effects. With more than 6 months of use 14 percent of users gain weight. Haloperidol may be neurotoxic. Haloperidol, like all butyrophenone derivatives, destroy neurons (gray matter of the brain) - claims psychiatrist and addiction physician Alexander Danilin Prolonged use of the drug can lead to mental dependence. Common (>1% incidence) Extrapyramidal side effects including: Akathisia (motor restlessness) Dystonia (continuous spasms and muscle contractions) Muscle rigidity Parkinsonism (characteristic symptoms such as rigidity) Hypotension Anticholinergic side effects such as: (These adverse effects are less common than with lower-potency typical antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine.) Blurred vision Constipation Dry mouth Somnolence (which is not a particularly prominent side effect, as is supported by the results of the aforementioned meta-analysis.) Unknown frequency Anemia Headache Increased respiratory rate Orthostatic hypotension Prolonged QT interval Visual disturbances Rare (<1% incidence) === Contraindications === Pre-existing coma, acute stroke Severe intoxication with alcohol or other central depressant drugs Known allergy against haloperidol or other butyrophenones or other drug ingredients Known heart disease, when combined will tend towards cardiac arrest === Special cautions === A multiple-year study suggested this drug and other neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs commonly given to people with Alzheimer's with mild behavioral problems often make their condition worse and its withdrawal was even beneficial for some cognitive and functional measures. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis: analysis of 17 trials showed the risk of death in this group of patients was 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Most of the causes of death were either cardiovascular or infectious in nature. It is not clear to what extent this observation is attributed to antipsychotic drugs rather than the characteristics of the patients. The drug bears a boxed warning about this risk. Impaired liver function, as haloperidol is metabolized and eliminated mainly by the liver In patients with hyperthyroidism, the action of haloperidol is intensified and side effects are more likely. IV injections: risk of hypotension or orthostatic collapse Patients at special risk for the development of QT prolongation (hypokalemia, concomitant use of other drugs causing QT prolongation) Patients with a history of leukopenia: a complete blood count should be monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of the drug should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in white blood cells. Pre-existing Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies === Interactions === Amiodarone: Q-Tc interval prolongation (potentially dangerous change in heart rhythm). Amphetamine and methylphenidate: counteracts increased action of norepinephrine and dopamine in patients with narcolepsy or ADD/ADHD Epinephrine: action antagonized, paradoxical decrease in blood pressure may result Guanethidine: antihypertensive action antagonized Levodopa: decreased action of levodopa Lithium: rare cases of the following symptoms have been noted: encephalopathy, early and late extrapyramidal side effects, other neurologic symptoms, and coma. Methyldopa: increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects and other unwanted central effects Other central depressants (alcohol, tranquilizers, narcotics): actions and side effects of these drugs (sedation, respiratory depression) are increased. In particular, the doses of concomitantly used opioids for chronic pain can be reduced by 50%. Other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system: inducers such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and rifampicin decrease plasma levels and inhibitors such as quinidine, buspirone, and fluoxetine increase plasma levels Tricyclic antidepressants: metabolism and elimination of tricyclics significantly decreased, increased toxicity noted (anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects, lowering of seizure threshold) === Potential neurotoxicity === Several lines of evidence suggest that haloperidol exhibits neurotoxicity. Some studies report an association between antipsychotic medications, especially first-generation agents, and a decline in gray matter volume. Haloperidol irreversibly blocks the sigma σ1 receptor. It may exert deleterious effects on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) by attenuating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transcription and expression, associated with an increase in the long non-coding RNA BDNF-AS in the DLPFC. Besides the preceding mechanisms, haloperidol metabolizes into HPP+, a monoaminergic neurotoxin related to MPTP. This might be involved in the extrapyramidal symptoms that develop with long-term haloperidol therapy. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Overdose == === Symptoms === Symptoms are usually due to side effects. Most often encountered are: Anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation, paralytic ileus, difficulties in urinating, decreased perspiration) Coma in severe cases, accompanied by respiratory depression and massive hypotension, shock Hypotension or hypertension Rarely, serious ventricular arrhythmia (torsades de pointes), with or without prolonged QT-time Sedation Severe extrapyramidal side effects with muscle rigidity and tremors, akathisia, etc. === Treatment === Treatment is mostly symptomatic and involves intensive care with stabilization of vital functions. In early detected cases of oral overdose, induction of emesis, gastric lavage, and the use of activated charcoal can be tried. In the case of a severe overdose, antidotes such as bromocriptine or ropinirole may be used to treat the extrapyramidal effects caused by haloperidol, acting as dopamine receptor agonists. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for QT prolongation and severe arrhythmias should be treated with antiarrhythmic measures. === Prognosis === An overdose of haloperidol can be fatal, but in general the prognosis after overdose is good, provided the person has survived the initial phase. == Pharmacology == Haloperidol is a typical butyrophenone-type antipsychotic that exhibits high-affinity dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and slow receptor dissociation kinetics. It has effects similar to the phenothiazines. The drug binds preferentially to D2 and α1 receptors at low dose (ED50 = 0.13 and 0.42 mg/kg, respectively), and 5-HT2 receptors at a higher dose (ED50 = 2.6 mg/kg). Given that antagonism of D2 receptors is more beneficial on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors on the negative symptoms, this characteristic underlies haloperidol's greater effect on delusions, hallucinations and other manifestations of psychosis. Haloperidol's negligible affinity for histamine H1 receptors and muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors yields an antipsychotic with a lower incidence of sedation, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension though having higher rates of treatment emergent extrapyramidal symptoms. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== By mouth ==== The bioavailability of oral haloperidol ranges from 60 to 70%. However, there is a wide variance in reported mean Tmax and T1/2 in different studies, ranging from 1.7 to 6.1 hours and 14.5 to 36.7 hours respectively. ==== Intramuscular injections ==== The drug is well and rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability when injected intramuscularly. The Tmax is 20 minutes in healthy individuals and 33.8 minutes in patients with schizophrenia. The mean T1/2 is 20.7 hours. The decanoate injectable formulation is for intramuscular administration only and is not intended to be used intravenously. The plasma concentrations of haloperidol decanoate reach a peak at about six days after the injection, falling thereafter, with an approximate half-life of three weeks. ==== Intravenous injections ==== The bioavailability is 100% in intravenous (IV) injection, and the very rapid onset of action is seen within seconds. The T1/2 is 14.1 to 26.2 hours. The apparent volume of distribution is between 9.5 and 21.7 L/kg. The duration of action is four to six hours. ==== Therapeutic concentrations ==== Plasma levels of five to 15 micrograms per liter are typically seen for therapeutic response (Ulrich S, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998). The determination of plasma levels is rarely used to calculate dose adjustments but can be useful to check compliance. The concentration of haloperidol in brain tissue is about 20-fold higher compared to blood levels. It is slowly eliminated from brain tissue, which may explain the slow disappearance of side effects when the medication is stopped. ==== Distribution and metabolism ==== Haloperidol is heavily protein bound in human plasma, with a free fraction of only 7.5 to 11.6%. It is also extensively metabolized in the liver with only about 1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. The greatest proportion of the hepatic clearance is by glucuronidation, followed by reduction and CYP-mediated oxidation, primarily by CYP3A4. Haloperidol is metabolized into HPP+, a monoaminergic neurotoxin related to MPTP, by CYP3A enzymes. == Chemistry == Haloperidol is a crystalline material with a melting temperature of 150 °C. This drug has very low solubility in water (1.4 mg/100 mL), but it is soluble in chloroform, benzene, methanol, and acetone. It is also soluble in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (3 mg/mL) with heating. == History == Haloperidol was discovered by Paul Janssen. It was developed in 1958 at the Belgian company Janssen Pharmaceutica and submitted to the first of clinical trials in Belgium later that year. Haloperidol was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 12 April 1967; it was later marketed in the U.S. and other countries under the brand name Haldol by McNeil Laboratories. == Society and culture == === Cost === Haloperidol is relatively inexpensive, being up to 100 fold less expensive than newer antipsychotics. === Names === Haloperidol is the INN, BAN, USAN, AAN approved name. It is sold under the tradenames Aloperidin, Bioperidolo, Brotopon, Dozic, Duraperidol (Germany), Einalon S, Eukystol, Haldol (common tradename in the US and UK), Halol, Halosten, Keselan, Linton, Peluces, Serenace Norodol (Turkey) and Sigaperidol. == Research == Haloperidol was under investigation for the treatment of depression. It was employed as a short-term low-dose dopamine receptor antagonist to upregulate dopamine receptors and produce receptor supersensitivity followed by drug withdrawal as a means of treating depression. == Veterinary use == Haloperidol is also used on many different kinds of animals for nonselective tranquilization and diminishing behavioral arousal, in veterinary and other settings including captivity management. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
481	Pyroglu-tyr	PUBMED	 The tripeptide pyroGlu-Tyr-Pro amide was isolated from an aqueous extract prepared from dried alfalfa pellets. The tripeptide was quantitated using a competitive radioimmunoassay in which 125I-labeled thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), is displaced from antibody specific to TRH (pyroGlu-His-Pro amide). The pyroGlu-Tyr-Pro amide was purified by passing the filtered extract through QAE-Sephadex A25 at pH 5, followed by open bed chromatography on C18 silica using an H2O/methanol gradient, then preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on microbondapak C18 using a 10 mM HCl/methanol gradient, followed by G-10-Sephadex chromatography, SP-C25-Sephadex chromatography, QAE-Sephadex chromatography at pH 10.1, analytical HPLC on a microbondapak C18 column eluted with 10 mm HCl/acetonitrile, and analytical HPLC reverse phase chromatography on an APEX phenyl column eluted with H2O/acetonitrile. The tripeptide was essentially homogeneous after the final chromatography step, as judged by correspondence of immunoreactivity with A280. The sequence of the alfalfa tripeptide was determined to be Glu-Tyr-Pro by gas phase sequencing, after hydrolysis of pyroglutamic acid by mild acid hydrolysis. The mass of the alfalfa tripeptide was 389.1, as determined by fast ion bombardment mass spectroscopy, and was found to be identical to the mass of synthetic pyroGlu-Tyr-Pro amide. The sequence of the alfalfa tripeptide was also verified using B/E-linked scanning. I conclude that the tripeptide isolated from alfalfa differs from human thyrotropin-releasing hormone only by the substitution of tyrosine for histidine at position 2. The role of pyroGlu-Tyr-Pro amide in alfalfa is not known, but the existence of a family of thyrotropin-related peptides occurring in both the animal and the plant kingdoms indicates that the thyrotropin related peptides have a wide phylogenetic distribution.

483	Histidylproline	PUBMED	 Histidylproline a metabolite of Thyrotrophin Releasing Hormone specifically binds to both high and low affinity sites in fresh rat brain membranes. Characterisation of the high affinity site under optimal conditions demonstrated an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of approximately 9nM and maximum binding capacity of approximately 120 fmols/mg protein. Kinetic analysis of [3H]-His-Pro binding is limited by low binding density, instability of the high affinity site and rapid degradation of the radioligand. The thiol blocking reagent pHydroxymercuriphenylsulphonic acid (HMPS) inhibited [3H]-His-Pro degradation but also reduced binding of the peptide to membranes. The results are discussed with reference to the lack of specific binding sites in brain for the proposed neuropeptide and TRH metabolite cyclo(His-Pro). All four possible stereoisomers of cyclo(histidylproline) were individually synthesized, purified, and characterized. They were each tested for anorectic activity in rats with a free feeding paradigm over 24 h. Contrary to literature reports, none significantly reduced food intake at any time over the test period.

484	Phe-pro	PUBMED	 The fluorescently labeled prothrombin analog, Alexa Fluor 680-NH-CO-CH Cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the leading causes of death and disability In Russia: they rank second in the structure of mortality from diseases of the circulatory system and in the overall mortality of the population. Successful treatment of CVD involves an integrated approach to the problem, taking into account the compensation of cardiovascular disorders, the elimination of neurological and psychopathological syndromes, the improvement of cerebral circulation and the use of neuroprotective agents that increase the resistance of brain tissue to hypoxia and ischemia. Insufficient clinical efficacy of neuroprotectors is due to a number of objective reasons, of which only two are universal. The first of these reasons is the timing of the start of therapy in the clinic, as a rule, is outside the «therapeutic window»; the second reason is the fact that disturbance of the patency of the cerebral vessels in the affected area makes it difficult or impossible to deliver the drug to the penumbra area. The way out of this situation is the intranasal route of drug administration, which is characteristic for the analogs of regulatory peptides such as for H-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-OH (MGHPPGP). The review of clinical studies indicates that MGHPPGP is clinically effective in the treatment of ischemic stroke both in the acute period of stroke and in the recovery period. The clinical efficacy of MGHPPGP was shown both in atherothrombotic and cardioembolic subtypes of stroke, against the background of blood flow disturbances in both the carotid and vertebrobasilar systems. Цереброваскулярные заболевания (ЦВЗ) — одна из ведущих причин смертности и инвалидизации населения в России: они занимают второе место в структуре смертности от болезней системы кровообращения и в общей смертности населения. Успешное лечение ЦВЗ предполагает комплексный подход к проблеме, учитывающий компенсацию сердечно-сосудистых нарушений, устранение неврологических и психопатологических синдромов, улучшение церебральной циркуляции и применение нейропротективных средств, повышающих устойчивость мозговой ткани к гипоксии и ишемии. Недостаточная клиническая эффективность нейропротекторов обусловлена рядом объективных причин, из которых универсальными являются всего лишь две: первая — сроки начала терапии в клинике, как правило, находятся за пределами терапевтического окна; вторая — нарушение проходимости сосудов мозга в зоне поражения затрудняет или делает невозможным доставку препарата в зону пенумбры. Выходом из данного положения является интраназальный путь применения лекарств, характерный для аналогов регуляторных пептидов, в частности олигопептида с последовательностью метионил-глутамил-гистидил-фенилаланил-пролил-глицил-пролин (H-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-OH, MGHPPGP). Проведенный обзор клинических исследований свидетельствует о том, что в терапии ишемического инсульта олигопептид MGHPPGP клинически эффективен как в остром, так и в восстановительном периоде инсульта. Клиническая эффективность MGHPPGP была показана как при атеротромботическом, так и при кардиоэмболическом подтипах инсульта, на фоне нарушения кровотока как в каротидной, так и в вертебрально-базилярной системе. 2,5-diketopiperazines (DKPs) are cyclic dipeptides ubiquitously found in nature. In particular, cyclo(Phe-Pro), cyclo(Leu-Pro), and cyclo(Val-Pro) are frequently detected in many microbial cultures. Each of these DKPs has four possible stereoisomers due to the presence of two chirality centers. However, absolute configurations of natural DKPs are often ambiguous due to the lack of a simple, sensitive, and reproducible method for stereochemical assignment. This is an important problem because stereochemistry is a key determinant of biological activity. Here, we report a synthetic DKP library containing all stereoisomers of cyclo(Phe-Pro), cyclo(Leu-Pro), and cyclo(Val-Pro). The library was subjected to spectroscopic characterization using mass spectrometry, NMR, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). It turned out that ECD can clearly differentiate DKP stereoisomers. Thus, our ECD dataset can serve as a reference for unambiguous stereochemical assignment of cyclo(Phe-Pro), cyclo(Leu-Pro), and cyclo(Val-Pro) samples from natural sources. The DKP library was also subjected to a biological screening using assays for 	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.0346161, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -1.9743013e-05, ' FOOD': -0.0011297365}
486	Tyr-pro	PUBMED	 The transport and accumulation of orally administered functional food-derived peptides in the brain was not fully explored. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to provide critical evidence regarding brain accumulation of a memory-improving soy dipeptide, Tyr-Pro, following oral administration. Stable isotope-labeled Tyr-Pro (Tyr-[ The dipeptide Tyr-Pro has physiological potential for intact transportability into the brain parenchyma, prevention of cognitive impairment, and an adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) agonistic effect. The present study aimed to understand the effect of Tyr-Pro on the acetylcholine (ACh) nervous system and its underlying mechanism in NE-4C nerve cells. Concentration-dependent ACh production was induced by stimulation with Tyr-Pro and AdipoRon (an AdipoR1 agonist), along with the expression of AdipoR1 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in NE-4C cells. By knocking down AdipoR1 in the cells, Tyr-Pro promoted ChAT expression, along with the activations of AMPK and ERK 1/2. Tyr-Pro did not alter acetylcholinesterase or ACh receptors, indicating that the dipeptide might operate as an ACh accelerator in nerve cells. This study provides the first evidence that the AdipoR1 agonistic Tyr-Pro is a promising dipeptide responsible for the stimulation of the ACh nervous system by AdipoR1-induced ChAT activation. In our previous study, yeast-derived peptide Tyr-Pro-Leu-Pro (YPLP) was found to prolong treadmill time and relieve muscle fatigue in ICR mice. The present study aimed to further investigate the antifatigue mechanism of YPLP. Three doses of YPLP (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg·d) were given to exercise mice for 4 weeks. Results showed that YPLP reduced the oxidative response via the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway and promoted energy metabolism through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Label-free proteomics results showed that 81 differential abundance proteins (DAPs) were regulated by high-dose YPLP. These DAPs belonged to proteasome, mitochondrial, and muscle proteins. YPLP was mainly involved in proteasome, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, focal adhesion, and MAPK signal pathways to enhance muscle endurance. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting results proved that YPLP upregulated Psmd14 expression and downregulated p38 MAPK expression. Overall, this study revealed the mechanism behind YPLP to alleviate exercise fatigue.	MEDICAL, FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -0.00808317, 'OD': 0.0}
487	2'-deoxyadenosine	PUBMED	 Among various kinds of fluorine-substituted biomolecules, 2-fluoroadenine (2FA) and its derivatives have been actively investigated as therapeutic reagents, radio-sensitizers, and  2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA) is a new antimetabolite with very promising effect in the treatment of chronic lymphoproliferative diseases. It has also been shown to have good activity in acute myelogenous leukemia in children. CdA induces DNA single strand breaks and poly(ADP)-ribosylation, apoptosis and is cytotoxic to non-proliferating as well as proliferating cells. Earlier, CdA has only been given as continuous infusion. Recently, however, pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the bioavailability of oral CdA is 50% and of s.c. injection 100%. Furthermore, studies of the intracellular pharmacokinetics shows that there is a prolonged retention of its nucleotide metabolites supporting intermittent dosing.

488	Sitagliptin	WIKIPEDIA	"Sitagliptin, sold under the brand name Januvia among others, is an anti-diabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. In the United Kingdom it is listed as less preferred than metformin or a sulfonylurea. It is taken by mouth. It is also available in the fixed-dose combination medication sitagliptin/metformin (Janumet, Janumet XR). Common side effects include headaches, swelling of the legs, and upper respiratory tract infections. Serious side effects may include angioedema, low blood sugar, kidney problems, pancreatitis, and joint pain. Whether use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe is unclear. It is in the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class and works by increasing the production of insulin and decreasing the production of glucagon by the pancreas. Sitagliptin was developed by Merck & Co. and approved for medical use in the United States in 2006. In 2022, it was the 86th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Sitagliptin is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It is generally less preferred than metformin or sulfonylureas. It is taken by mouth. It is also available as the fixed-dose combinations of sitagliptin/metformin (Janumet, Janumet XR) and sitagliptin/simvastatin (Juvisync). Sitagliptin should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes. In December 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved labeling changes stating that Januvia (sitagliptin), Janumet (sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride), and Janumet XR (sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release) are not proven to improve glycemic (blood sugar) control in children aged 10 to 17 with type 2 diabetes. The drugs are approved to improve blood sugar control in adults aged 18 and older with type 2 diabetes. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects from sitagliptin are similar to placebo, except for rare nausea, common cold-like symptoms, and photosensitivity. It does not increase the risk of diarrhea. No significant difference exists in the occurrence of hypoglycemia between placebo and sitagliptin. In those taking sulphonylureas, the risk of low blood sugar is increased. The existence of rare case reports of kidney failure and hypersensitivity reactions is noted in the United States prescribing information, but a causative role for sitagliptin has not been established. Several postmarketing reports of pancreatitis (some fatal) have been made in people treated with sitagliptin and other DPP-4 inhibitors, and the US FDA package insert carries a warning to this effect, although the causal link between sitagliptin and pancreatitis has not yet been fully substantiated. One study with lab rats published in 2009 concluded that some of the possible risks of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer may be reduced when it is used with metformin. However, while DPP-4 inhibitors showed an increase in such risk factors, as of 2009, no increase in pancreatic cancer has been reported in individuals taking DPP-4 inhibitors. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a new warning and precaution about the risk of ""severe and disabling"" joint pain to the labels of all DPP-4 inhibitor medicines. == Mechanism of action == Sitagliptin works to competitively inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4). This enzyme breaks down the incretins GLP-1 and GIP, gastrointestinal hormones released in response to a meal. By preventing breakdown of GLP-1 and GIP, they are able to increase the secretion of insulin and suppress the release of glucagon by the alpha cells of the pancreas. This drives blood glucose levels towards normal. As the blood glucose level approaches normal, the amounts of insulin released and glucagon suppressed diminishes, thus tending to prevent an ""overshoot"" and subsequent low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which is seen with some other oral hypoglycemic agents. Sitagliptin has been shown to lower HbA1c level by about 0.7% points versus placebo. It is slightly less effective than metformin when used as a monotherapy. It does not cause weight gain and has less hypoglycemia compared to sulfonylureas. Sitagliptin is recommended as a second-line drug (in combination with other drugs) after the combination of diet/exercise and metformin fails. == History == Sitagliptin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2006, and is sold under the brand name Januvia. In April 2007, the FDA approved an oral combination of sitagliptin/metformin sold under the brand name Janumet. In October 2011, the FDA approved an oral combination of sitagliptin/simvastatin sold under the brand name Juvisync. The extended release version of sitagliptin/metformin was approved in February 2012. == External links == Media related to Sitagliptin at Wikimedia Commons == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
489	Doxazosin	WIKIPEDIA	Doxazosin, sold under the brand name Cardura among others, is a medication used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate), hypertension (high blood pressure), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For high blood pressure, it is a less preferred option. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, swelling, nausea, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. Severe side effects may include low blood pressure with standing, an irregular heart beat, and priapism. It is a selective α1-adrenergic blocker in the quinazoline class of compounds. Doxazosin was patented in 1977 and came into medical use in 1988. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 180th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === High blood pressure === Doxazosin is usually added to other antihypertensive therapy such as calcium channel antagonists, diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers. Doxazosin is generally considered to be safe, well tolerated and effective as an add-on (adjunctive) antihypertensive drug. Like other alpha-1 receptor antagonists, it has a role in the peri-operative management of pheochromocytoma. === Benign prostatic hyperplasia === Doxazosin is considered to be effective in reducing urinary symptom scores and improving peak urinary flow in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The bladder neck is densely packed with alpha-1 receptors. === PTSD nightmares and flashbacks === Sympatholytic drugs, including prazosin and doxazosin, are used for nightmares and flashbacks in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Doxazosin is very well tolerated for this constellation of symptoms. Given its long half-life, doxazosin lasts much longer than prazosin. While prazosin is dosed up to 4 times daily, doxazosin is generally dosed only once daily (at night). Both are alpha-1 antagonists. Other sympatholytic drugs include clonidine and guanfacine, which are alpha-2 agonists; they are not in the same exact class as doxazosin and prazosin. == History == The Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study stopped its arm of the trial looking at alpha blockers, because doxazosin was less effective than a simple diuretic, and because patients on doxazosin had a 25% higher rate of cardiovascular disease and twice the rate of congestive heart failure as patients on diuretics. Pfizer, aware of the results before publication, launched a marketing campaign in early 2000, and sales were largely unaffected, despite the dangers highlighted by the study. The decision to stop the trial was controversial because the higher rate of heart failure (HF) in the doxazosin group could have been caused by misdiagnosis due to fluid retention from the medication, or because patients with existing HF stopped their diuretic treatment to switch to doxazosin. However, in the later ASCOT trial, where doxazosin was used as a third-line treatment, there was no increase in HF risk. == Society and culture == === Brand names === In the US, Cardura is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == Research == A 2021 study associated doxazosin with decelerated biological aging in humans and confirmed its causal role in longevity in C. elegans. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
490	Inosine	WIKIPEDIA	Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. It was discovered in 1965 in analysis of RNA transferase. Inosine is commonly found in tRNAs and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs. Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism. Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including granulomatosis with polyangiitis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMD) inhibition. == Reactions == Adenine is converted to adenosine or inosine monophosphate (IMP), either of which, in turn, is converted into inosine (I), which pairs with adenine (A), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase intraconverts inosine and hypoxanthine. Inosine is also an intermediate in a chain of purine nucleotide reactions required for muscle movements. == Clinical significance == Subsequent studies in humans suggest that inosine supplementation has no effect on athletic performance. Animal studies have suggested that inosine has neuroprotective properties. It has been proposed for spinal cord injury and for administration after stroke, because observation suggests that inosine induces axonal rewiring. After ingestion, inosine is metabolized into uric acid, which has been suggested to be a natural antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenger with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Peroxynitrite has been correlated with axon degeneration In 2003, a study was initiated at the University of Pennsylvania MS Center to determine whether raising the levels of uric acid by the administration of inosine would slow the progression of MS. The study was completed in 2006 but the results were not reported to NIH. A subsequent publication hinted at potential benefits but the sample size (16 patients) was too small for a definitive conclusion. In addition, the side effect of the treatment was the development of kidney stones in four of 16 patients. With phase II trials for Parkinson's disease completed, inosine will continue to phase III trials. Earlier trials suggested that patients with the highest serum urate levels had slower progression of Parkinson's symptoms. The trial uses inosine to raise urate levels in those with levels lower than the population mean (6 mg/dL). Alseres Pharmaceuticals (named Boston Life Sciences when patent was granted) patented the use of inosine to treat stroke and was investigating the drug in the MS setting. In the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, it is classified as an antiviral. == Binding == Inosine is a natural ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA A receptor. == Biotechnology == When designing primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine is useful in that it can pair with any natural base. This allows for design of primers that span a single-nucleotide polymorphism, without the polymorphism disrupting the primer's annealing efficiency. However, inosine pairs preferentially with cytosine (C) and its introduction to RNA, e.g. by the action of ADARs, thereby destabilizes double-stranded RNA by changing AU base-pairs to IU mismatches. == Fitness == Despite lack of clinical evidence that it improves muscle development, inosine remains an ingredient in some fitness supplements. == Feeding stimulant == Inosine has also been found to be an important feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some species of farmed fish. For example, inosine and inosine 5-monophosphate have been reported as specific feeding stimulants for turbot fry, (Scophthalmus maximus) and Japanese amberjack, (Seriola quinqueradiata). The main problem of using inosine and/or inosine-5-monophosphate as feeding attractants is their high cost. However, their use may be economically justified within larval feeds for marine fish larvae during the early weaning period, since the total quantity of feed consumed is relatively small. == See also == Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase Inosine pranobex Nucleobase == References == == External links == PDR health study	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD	{'MED': -0.43420494, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.0015624772, ' EN': -0.03676063, 'DO': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ' FOOD': -0.00095850864}
491	Ramipril	WIKIPEDIA	"Ramipril, sold under the brand name Altace among others, is an ACE inhibitor type medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It can also be used as a preventative medication in patients over 55 years old to reduce the risk of having a heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death in patients shown to be at high risk, such as some diabetics and patients with vascular disease. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and cough. Serious side effects may include liver problems, angioedema, kidney problems, and high blood potassium. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an ACE inhibitor and works by decreasing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity. Ramipril was patented in 1981 and approved for medical use in 1989. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 187th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Activation and binding == Ramipril is a pro-drug. The molecule must be hydrolyzed by an esterase at the OCH2CH3 and form a carboxylate. This carboxylate then interacts with the positive Zn2+ ion which is located at the active site of the ACE enzyme. Ramipril is similar in structure to another ACE Inhibitor, trandolapril, but it has a second cyclopentane ring instead of a cyclohexane ring. == Medical uses == Medical uses include: High blood pressure (Hypertension) Congestive heart failure Following heart attack in people with evidence of heart failure People over 55 years at high risk: prevention of heart attack, stroke, cardiovascular death, or in need of revascularization procedures Prevent the onset and/or delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease, with or without proteinuria. Randomized trial evidence suggests that a maximum tolerable dose prevents cardiovascular events and death in patients with diabetic kidney disease. == Contraindications == Contraindications to its use include volume-depleted patients, a history of angioedema while on an ACE inhibitor, pregnancy and hypotension. People should not take ramipril (or any ACE inhibitors) if they have hyperkalemia. It is also recommended to avoid using salt-substitutes as this can further increase potassium levels in the blood. Ramipril can be considered in patients with bilateral or unilateral significant renal artery stenosis (RAS). An early rise in serum creatinine above baseline is expected after initiation of therapy with Ramipril, however, monitoring serum biochemistry and renal function after initiation is crucial. Treatment with Ramipril in some patients with significant narrowing in both kidneys can increase serum creatinine concentration (measured in the blood test), which returns to baseline upon therapy cessation. == Adverse effects == Shakiness Dry cough Dizziness and lightheadedness due to low blood pressure Fatigue, especially in the early stages Mouth dryness in the early stages Nausea Fainting Signs of infection (e.g., fever, chills, persistent sore throat) Chest pain Neutropenia (low white blood cells) Impotence (erectile dysfunction) Hyperkalemia Serious allergic reactions to this drug are unlikely, but immediate medical attention must be sought if they occur. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction include, but are not limited to a rash or swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, or throat. In extreme cases, ramipril may lead to potentially fatal liver problems. == Mechanism of action == ACE inhibitors inhibit the actions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), thereby lowering the production of angiotensin II and decreasing the breakdown of bradykinin. The decrease in angiotensin II results in relaxation of arteriole smooth muscle leading to a decrease in total peripheral resistance, reducing blood pressure as the blood is pumped through widened vessels. Its effect on bradykinin is responsible for the dry cough side effect. Ramipril, a prodrug or precursor drug, is converted to the active metabolite ramiprilat by carboxylesterase 1. Ramiprilat is mostly excreted by the kidneys. Its half-life is variable (3–16 hours), and is prolonged by heart and liver failure, as well as kidney failure. Peak effect occurs between 3 and 6 hours after dosing, with approximately 50% of this effect retained after 24 hours. == Synthesis == The penultimate step in the synthesis of ramipril combines an alanine derivative with a (S,S,S)-2-azabicyclo-[3.3.0]-octane-3-carboxylic acid protected as its benzyl ester. In the original patented route, these components were obtained by a multi-step process. The acid chloride forms an amide bond with the amino group of the pyrrolidine ring in the presence of triethylamine and ramipril is the product after the benzyl ester has been removed by hydrogenation. == Society and culture == === US patent === The compound was protected by a patent which was assigned to the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst AG (since merged into Aventis) on 29 October 1991. The patent was scheduled to expire on 29 October 2008. On 11 September 2007, in an appeal by the Indian company Lupin Ltd., the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed a district court trial verdict and found that Aventis's patent on ramipril was invalid for ""obviousness"", opening this drug to generic manufacturers. === Brand names === Ramipril is marketed as Prilace by Arrow Pharmaceuticals in Australia, Ramipro by Westfield Pharma in the Philippines, Triatec by Sanofi-Aventis in Italy and United States and Altace by King Pharmaceuticals in the United States, Novapril by Pharmanova in Ghana, Ramitens by PharmaSwiss, Ampril by Krka in Slovenia, Corpril by Cemelog-BRS in Hungary, Piramil and Prilinda by Hemofarm in Serbia, by Lek in Poland and by Novartis and Opsonin Pharma Limited as Ramace in Bangladesh, and in Canada as Altace (Sanofi-Aventis) and Ramipril (Pharmascience). Ramipril is marketed in India under the brand names Cardace, Zigpril, Ramistar, Odipril and Zorem . Ramipril is marketed in Myanmar under brand name Endpril . == Research == The 2001 Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation trial seemed to show ramipril possessed cardioprotective qualities which extended beyond its qualities as an antihypertensive. However, the trial and the interpretation of its results have been criticised. The Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) trial showed a 27% reduction in mortality for patients receiving ramipril for chronic heart failure following a myocardial infarction. Ramipril was found to have similar results as telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07}
492	Lisinopril	WIKIPEDIA	"Lisinopril is a medication belonging to the drug class of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), heart failure, and heart attacks. For high blood pressure it is usually a first-line treatment. It is also used to prevent kidney problems in people with diabetes mellitus. Lisinopril is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). Full effect may take up to four weeks to occur. Common side effects include headache, dizziness, feeling tired, cough, nausea, and rash. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, hyperkalemia (high blood potassium), and angioedema. Use is not recommended during the entire duration of pregnancy as it may harm the baby. Lisinopril works by inhibiting the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Lisinopril was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1987. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the third most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 82 million prescriptions. It is available in combination with amlodipine (as lisinopril/amlodipine) and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (as lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide). == Medical uses == Lisinopril is typically used for the treatment of high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy and after acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). Lisinopril is part of the ACE inhibitors drug class. Lisinopril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, adjunctive therapy for heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction. == Contraindications == Lisinopril is contraindicated in people who have a history of angioedema (hereditary or idiopathic) or who have diabetes and are taking aliskiren. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include headache, dizziness, feeling tired, cough, nausea, and rash. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, hyperkalemia, and angioedema. Use is not recommended during the entire duration of pregnancy as it may harm the baby. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Animal and human data have revealed evidence of harm to the embryo and teratogenicity associated with ACE inhibitors. == Interactions == === Dental care === ACE-inhibitors like lisinopril are considered to be generally safe for people undergoing routine dental care, though the use of lisinopril prior to dental surgery is more controversial, with some dentists recommending discontinuation the morning of the procedure. People may present to dental care suspicious of an infected tooth, but the swelling around the mouth may be due to lisinopril-induced angioedema, prompting emergency and medical referral. == Pharmacology == Lisinopril is the lysine-analog of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril. Unlike other ACE inhibitors, it is not a prodrug, is not metabolized by the liver, and is excreted unchanged in the urine. === Mechanism of action === Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, meaning it blocks the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), preventing angiotensin I from being converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent direct vasoconstrictor and a stimulator of aldosterone release. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II results in relaxation of the arterioles. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II also reduces the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which allows the kidney to excrete sodium along with water into the urine and increases the retention of potassium ions. Specifically, this process occurs in the peritubular capillaries of the kidneys in response to a change in Starling forces. The inhibition of the RAAS system causes an overall decrease in blood pressure. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about seven hours, although there was a trend to a small delay in time taken to reach peak serum concentrations in acute myocardial infarction patients. The peak effect of lisinopril is about 6 hours after administration for most people. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase, which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and the absorbed drug is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25% (reduced to 16% in people with New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) Class II–IV heart failure), with large interpatient variability (6 to 60%) at all doses tested (5 to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not affected by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats result in little or no accumulation in brain tissue. ==== Distribution ==== Lisinopril does not bind to proteins in the blood. It does not distribute as well in people with NYHA Class II–IV heart failure. ==== Elimination ==== Lisinopril leaves the body completely unchanged in the urine. The half-life of lisinopril is 12 hours, and is increased in people with kidney problems. While the plasma half-life of lisinopril has been estimated between 12 and 13 hours, the elimination half-life is much longer, at around 30 hours. The full duration of action is between 24 and 30 hours. Lisinopril is the only water-soluble member of the ACE inhibitor class and thus has no metabolism by the liver. === Chemistry === Pure lisinopril powder is white to off-white in color. Lisinopril is soluble in water (approximately 13 mg/L at room temperature), less soluble in methanol, and virtually insoluble in ethanol. == History == Captopril, the first ACE inhibitor, is a functional and structural analog of a peptide derived from the venom of the jararaca, a Brazilian pit viper (Bothrops jararaca). Enalapril is a derivative, designed by scientists at Merck to overcome the rash and bad taste caused by captopril.: 12–13 Enalapril is actually a prodrug; the active metabolite is enalaprilat. The di-acid metabolite of enalapril, enalaprilat, and its lysine analogue lisinopril are potent inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE); they do not contain sulphydryl groups. Both drugs can be assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography and by radioimmunoassay and plasma ACE inhibition remains stable under normal storage conditions. It is therefore possible to study their pharmacokinetics as well as their pharmacodynamic effects in humans. Enalaprilat and lisinopril as well as ACE activity have been measured in blood taken during the course of two studies of the effects of these drugs on blood pressure and autonomic responsiveness. Lisinopril is a synthetic peptide derivative of captopril. Scientists at Merck created lisinopril by systematically altering each structural unit of enalaprilat, substituting various amino acids. Adding lysine at one end of the drug turned out to have strong activity and adequate bioavailability when given orally; analogs of that compound resulted in lisinopril, which takes its name from the discovery of lysine. Merck conducted clinical trials, and the drug was approved for hypertension in 1987 and congestive heart failure in 1993. The discovery posed a problem, since sales of enalapril were strong for Merck, and the company did not want to diminish those sales. Merck ended up entering into an agreement with Zeneca under which Zeneca received the right to co-market lisinopril, and Merck received the exclusive rights to an earlier stage aldose reductase inhibitor drug candidate, a potential diabetes treatment. Zeneca's marketing and brand name, ""Zestril"", turned out to be stronger than Merck's effort. The drug became a blockbuster for AstraZeneca (formed in 1998), with annual sales in 1999 of $1.2B. The US patents expired in 2002. Since then, lisinopril has been available under many brand names worldwide; it is also available in combination drugs with diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (as lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide), and with calcium channel blocker amlodipine (as lisinopril/amlodipine). == Society and culture == === Legal status === In July 2016, an oral solution formulation of lisinopril was approved for use in the United States. == References == == Further reading =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
494	Tyr-phe	PUBMED	 Neuronal damage in bacterial meningitis (BM) partly stems from the host´s inflammatory response and induced oxidative stress (OS). We studied the association of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers indicating oxidative damage to proteins with course of illness and outcome in childhood BM in Angola. Ortho-tyrosine/phenylalanine (o-Tyr/Phe), 3-chlorotyrosine/para-tyrosine (3Cl-Tyr/p-Tyr), and 3-nitrotyrosine/para-tyrosine (3NO The micelle formation of Tyr-Phe dipeptide and Val-Tyr-Val tripeptide has been studied for the first time. The aggregation numbers were determined for both the peptides in aqueous solution and in the presence of SDS and PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer additive environments. The results obtained by steady state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopic techniques are in good agreement with each other. The higher value of aggregation number confirms the formation of mixed micelles. The fluorescence lifetime of tyrosine in various micellar and mixed micellar systems were also determined. The decreased lifetime values with the quencher suggested the dynamic nature of the quenching process. However, the possibility of static quenching cannot be ruled out. The accessibility of DPC quencher was found to be more in dipeptide than tripeptide. The aggregation properties of Tyr-Phe dipeptide and Val-Tyr-Val tripeptide were studied in aqueous solution and in the presence of SDS and SDS-polymer environments using UV-visible, surface tension, fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) techniques. Both the peptides formed micelles. The cmc values obtained for dipeptide and tripeptide are 2×10(-5) and 4×10(-5) M, respectively in aqueous solution at 25°C. The presence of additives (SDS and polymer) hindered the micelle formation of peptides. The cmc values obtained by various methods are in good agreement with each other. Effect of peptides on the aggregation properties of SDS also was investigated. The cmc of SDS was decreased in presence of peptides and were reduced with increase in temperature. Using monophasic micellization concept, the association constant (K(A)) for the SDS-peptide mixed micellar systems was determined. Using biphasic model, the thermodynamic parameters viz; ΔG°(m), ΔH°(m) and ΔS°(m) for SDS-water and SDS-peptide-water mixed micellar systems, the standard free energy for transfer of SDS from aqueous to peptide additive environments were estimated at various temperatures. These results suggest that the SDS is more stable in micellized form in the SDS-water-peptide ternary systems compared to the situation in the corresponding SDS-water binary systems.

499	Phenylacetylglutamine	WIKIPEDIA	Phenylacetylglutamine is a product formed by the conjugation of phenylacetate and glutamine. It is a common metabolite that occurs naturally in human urine. The highly-nitrogenous compound is most commonly encountered in human subjects with urea cycle disorders,. These conditions, such as uremia or hyperammonemia, tend to cause high levels of nitrogen in the form of ammonia in the blood. Uremic conditions are a result of defects in enzymes that convert ammonia to urea, the primary nitrogenous waste metabolite in the urea cycle. == Metabolism == Phenylacetylglutamine is the primary metabolite of the degradation of phenylacetate when in the presence of glutamine in the liver. It is also produced in higher concentrations in the body through the metabolic degradation pathway of the pharmaceutical compounds sodium phenylbutyrate, glycerol phenylbutyrate, and sodium phenylacetate, considered more toxic, that are used as treatments for the physiological dysfunction in urea cycling. Phenylbutyrate is beta-oxidized into phenylacetate which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and excreted by the kidney. Phenylacetylglutamine is the product of uremic conditions that require an alternative pathway to the urea cycle for nitrogen waste removal. This process produces comparable levels of phenylacetylglutamine in urine in relation to urea levels in a properly functioning urea cycle. In 24 hours 80-100% of a dose of phenylbutyrate is excreted in the urine as phenylacetylglutamine. The metabolism and conjugation of phenylacetate with glutamine in the liver involves amino acid acetylation carried out by the enzyme phenylacetyltranferase or glutamine N-acetyl transferase. The enzyme catalyzes the reaction of the substrates phenylacetyl-CoA and L-glutamine to produce CoA and alpha-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine and phenylacetic acid. The catalytic enzyme has been isolated in the human liver mitochondria. Furthermore, phenylacetylglutamine has been found in human urine, but not in the excretory material of rats, dogs, cats, monkeys, sheep, or horses. Throughout the metabolic process, phenylacetylglutamine is bound and conjugated by free-plasma in the kidney to remove excess nitrogen through its excretion in the urine. == As a biomarker == Elevated levels of nitrogen in the blood increase the amount of glutamine, the primary, non-toxic carrier of ammonia in the blood, within patients with hyperammonemia and inborn errors in urea synthesis. Phenylacetylglutamine levels in the urine serves as a more effective biomarker for the excretion of nitrogenous waste than measures of blood plasma, which fluctuate and are a less effective therapeutic monitor of waste nitrogen levels. A 24-hour metabolic urine test of phenylacetylglutamine provides a non-invasive biomarker of waste nitrogen that most consistently reflects the dose of phenylbutyric acid or glycerol phenylbutyrate used to treat patients with urea-cycle disorders. Phenylacetylglutamine isotopically labeled with 14C also serves more broadly to characterize relative rates of cellular reactions and functions as a general, non-invasive biomarker for gluconeogenesis and citric acid cycle intermediates in the liver. == Chronic kidney disorder == High levels of phenylacetylglutamine in the urine following metabolism by the gut microbiota may also indicate early renal decline associated with kidney dysfunction and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In CKD, phenylacetylglutamine is considered a uremic toxin which is taken up, circulated and retained in the blood after microbial fermentation of certain proteins and amino acids in the gut. Blood serum levels of phenylacetylglutamine in CKD are used as a mortality determinant. Blood plasma levels of phenylacetylglutamine increase with exposure to cigarette smoke, in patients with ischemic heart failure, with cardiovascular risk or hypertension, in the development of renal disease, and in patients with type 2 diabetes. == See also == Glycerol phenylbutyrate Sodium phenylacetate Sodium phenylbutyrate == References ==	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.00058484543, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -0.0058657476, ' MED': -1.0280384e-06, 'ICAL': 0.0}
500	Glycyl-l-phenylalanine	PUBMED	 The structural and vibrational properties of the glycyl-L-phenylalanine dipeptide were investigated using vibrational spectroscopy (Raman and infrared) and first-principle calculations. Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed between 100 and 3200 cm Glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap), a cathepsin C substrate, induces an increase of the free and unsedimentable activities of this enzyme when incubated with a total mitochondrial fraction of rat liver. 1 mM-ZnSO4 considerably inhibits the cathepsin C total activity, measured with Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap as the substrate, in the presence of Triton X-100. The inhibition is markedly less pronounced when the free activity is determined; a high activity remains that depends on the integrity of the lysosomes; it decreases as the free activity of N-acetylglucosaminidase increases when lysosomes are subjected to treatments able to disrupt their membrane. Cathepsin C activity is reduced when thioethylamine hydrochloride is omitted from the incubation medium. Under these conditions at 37 degrees C, the free activity equals the total activity, although the lysosomes are intact, as indicated by the low free activity of N-acetylglucosaminidase. 1 mM-ZnSO4 strikingly inhibits the total activity, whereas more than 80% of the free activity remains. These observations are presented as evidence that Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap can possibly cause a disruption of the lysosomes as a result of its hydrolysis inside these organelles. In the presence of ZnSO4, intralysosomal hydrolysis becomes apparent, owing to a preferential inhibition by Zn2+ of extralysosomal hydrolysis; in the absence of thioethylamine hydrochloride, it is measurable because the disruption of lysosomes by Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap is delayed as a result of a slow-down of the reaction. The usefulness of Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap and related dipeptidyl naphthylamides in lysosomal-membrane-permeability studies is emphasized. The release by glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap) of endocytosed invertase associated with the MLP fraction (sum of the M, L and P fractions [de Duve, Pressman, Gianetto, Wattiaux & Appelmans (1955) Biochem. J. 63, 604-617]) of rat liver was investigated and compared with the release of cathepsin C. The percentage of invertase released increases with time after the enzyme injection, whereas the release of cathepsin C is not influenced by this treatment and corresponds to 85-90% of the total activity of the enzyme. It takes about 2h to attain a similar release of both enzymes. The quantity of invertase releasable or not by Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap was plotted against the time after the injection. Results agree well with the hypothesis that unreleasable invertase is associated with a pre-lysosomal compartment, whereas releasable invertase is present in lysosomes. A kinetic analysis indicates that invertase enters the pre-lysosomal compartment with a zero-order rate constant of 0.48 unit/min per g fresh wt., and leaves this compartment with a first-order rate constant of 0.042 min-1.

501	Ser-phe	PUBMED	 The purpose of the study was to investigate the transepithelial transport route of Arg-Leu-Ser-Phe-Asn-Pro (RLSFNP), a milk-derived angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide, and to encapsulate RLSFNP in a liposome to improve its intestinal bioavailability. The transport route was investigated using transport inhibitors in a human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayer model. Sodium azide and wortmannin significantly reduced the permeability of RLSFNP ( P < 0.01), indicating that energy-dependent transcytosis is involved in the transport of RLSFNP across Caco-2 cells. The hexapeptide RLSFNP was then embedded in liposomes, and the RLSFNP liposome was characterized. Afterward, the cellular uptake and transepithelial transport ability of the RLSFNP liposome across Caco-2 cell monolayers was observed. The results demonstrated that the RLSFNP liposome was successfully prepared, having a significant sustained release and storage capability. The RLSFNP liposome can be absorbed by Caco-2 cells, with an increased intestinal absorption of RLSFNP compared to RLSFNP alone. The results showed a new way to improve RLSFNP intestinal bioavailability. The 1H and 13C n.m.r. spectra of Ac-Ser-Gly, Ala-Ser-Gly and Gly-Ser-Phe tripeptides have been measured and analysed at three different pD values. The n.m.r. parameters of Ser side-chain are nearly pD independent. C alpha H group (13C/1H) of Ser residue of Gly-Ser-Phe shows a consistent pD dependence in acid solutions. Conformational calculations on Ser side-chain show the growing importance of the gauche conformers on the overall conformation of the side-chain all along the three tripeptides. The alpha-subunit of interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor is a member of the hematopoietin receptor family. The alignment of its amino acid sequence with those of other members of this family (human somatotropin receptor/murine IL-3 receptor beta and human IL-2 receptor beta) has suggested that amino acids included in two SSFY repeats found in each of its hematopoietin receptor domains, contribute to the binding of the ligand. The involvement of these amino acids in IL-6 binding and signal transduction was studied by site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modelling. We present a computer-derived three-dimensional model of the IL-6/IL-6 receptor complex based on the structure of the human somatotropin/human somatotropin receptor complex. This model allowed the location of distinct regions important for IL-6 and gp130 binding. We show that some of the residues included in the SSFY repeats located in our IL-6 receptor model in the loops between beta-strands E and F of domain-I and B' and C', of domain-II, participate in the formation of a major IL-6-binding site. These residues are necessary for IL-6 and gp130 binding and for signal transduction. Using our IL-6 receptor mutants we mapped the epitopes of our anti-(IL-6 receptor) neutralising monoclonal antibodies to these residues. Our results demonstrate that a generic hematopoietin receptor family structural module can be used for the study of both alpha and beta receptor subunits belonging to this family.

505	Silodosin	WIKIPEDIA	"Silodosin, sold under the brand name Urief among others, is a medication used for the symptomatic treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It acts as an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist. The most common side effect is a reduction in the amount of semen released during ejaculation. == Medical uses == Silodosin is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. == Contraindications == Silodosin is contraindicated for people with kidney impairment or severe liver impairment. According to European labels, silodosin has no contraindications apart from known hypersensitivity. Another source names recurring urinary retention, recurring urinary infections, uncontrolled macrohematuria, bladder stones, hydronephrosis, combination with other α1-antagonists or dopamine agonists, and severe renal or hepatic impairment as contraindications. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), silodosin is contraindicated with paxlovid, a drug used in treating COVID-19. == Side effects == The most common adverse effect is loss of seminal emission. This seems to be caused by silodosin's high selectivity for α1A receptors. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome occurs in some people taking alpha adrenoreceptor antagonists and may lead to complications during cataract surgery. Other common adverse effects (in more than 1% of patients) are dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhea, and clogged nose. Less common (0.1–1%) are tachycardia (fast heartbeat), dry mouth, nausea, skin reactions, and erectile dysfunction. Hypersensitivity reactions occur in fewer than 0.01% of patients. There have been reports about intraoperative floppy iris syndrome during cataract extractions. == Interactions == Combining silodosin with strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, significantly increases its concentrations in the blood plasma and its area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)). Less potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem have a less pronounced effect on this parameters, which is not considered clinically significant. Inhibitors and inducers of the enzyme UGT2B7, alcohol dehydrogenases, and aldehyde dehydrogenases, as well as the transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), may also influence silodosin concentrations in the body. Digoxin, which is transported by P-gp, is not affected by silodosin; this means that silodosin does not significantly inhibit or induce P-gp. No relevant interactions with antihypertensive drugs or with PDE5 inhibitors have been found in studies; although combination with other α1-antagonists is not well studied. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Silodosin is an alpha adrenoreceptor antagonist. It works by blocking receptors called alpha-1A adrenoreceptors in the prostate gland, the bladder and the urethra (the tube that leads from the bladder to the outside of the body). When these receptors are activated, they cause the muscles controlling the flow of urine to contract. By blocking these receptors, silodosin allows these muscles to relax, making it easier to pass urine and relieving the symptoms of BPH. Silodosin has high affinity for the alpha1A-adrenergic receptor in the prostate, the bladder, and the prostatic urethra. By this mechanism, it relaxes the smooth muscles in these organs, easing urinary flow and other symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. === Pharmacokinetics === The absolute bioavailability after oral intake is 32%. Food has little effect on the area under the curve. When in the bloodstream, 96,6% of the substance are bound to blood plasma proteins. Its main metabolite is silodosin glucuronide, which inhibits the α1A receptor with 1/8 of the affinity of the parent substance. 91% of the glucuronide are bound to plasma proteins. The enzyme mainly responsible for the formation of the glucuronide is UGT2B7. Other enzymes involved in the metabolism are alcohol dehydrogenases, aldehyde dehydrogenases and CYP3A4. == History == Silodosin received its first marketing approval in Japan in May 2006, under the brand name Urief, which is jointly marketed by Kissei Pharmaceutical and Daiichi Sankyo. Kissei licensed the US, Canadian, and Mexican rights for silodosin to Watson Pharmaceuticals (now Allergan) in 2004. AbbVie absorbed Allergan in 2019. The FDA and Health Canada approved silodosin under the brand name Rapaflo in October 2008, and January 2011, respectively. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Other brand names include Urorec, Niksol, Silorel, , Rapilif, Silotrif, Sildoo, Silodal Silofast, Alphacept, Thrupas, and Flopadex. == Research == Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists are being investigated as a means to male birth control due to their ability to inhibit ejaculation but not orgasm. While silodosin was completely efficacious in preventing the release of semen in all subjects, 12 out of the 15 participants reported mild discomfort upon orgasm. The men also reported the psychosexual side effect of being strongly dissatisfied by their lack of ejaculation. == References == == Further reading == Kawabe K, Yoshida M, Homma Y (November 2006).

509	Ezetimibe	WIKIPEDIA	Ezetimibe, sold under the brand name Zetia among others, is a medication used to treat high blood cholesterol and certain other lipid abnormalities. Generally it is used together with dietary changes and a statin. Alone, it is less preferred than a statin. It is taken by mouth. It is also available in the fixed-dose combinations ezetimibe/simvastatin, ezetimibe/atorvastatin, ezetimibe/rosuvastatin, and ezetimibe/bempedoic acid. The most commonly reported adverse events include upper respiratory tract infections, joint pain, diarrhea, and tiredness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, liver problems, depression, and muscle breakdown. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. Ezetimibe works by decreasing cholesterol absorption in the intestines. Ezetimibe was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 79th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Adding ezetimibe to statin treatment of high blood cholesterol has no effect on overall mortality or cardiovascular mortality, although it significantly reduces the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Combining ezetimibe with simvastatin had no effect on overall mortality but did lower the risk of heart attack or stroke in people with prior heart attack. Several treatment guidelines recommend adding ezetimibe in select high risk persons in whom LDL goals cannot be achieved by maximally tolerated statin alone. Initiation of ezetimibe along with high-intensity statin therapy at the time of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event was associated with significantly better cholesterol reduction at day 7, 1-month, 3-months, and 1-year post-ACS event; which translated into significantly lower recurrent cardiovascular events (death from any cause, major ACS, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke) post the index event of ACS. Ezetimibe is indicated in the United States as an add-on to dietary measures to reduce levels of certain lipids in people with: Primary hyperlipidemia, alone or with a statin Mixed hyperlipidemia, in combination with fenofibrate Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in combination with specific statins Homozygous sitosterolemia A 2018 review found that ezetimibe used as sole treatment slightly lowered plasma levels of lipoprotein(a), but the effect was not large enough to be important. Ezetimibe improves the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score but the available evidence indicates it does not improve outcomes of hepatic steatosis. == Contraindications == The two contraindications to taking ezetimibe are a previous allergic reaction to it, including symptoms of rash, angioedema, anaphylaxis, and severe liver disease, especially when taken with a statin. Ezetimibe may have significant medication interactions with ciclosporin and with fibrates other than fenofibrate. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with ezetimibe therapy include headache and/or diarrhea (steatorrhea). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include myalgia and/or raised liver function test (ALT/AST) results. Rarely (<0.1% of patients), hypersensitivity reactions (rash, angioedema) or myopathy may occur. Cases of muscle problems (myalgia and rhabdomyolysis) have been reported and are included as warnings on the label for ezetimibe. Since NPC1L1 also regulates vitamin K uptake, the use of ezetimibe can lead to side effects in warfarin therapy. == Overdose == The incidence of overdose with ezetimibe is rare; subsequently, few data exist on the effects of overdose. However, an acute overdose of ezetimibe is expected to produce an exaggeration of its usual effects, leading to loose stools, abdominal pain, and fatigue. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Ezetimibe inhibits the absorption of cholesterol from the small intestine and decreases the amount of cholesterol normally available to liver cells. The lower levels of cholesterol in the liver cells lead them to absorb more cholesterol from circulation thus lowering the levels of circulating cholesterol. It blocks the critical mediator of cholesterol absorption, the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein on the gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells, as well as in hepatocytes; it blocks aminopeptidase N and interrupts a caveolin 1–annexin A2 complex involved in trafficking cholesterol. === Pharmacokinetics === Within 4–12 hours of the oral administration of a 10-mg dose to fasting adults, the attained mean ezetimibe peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 3.4–5.5 ng/ml. Following oral administration, ezetimibe is absorbed and extensively conjugated to a phenolic glucuronide (active metabolite). Mean Cmax (45–71 ng/ml) of ezetimibe-glucuronide is attained within 1–2 hours. The concomitant administration of food (high-fat vs. nonfat meals) does not affect the extent of absorption of ezetimibe. However, coadministration with a high-fat meal increases its Cmax by 38%. The absolute bioavailability cannot be determined, since ezetimibe is insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection. Ezetimibe and its active metabolites are highly bound to human plasma proteins (90%). Ezetimibe is primarily metabolized in the liver and the small intestine via glucuronide conjugation with subsequent renal and biliary excretion. Both the parent compound and its active metabolite are eliminated from plasma with a half-life of around 22 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing. Ezetimibe lacks significant inhibitor or inducer effects on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which explains its limited number of drug interactions. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with chronic kidney disease or mild hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh score 5–6). Due to insufficient data, the manufacturer does not recommend ezetimibe for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7–15). In patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the mean AUC values for total ezetimibe are increased about 1.7-fold, 3-to-4-fold, and 5-to-6-fold, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
511	Dofetilide	WIKIPEDIA	"Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent. It is marketed under the trade name Tikosyn by Pfizer, and is available in the United States in capsules containing 125, 250, and 500 μg of dofetilide. It is not available in Europe or Australia. == Medical uses == Dofetilide is used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in individuals prone to the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and flutter arrhythmias, and for chemical cardioversion to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and flutter. Based on the results of the Danish Investigations of Arrhythmias and Mortality on Dofetilide (""DIAMOND"") study, dofetilide does not affect mortality in the treatment of patients post-myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction, however it was shown to decrease all-cause readmissions as well as CHF-related readmissions. Because of the results of the DIAMOND study, some physicians use dofetilide in the suppression of atrial fibrillation in individuals with LV dysfunction, however use appears limited: After initially receiving marketing approval in Europe in 1999, Pfizer voluntarily withdrew this approval in 2004 for commercial reasons and it is not registered in other first world countries. It has clinical advantages over other class III antiarrhythmics in chemical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, and maintenance of sinus rhythm, and does not have the pulmonary or hepatotoxicity of amiodarone, however atrial fibrillation is not generally considered life-threatening, and dofetilide causes an increased rate of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in comparison to other therapies. == Contraindications == Prior to administration of the first dose, the corrected QT (QTc) must be determined. If the QTc is greater than 440 msec (or 500 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), dofetilide is contraindicated. If heart rate is less than 60 bpm, the uncorrected QT interval should be used. After each subsequent dose of dofetilide, QTc should be determined and dosing should be adjusted. If at any time after the second dose of dofetilide the QTc is greater than 500 msec (550 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), dofetilide should be discontinued. == Adverse effects == Torsades de pointes is the most serious side effect of dofetilide therapy. The incidence of torsades de pointes is 0.3-10.5% and is dose-related, with increased incidence associated with higher doses. The majority of episodes of torsades de pointes have occurred within the first three days of initial dosing. Patients should be hospitalized and monitored for the first three days after starting dofetilide. The risk of inducing torsades de pointes can be decreased by taking precautions when initiating therapy, such as hospitalizing individuals for a minimum of three days for serial creatinine measurement, continuous telemetry monitoring and availability of cardiac resuscitation. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Dofetilide works by selectively blocking the rapid component of the delayed rectifier outward potassium current (IKr). This causes the refractory period of atrial tissue to increase, hence its effectiveness in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Dofetilide does not affect dV/dTmax (the slope of the upstroke of phase 0 depolarization), conduction velocity, or the resting membrane potential. There is a dose-dependent increase in the QT interval and the corrected QT interval (QTc). Because of this, many practitioners will initiate dofetilide therapy only on individuals under telemetry monitoring or if serial EKG measurements of QT and QTc can be performed. === Pharmacokinetics === Peak plasma concentrations are seen two to three hours after oral dosing when fasting. Dofetilide is well absorbed in its oral form, with a bioavailability of >90%. Intravenous administration of dofetilide is not available in the United States. The elimination half-life of dofetilide is roughly 10 hours; however, this varies based on many physiologic factors (most significantly creatinine clearance), and ranges from 4.8 to 13.5 hours. Due to the significant level of renal elimination (80% unchanged, 20% metabolites), the dose of dofetilide must be adjusted to prevent toxicity due to impaired renal function. Dofetilide is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 enzymes predominantly in the liver and GI tract. This means that it is likely to interact with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, or ketoconazole, resulting in higher and potentially toxic levels of dofetilide. ==== Metabolism ==== A steady-state plasma level of dofetilide is achieved in 2–3 days. 80% of dofetilide is excreted by the kidneys, so the dose of dofetilide should be adjusted in individuals with chronic kidney disease, based on creatinine clearance. In the kidneys, dofetilide is eliminated via cation exchange (secretion). Agents that interfere with the renal cation exchange system, such as verapamil, cimetidine, hydrochlorothiazide, itraconazole, ketoconazole, prochlorperazine, and trimethoprim should not be administered to individuals taking dofetilide. About 20 percent of dofetilide is metabolized in the liver via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Drugs that interfere with the activity of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme can increase serum dofetilide levels. If the renal cation exchange system is interfered with (as with the medications listed above), a larger percentage of dofetilide is cleared via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme system. == History == After its initial US FDA approval, due to the pro-arrhythmic potential, it was only made available to hospitals and prescribers that had received education and undergone specific training in the risks of treatment with dofetilide; however, this restriction was subsequently removed in 2016. == See also == Antiarrhythmic agents Cardiac action potential Electrocardiogram == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
512	Chlorogenic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is the ester of caffeic acid and (−)-quinic acid, functioning as an intermediate in lignin biosynthesis. The term chlorogenic acids refers to a related polyphenol family of esters, including hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic acid, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid) with quinic acid. Despite the ""chloro"" of the name, chlorogenic acids contain no chlorine. Instead, the name comes from the Greek χλωρός (khloros, light green) and -γένος (genos, a suffix meaning ""giving rise to""), pertaining to the green color produced when chlorogenic acids are oxidized. == Structural properties == Structurally, chlorogenic acid is the ester formed between caffeic acid and the 3-hydroxyl of L-quinic acid. Isomers of chlorogenic acid include the caffeoyl ester at other hydroxyl sites on the quinic acid ring: 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (cryptochlorogenic acid or 4-CQA) and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (neochlorogenic acid or 5-CQA). The epimer at position 1 has not yet been reported. Structures having more than one caffeic acid group are called isochlorogenic acids, and can be found in coffee. There are several isomers, such as 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid. and cynarine (1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid) == Biosynthesis and natural occurrence == The biosynthetic precursor to chlorogenic acid is 4-coumaroyl-CoA, containing a single hydroxyl group on the aryl ring, which in turn is produced from cinnamic acid. The hydroxylation of the coumaryl ester, i.e. installing the second hydroxy group, is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. Chlorogenic acid can be found in the bamboo Phyllostachys edulis, as well as in many other plants, such as the shoots of common heather (Calluna vulgaris). === In food === Chlorogenic acid and the related compounds cryptochlorogenic acid, and neochlorogenic acid have been found in the leaves of Hibiscus sabdariffa. Isomers of chlorogenic acid are found in potatoes. Chlorogenic acid is present in the flesh of eggplants, peaches, prunes and coffee beans. == Research and safety == Chlorogenic acid is under preliminary research for its possible biological effects. Chlorogenic acid has not been approved as a prescription drug or food additive recognized as a safe ingredient for foods or beverages. There is not enough evidence to determine whether it is safe or effective for human health, and its use in high doses, such as excessive consumption of green coffee, may have adverse effects. == Nomenclature == The atom-numbering of chlorogenic acid can be ambiguous. The order of numbering of atoms on the quinic acid ring was reversed in 1976 following IUPAC guidelines, with the consequence that 3-CQA became 5-CQA, and 5-CQA became 3-CQA. This article uses the original numbering, which was exclusive prior to 1976, (chlorogenic acid being 3-CQA, while neochlorogenic acid is 5-CQA). Thereafter researchers and manufacturers have been divided, with both numbering systems in use. Even the 1976 IUPAC recommendations are not entirely satisfactory when applied to some of the less common chlorogenic acids. == References =="	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -9.0883464e-07, 'OD': 0.0}
513	Pravastatin	WIKIPEDIA	Pravastatin, sold under the brand name Pravachol among others, is a statin medication, used for preventing cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and treating abnormal lipids. It is suggested to be used together with diet changes, exercise, and weight loss. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include joint pain, diarrhea, nausea, headaches, and muscle pains. Serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis, liver problems, and diabetes. Use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Like all statins, pravastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol. Pravastatin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1989. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 37th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 16 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Pravastatin is primarily used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels. Pravastatin has been found to have a similar effectiveness at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as fluvastatin but evidence indicates that pravastatin may not be as effective as other statin medications. The beneficial effect of pravastatin is dependent on the dose and the potential for side effects or unwanted effects from this medication are not clear from clinical trials. == Adverse effects and contraindications == Pravastatin has undergone over 112,000 patient-years of double-blind, randomized trials using the 40 mg, once-daily dose and placebos. These trials indicate pravastatin is well tolerated and displays few noncardiovascular abnormalities in patients. Contraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with pravastatin, include pregnancy and breastfeeding. Taking pravastatin while pregnant could lead to birth defects. While the amount of pravastatin ingested by an infant from breastfeeding is low, patients breastfeeding should not take pravastatin due to potential effects on the infant's lipid metabolism. == Drug interactions == Medications that should not be taken with pravastatin include, but are not limited to: Cimetidine (Tagamet) Colchicine (Colcrys) Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) Ketoconazole (Nizoral) Additional cholesterol-lowering medications such as: fenofibrate (Tricor), gemfibrozil (Lopid), cholestyramine (Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar), and niacin (nicotinic acid, Niacor, Niaspan); Specific HIV protease inhibitors such as: lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra), and ritonavir (Norvir) taken with darunavir (Prezista); and spironolactone (Aldactone). The combination of fenofibrate with pravastatin is approved for use in the European Union. == Mechanism of action == Pravastatin acts as a lipoprotein-lowering drug through two pathways. In the major pathway, pravastatin inhibits the function of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. As a reversible competitive inhibitor, pravastatin sterically hinders the action of HMG-CoA reductase by occupying the active site of the enzyme. Taking place primarily in the liver, this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the rate-limiting step of the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. Pravastatin also inhibits the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins, which are the precursor to low-density lipoproteins (LDL). These reductions increase the number of cellular LDL receptors, thus LDL uptake increases, removing it from the bloodstream. == Pharmacokinetics == Oral bioavailability of pravastatin ranges from 17-34% with peak plasma concentration achieved 1-1.5 hours after administration. Absorption of drug is modestly decreased when taken with food however this does not reduce the clinical lipid-lowering effect. The 3α-hydroxyisomeric metabolite of pravastatin is also an active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with approximately 2.5-10% the potency of the parent compound. Pravastatin has a plasma half-life of 1.8 hours whereas this active metabolite has a half-life up to 77 hours. == History == Initially known as CS-514, pravastatin is a derivative of ML236B (compactin), which was identified in a fungus called Penicillium citrinum in the 1970s by researchers of the Sankyo Pharma Inc. It is being marketed outside Japan by the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 2005, Pravachol was the 22nd-highest selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales totaling $1.3 billion. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved generic pravastatin for use in the United States in April 2006. Generic pravastatin sodium tablets were manufactured by Biocon Ltd, India and Teva Pharmaceuticals in Kfar Sava, Israel. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -4.3202e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
514	Rosuvastatin	WIKIPEDIA	"Rosuvastatin, sold under the brand name Crestor among others, is a statin medication, used to prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and treat abnormal lipids. It is recommended to be used together with dietary changes, exercise, and weight loss. It is taken orally (by mouth). Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headaches, and muscle pains. Serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis, liver problems, and diabetes. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Like all statins, rosuvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in the liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol. Rosuvastatin was patented in 1991 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2003. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the thirteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 37 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == The primary use of rosuvastatin is for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and the treatment of abnormal lipids. === Effects on cholesterol levels === The effects of rosuvastatin on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin. Meta-analysis showed that rosuvastatin can modestly increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, as well as with other statins. A 2014 Cochrane review determined there was good evidence for rosuvastatin lowering non-HDL levels linearly with dose. == Side effects and contraindications == Side effects are uncommon: constipation heartburn dizziness sleeplessness depression joint pain cough memory loss or forgetfulness confusion The following rare side effects are more serious. Like all statins, rosuvastatin can possibly cause myopathy, rhabdomyolysis: muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness lack of energy fever chest pain jaundice: yellowing of the skin or eyes dark colored, or foamy urine pain in the upper right part of the abdomen nausea extreme tiredness weakness unusual bleeding or bruising loss of appetite flu-like symptoms sore throat, chills, or other signs of infection Allergic reactions can develop: rash hives itching difficulty breathing or swallowing swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs hoarseness numbness or tingling in fingers or toes Rosuvastatin has multiple contraindications, including hypersensitivity to rosuvastatin or any component of the formulation, active liver disease, elevation of serum transaminases, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Rosuvastatin is not prescribed nor used while pregnant, as it can cause serious harm to the fetus. In the case of breastfeeding, it is unknown whether rosuvastatin is passed through breast milk. The risk of myopathy may be increased in Asian Americans: ""Because Asians appear to process the drug differently, half the standard dose can have the same cholesterol-lowering benefit in those patients, though a full dose could increase the risk of side effects, a study by the drug's manufacturer, AstraZeneca, indicated."" Therefore, the lowest dose is recommended in Asians. === Myopathy === As with all statins, there is a concern of rhabdomyolysis, a severe undesired side effect. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated that ""it does not appear that the risk [of rhabdomyolysis] is greater with Crestor than with other marketed statins"", but has mandated that a warning about this side-effect, as well as a kidney toxicity warning, be added to the product label. === Diabetes mellitus === Statins increase the risk of diabetes, consistent with FDA's review, which reported a 27% increase in investigator-reported diabetes mellitus in rosuvastatin-treated people. == Drug interactions == The following drugs can have negative interactions with rosuvastatin and should be discussed with the prescribing doctor: Coumadin anticoagulants ('blood thinners', e.g. warfarin) can affect the removal of rosuvastatin Ciclosporin, colchicine Drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, e.g. cimetidine, ketoconazole, and spironolactone Additional medications for high cholesterol such as clofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and niacin (when taken in lipid-modifying doses of 1 g/day and above) Specific protease inhibitors including atazanavir (when taken with ritonavir), lopinavir/ritonavir and simeprevir Alcohol intake should be reduced while on rosuvastatin to decrease the risk of developing liver damage Aluminum and magnesium hydroxide antacids should not be taken within two hours of taking rosuvastatin Coadministration of rosuvastatin with eluxadoline may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy Grapefruit juice negatively interacts with several specific drugs in the statin class, but it has little or no effect on rosuvastatin. == Structure == Rosuvastatin has structural similarities with most other statins, e.g., atorvastatin, cerivastatin and pitavastatin, but unlike other statins, rosuvastatin contains sulfur (in sulfonyl functional group). Crestor is a calcium salt of rosuvastatin, i.e. rosuvastatin calcium, in which calcium replaces the hydrogen in the carboxylic acid group on the right of the skeletal formula at the top right of this page. == Mechanism of action == Rosuvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, having a mechanism of action similar to that of other statins. Putative beneficial effects of rosuvastatin therapy on chronic heart failure may be negated by increases in collagen turnover markers as well as a reduction in plasma coenzyme Q10 levels in patients with chronic heart failure. == Pharmacodynamics == The dose-related magnitude of rosuvastatin on blood lipids was determined in a Cochrane systematic review in 2014. Over the dose range of 1 to 80 mg/day strong linear dose‐related effects were found; total cholesterol was reduced by 22.1% to 44.8%, LDL cholesterol by 31.2% to 61.2%, non-HDL cholesterol by 28.9% to 56.7% and triglycerides by 14.4% to 26.6%. == Pharmacokinetics == Absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is about 20% and Cmax is reached in 3 to 5 hours; administration with food did not affect the AUC according to the original sponsor submitted clinical study and as per product label. However, a subsequent clinical study has shown a marked reduction in rosuvastatin exposure when administered with food. It is 88% protein bound, mainly to albumin. Fraction absorbed of rosuvastatin is frequently misquoted in the literature as approximately 0.5 (50%) due to a miscalculated hepatic extraction ratio in the original submission package subsequently corrected by the FDA reviewer. Rosuvastatin is metabolized mainly by CYP2C9 and not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% is recovered as metabolite N-desmethyl rosuvastatin. It is excreted in feces (90%) primarily and the elimination half-life is approximately 19 hours. Both AUC and Cmax are approximately 2-fold higher in Asian patients compared to Caucasian patients given the same dose of rosuvastatin. == Society and culture == Rosuvastatin is the international nonproprietary name (INN). === Economics === Because low- to moderate dose statins are strongly recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 40–75 years who are at risk, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the United States requires most health insurance plans to cover the costs of these drugs without charging the insured patient a copayment or coinsurance, even if he or she has not yet reached his or her annual deductible. Rosuvastatin 5 mg and 10 mg are examples of regimens meeting the USPSTF guideline; however, insurers have discretion as to which low- and moderate-dose statin regimens to cover under this requirement, and some only cover other statins. The drug was billed as a ""super-statin"" during its clinical development; the claim was that it offered high potency and improved cholesterol reduction compared to rivals in the class. The main competitors to rosuvastatin are atorvastatin and simvastatin. However, people can also combine ezetimibe with either simvastatin or atorvastatin and other agents on their own, for somewhat similar augmented response rates. As of 2006 some published information for comparing rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe/simvastatin results are available, but many of the relevant studies are still in progress. First launched in 2003, sales of rosuvastatin were $129 million and $908 million in 2003, and 2004, respectively, with a total patient treatment population of over 4 million by the end of 2004. Annual cost to the UK National Health Service (NHS) in 2018, for 5–40 mg rosuvastatin daily (of one person) was £24-40, compared to £10-20 for 20–80 mg simvastatin. In 2013, it was the fourth-highest-selling drug in the United States, accounting for approximately $5.2 billion in sales. In 2021, it was the thirteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 32 million prescriptions. === Legal status === Rosuvastatin is approved in the United States for the treatment of high LDL cholesterol (dyslipidemia), total cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), and/or triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia). In February 2010, rosuvastatin was approved by the FDA for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. As of 2004, rosuvastatin had been approved in 154 countries and launched in 56. Approval in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) came on 13 August 2003. === Patent protection and generic versions === The main patent that protected rosuvastatin (RE37,314, which expired in 2016) was challenged as being an improper reissue of an earlier patent. This challenge was rejected in 2010, and thus patent protection continued until 2016. In April 2016, the FDA approved the first generic version of rosuvastatin (from Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc). In July 2016, Mylan gained approval for its generic rosuvastatin calcium. === Debate and criticisms === In October 2003, several months after its introduction in Europe, Richard Horton, the editor of the medical journal The Lancet, criticized the way Crestor had been introduced. ""AstraZeneca's tactics in marketing its cholesterol-lowering drug, rosuvastatin, raise disturbing questions about how drugs enter clinical practice and what measures exist to protect patients from inadequately investigated medicines,"" according to his editorial. The Lancet's editorial position is that the data for Crestor's superiority rely too much on extrapolation from the lipid profile data (surrogate end-points) and too little on hard clinical end-points, which are available for other statins that had been on the market longer. The manufacturer responded by stating that few drugs had been tested so successfully on so many patients. In correspondence published in The Lancet, AstraZeneca's CEO Tom McKillop called the editorial ""flawed and incorrect"" and slammed the journal for making ""such an outrageous critique of a serious, well-studied medicine."" In 2004, the consumer interest organization Public Citizen filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA, asking that Crestor be withdrawn from the US market. On 11 March 2005, the FDA issued a letter to Sidney M. Wolfe of Public Citizen both denying the petition and providing an extensive detailed analysis of findings that demonstrated no basis for concerns about rosuvastatin compared with the other statins approved for marketing in the United States. In 2015, Wolfe explained why he thought that ""the drug should have been withdrawn and why it should not be used"", due to the incidence of rhabdomyolysis, renal problems, and significant increase in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting insulin levels, and decreased insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients. Rosuvastatin indeed lowered cholesterol more than other statins, but Wolfe asked ""what about actually improving health, preventing heart attacks and strokes?"" == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
515	Amiloride	WIKIPEDIA	"Amiloride, sold under the trade name Midamor among others, is a medication typically used with other medications to treat high blood pressure or swelling due to heart failure or cirrhosis of the liver. Amiloride is classified as a potassium-sparing diuretic. Amiloride is often used together with another diuretic, such as a thiazide or loop diuretic. It is taken by mouth. Onset of action is about two hours and it lasts for about a day. Common side effects include high blood potassium, vomiting, loss of appetite, rash, and headache. The risk of high blood potassium is greater in those with kidney problems, diabetes, and those who are older. Amiloride blocks the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the late distal tubule, connecting tubule, and collecting duct of the nephron, which both reduces absorption of sodium ion from the lumen of the nephron and reduces excretion of potassium ion into the lumen. Amiloride was developed in 1967. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Amiloride may be used in combination with a thiazide diuretic for treatment of high blood pressure or (less commonly) in combination with a loop diuretic for treatment of heart failure. The potassium-sparing effects of amiloride offset the low blood potassium (hypokalemia) that is often induced by thiazides or loop diuretics, which is of particular importance in people for whom maintaining a normal level of potassium is critically important. For example, people that are taking Digitalis (i.e. digoxin) are at higher risk for changes in heart rhythm if their potassium levels get too high. The 2017 clinical practice guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines list amiloride as a ""secondary"" oral antihypertensive, with minimal efficacy. For people with resistant hypertension, already taking a thiazide diuretic, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and a calcium channel blocker, the addition of amiloride (or spironolactone) was better at reducing blood pressure than adding a beta-blocker (bisoprolol) or an alpha-1 blocker (doxazosin). When combined with hydrochlorothiazide, the addition of amiloride had positive effects on blood pressure and blood sugar tolerance. Amiloride may therefore be useful for preventing the metabolic side effects of thiazide diuretics, allowing for the use of higher thiazide doses (in line with how they were originally studied). Amiloride is the treatment of choice for Liddle phenotype, which is characterized by high blood pressure, low blood potassium, and metabolic alkalosis in conjunction with a low plasma renin activity and a low aldosterone. Some people with the Liddle phenotype have Liddle syndrome, which involves a genetic mutation resulting in upregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), located in the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells in the late distal tubule and collecting duct of the kidney. Because Liddle phenotype usually involves an upregulation of ENaC channels, leading to retention of sodium and water and to hypokalemia, amiloride is useful as an ENaC channel inhibitor due to its promotion of sodium excretion and its potassium-sparing effects, restoring potassium to normal levels. Amiloride can be used as a monotherapy (single-drug therapy) or an adjunctive therapy alongside other diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) for the treatment of ascites and edema (swelling) due to cirrhosis of the liver. The 2012 clinical practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) states that amiloride can be used to treat ascites in place of spironolactone if it isn't tolerated (e.g. due to the side effect of gynecomastia), though amiloride isn't a preferred drug due to cost and lack of efficacy. === Specific populations === ==== Diabetics ==== People with diabetes are at higher risk for kidney problems, which increases their risk for hyperkalemia (high blood potassium). The use of amiloride in people with diabetes requires careful potassium and kidney function monitoring to prevent toxicity. Amiloride must be discontinued for at least 3 days prior to glucose tolerance testing, due to the risk for fatal hyperkalemia. ==== Poor kidney function ==== People with poor kidney function (e.g. blood urea nitrogen >30 mg/dL, or serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL) are at high risk for hyperkalemia. ==== Lactation ==== There is no data on the use of amiloride in women that are breastfeeding. While diuretics can make lactation difficult, it is unlikely that amiloride would induce this effect in the absence of other diuretics. ==== Pregnancy ==== Data from the use of amiloride in animals suggests that it does not pose a risk to the developing fetus. However, when used in combination with the drug acetazolamide during the process of organ formation, amiloride increases the risk for kidney and ureter abnormalities. Limited human data from use during pregnancy suggests an association with a specific congenital penis abnormality if taken during the first trimester, as well as a risk for mild intrauterine growth restriction if taken throughout pregnancy. == Contraindications == Amiloride is contraindicated in people with kidney problems (e.g. anuria, acute or chronic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy), elevated blood potassium (≥5.5 mEq/L), or people that are hypersensitive to amiloride or any ingredients within the specific formulation. Use is also contraindicated in people that are already taking potassium-sparing drugs (e.g. spironolactone and triamterene) or who are taking potassium supplements (e.g. potassium chloride) in most circumstances. == Adverse effects == Amiloride is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects of the use of amiloride include elevated blood potassium, mild skin rashes, headaches, and gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, flatulence, and abdominal pain). Mild symptoms of high blood potassium concentrations include unusual skin sensations, muscle weakness, or fatigue, but more severe symptoms such as flaccid paralysis of the limbs, slow heart rate, and even shock can occur. == Overdose == There exists no overdose data on amiloride in humans, though it is expected than an overdose would produce effects consistent with its therapeutic effects; e.g. dehydration due to over-diuresis, and electrolyte disturbances related to hyperkalemia. It is unknown if amiloride can be dialyzed off, and no specific antidote against it exists. Treatment is generally supportive, though hyperkalemia can be treated. == Interactions == Amiloride may have important drug-drug interactions when combined with other medications that also increase potassium levels in the blood, leading to hyperkalemia. For example, the combination of amiloride with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like lisinopril, or angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonists like losartan, may lead to high levels of potassium in the blood, requiring frequent monitoring. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === ==== Diuresis ==== Amiloride works by directly blocking the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with an IC50 around 0.1 μM, indicating potent blockade. Antagonism of ENaC thereby inhibits sodium reabsorption in the late distal convoluted tubules, connecting tubules, and collecting ducts in the nephron. This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, and reduces potassium excretion. The drug is often used in conjunction with a thiazide diuretic to counteract with a potassium-losing effect. Due to its potassium-sparing capacities, hyperkalemia (elevated potassium concentration in the blood) can occur. The risk of developing hyperkalemia is increased in patients who are also taking ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, other potassium-sparing diuretics, or any potassium-containing supplements. ==== Miscellaneous ==== A fraction of the effects of amiloride is inhibition of cyclic GMP-gated cation channels in the inner medullary collecting duct. Amiloride has a second action on the heart, blocking Na+/H+ exchangers such as sodium–hydrogen antiporter 1 (NHE-1). Amiloride also blocks the Na+/H+ antiporter on the apical surface of the proximal tubule cells in the nephron, abolishing more than 80% of the action of angiotensin II on the secretion of hydrogen ions in proximal tubule cells. Amiloride is not an angiotensin II receptor blocker (like losartan, for example). The Na-H transporter is also found in the Jejunum of the small intestine, as a result, amiloride also blocks the reabsorption of Na, and thereby water in the intestines. Amiloride is considered to be a reversible, pan-acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) inhibitor that prevents the transient flow of ions but not the sustained flow of ions. ASICs are members of the ENaC family of protein channels, and are found in the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal system, and the skin. Broadly, ASICs are involved in harm detection, chemosensation (pH changes specifically), and touch. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Amiloride has an oral bioavailability of 50%, meaning that about 50% of an oral dose is absorbed into the blood stream. Coadministration with food reduces the amount of amiloride that is absorbed by the body by about 30%, though it does not affect the rate of absorption. However, taking amiloride with food helps to reduce the incidence of its gastrointestinal side effects. After being taken, amiloride's diuretic effect occurs within 2 hours, with peak diuresis within 6–10 hours. The diuretic effects of amiloride persist for about 24 hours after administration. ==== Distribution ==== Amiloride cross the placenta and distributes into breast milk in vivo. ==== Metabolism ==== Amiloride is not metabolized by the liver. In comparison, the ENaC inhibitor triamterene is metabolized by the liver. ==== Excretion ==== About 50% of amiloride is excreted unchanged by the kidneys, while around 40% is excreted in the feces (likely drug that wasn't absorbed). The half-life of amiloride in humans is between 6 and 9 hours, which may be prolonged in people with poor kidney function. === Pharmacogenomics === A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the protein NEDD4L may impact how amiloride affects a person's blood pressure in cases of hypertension (high blood pressure). == Chemistry == Amiloride is a pyrazinoylguanidine, composed of a substituted pyrazine ring structure with a carbonylguanidinium substituent. Amiloride's pKa is 8.67, which is due to the guanidinium group. In high pH (alkaline, low hydrogen concentration) environments, the guanidinium group is deprotonated and the compound is rendered neutral, depleting its activity on sodium channels. Amiloride, as a pure substance, is highly fluorescent, with excitation wavelengths at 215, 288, and 360 nm, emitting light at 420 nm. == History == Amiloride was first synthesized and discovered by the Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories in the late 1960s. The drug was discovered as part of a screening process of chemicals that reversed the effects of mineralocorticoids in vivo. Amiloride was the only drug in the screen that was capable of causing the excretion of sodium (natriuresis) without a concomitant urinary excretion of potassium (kaliuresis). Thousands of amiloride analogues have been studied since its initial discovery, which have been used to study the effects of sodium transporters. Amiloride was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 5, 1981. == Society and culture == It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Amiloride is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances, as it is considered a masking agent. Diuretics like amiloride act as masking agents by reducing the concentration of other doping agents due to promoting diuresis, increasing the total volume of the urine. The list includes other potassium-sparing diuretics, such as triamterene and spironolactone. In 2008, amiloride and the potassium-sparing diuretic triamterene were found in 3% of positive diuretic doping samples. === Formulations and trade names === Amiloride hydrochloride Midamor (U.S.) Co-amilozide (amiloride hydrochloride with hydrochlorothiazide) Co-amilofruse (amiloride hydrochloride with furosemide) Amiloride hydrochloride with cyclopenthiazide Amiloride hydrochloride with bumetanide == Research == Amiloride is an inhibitor of NHE-1, which helps to maintain normal pH within cells. Cancer cells in leukemia, a type of blood cancer, have higher pH compared to normal cells. Amiloride affects the splicing and regulation of multiple genes involved in cancer, though they do not appear to be directly related to its effects on pH. Amiloride has been tested in vitro as an adjunct to the anticancer drug imatinib, which appeared to show a synergistic effect. Modified versions of amiloride, known as 5'-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), 5-N-ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (HMA), are being studied for the treatment of leukemia. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder due to a mutation in the CFTR gene, which encodes for the CFTR chloride channel. There is evidence that suggests that the molecular target of amiloride, ENaC, is also implicated in cystic fibrosis due to its effects on mucus in the lungs. Aerosolized formulations of amiloride have been tested in clinical trials, though long-term clinical trials have failed to show much utility. Due to its short duration of action, it was thought that longer-acting ENaC inhibitors may prove more effective. However, longer-acting ENaC inhibitors (i.e. benzamil) have also failed clinical trials, despite an improvement in both the solubility and potency of the drugs. A third generation amiloride analogue (N-(3,5-diamino-6-chloropyrazine-2-carbonyl)-N'-4-[4-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)phenyl]butyl-guanidine methanesulfonate, research name ""552-02""), with better pharmacokinetic properties, is being studied. Pain induced by exposure to acid is attenuated by amiloride in human trials, which may indicate a role for amiloride in the treatment of pain in the future. == References == == External links == Media related to Amiloride at Wikimedia Commons ""Amiloride"".

517	Ciprofloxacin	WIKIPEDIA	"Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections. This includes bone and joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, certain types of infectious diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, skin infections, typhoid fever, and urinary tract infections, among others. For some infections it is used in addition to other antibiotics. It can be taken by mouth, as eye drops, as ear drops, or intravenously. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe side effects include an increased risk of tendon rupture, hallucinations, and nerve damage. In people with myasthenia gravis, there is worsening muscle weakness. Rates of side effects appear to be higher than some groups of antibiotics such as cephalosporins but lower than others such as clindamycin. Studies in other animals raise concerns regarding use in pregnancy. No problems were identified, however, in the children of a small number of women who took the medication. It appears to be safe during breastfeeding. It is a second-generation fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of activity that usually results in the death of the bacteria. Ciprofloxacin was patented in 1980 and introduced by Bayer in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies ciprofloxacin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 181st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ciprofloxacin is used to treat a wide variety of infections, including infections of bones and joints, endocarditis, bacterial gastroenteritis, malignant otitis externa, bubonic plague, respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, and chancroid. Ciprofloxacin only treats bacterial infections; it does not treat viral infections such as the common cold. For certain uses including acute sinusitis, lower respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated gonorrhea, ciprofloxacin is not considered a first-line agent. Ciprofloxacin occupies an important role in treatment guidelines issued by major medical societies for the treatment of serious infections, especially those likely to be caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For example, ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole is one of several first-line antibiotic regimens recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of community-acquired abdominal infections in adults. It also features prominently in treatment guidelines for acute pyelonephritis, complicated or hospital-acquired urinary tract infection, acute or chronic prostatitis, certain types of endocarditis, certain skin infections, and prosthetic joint infections. In other cases, treatment guidelines are more restrictive, recommending in most cases that older, narrower-spectrum drugs be used as first-line therapy for less severe infections to minimize fluoroquinolone-resistance development. For example, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends the use of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in urinary tract infections be reserved to cases of proven or expected resistance to narrower-spectrum drugs such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The European Association of Urology recommends ciprofloxacin as an alternative regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, but cautions that the potential for ""adverse events have to be considered"". Although approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of respiratory infections, ciprofloxacin is not recommended for respiratory infections by most treatment guidelines due in part to its modest activity against the common respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. ""Respiratory quinolones"" such as levofloxacin, having greater activity against this pathogen, are recommended as first line agents for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in patients with important co-morbidities and in patients requiring hospitalization (Infectious Diseases Society of America 2007). Similarly, ciprofloxacin is not recommended as a first-line treatment for acute sinusitis. Ciprofloxacin is approved for the treatment of gonorrhea in many countries, but this recommendation is widely regarded as obsolete due to resistance development. === Pregnancy === An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy concluded therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data=fair), but the data are insufficient to state no risk exists. Exposure to quinolones, including levofloxacin, during the first-trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths, premature births, birth defects, or low birth weight. Two small post-marketing epidemiology studies of mostly short-term, first-trimester exposure found that fluoroquinolones did not increase risk of major malformations, spontaneous abortions, premature birth, or low birth weight. === Breastfeeding === Fluoroquinolones have been reported as present in a mother's milk and thus passed on to the nursing child. === Children === Oral and intravenous ciprofloxacin are approved by the FDA for use in children for only two indications due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system: Inhalational anthrax (postexposure) Complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli, but never as first-line agents. === Spectrum of activity === Its spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonias, bronchitis, urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis. Ciprofloxacin is particularly effective against Gram-negative bacteria (such as Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but is less effective against Gram-positive bacteria (such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) than newer fluoroquinolones. === Bacterial resistance === As a result of its widespread use to treat minor infections readily treatable with older, narrower-spectrum antibiotics, many bacteria have developed resistance to this drug, leaving it significantly less effective than it would have been otherwise. Resistance to ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during a course of treatment. Numerous pathogens, including enterococci, Streptococcus pyogenes , and Klebsiella pneumoniae (quinolone-resistant) now exhibit resistance. Widespread veterinary usage of fluoroquinolones, particularly in Europe, has been implicated. Meanwhile, some Burkholderia cepacia, Clostridium innocuum, and Enterococcus faecium strains have developed resistance to ciprofloxacin to varying degrees. Fluoroquinolones had become the class of antibiotics most commonly prescribed to adults in 2002. Nearly half (42%) of those prescriptions in the US were for conditions not approved by the FDA, such as acute bronchitis, otitis media, and acute upper respiratory tract infection. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Taking tizanidine at the same time Use by those who are hypersensitive to any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents Use by those who are diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, as muscle weakness may be exacerbated Ciprofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated in children (except for the indications outlined above), in pregnancy, to nursing mothers, and in people with epilepsy or other seizure disorders. Caution may be required in people with Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and the central nervous system. Rates of adverse effects appear to be higher than with some groups of antibiotics such as cephalosporins but lower than with others such as clindamycin. Compared to other antibiotics some studies find a higher rate of adverse effects while others find no difference. In clinical trials most of the adverse events were described as mild or moderate in severity, abated soon after the drug was discontinued, and required no treatment. Some adverse effects may be permanent. Ciprofloxacin was stopped because of an adverse event in 1% of people treated with the medication by mouth. The most frequently reported drug-related events, from trials of all formulations, all dosages, all drug-therapy durations, and for all indications, were nausea (2.5%), diarrhea (1.6%), abnormal liver function tests (1.3%), vomiting (1%), and rash (1%). Other adverse events occurred at rates of <1%. === Tendon problems === Ciprofloxacin includes a boxed warning in the United States due to an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture, especially in people who are older than 60 years, people who also use corticosteroids, and people with kidney, lung, or heart transplants. Tendon rupture can occur during therapy or even months after discontinuation of the medication. One study found that fluoroquinolone use was associated with a 1.9-fold increase in tendon problems. The risk increased to 3.2 in those over 60 years of age and to 6.2 in those over the age of 60 who were also taking corticosteroids. Among the 46,766 quinolone users in the study, 38 (0.08%) cases of Achilles tendon rupture were identified. === Cardiac arrhythmia === The fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of cardiac toxicity, including QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death. === Nervous system === Because Ciprofloxacin is lipophilic, it has the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. The 2013 FDA label warns of nervous system effects. Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold, and may cause other central nervous system adverse effects. Headache, dizziness, and insomnia have been reported as occurring fairly commonly in postapproval review articles, along with a much lower incidence of serious CNS adverse effects such as tremors, psychosis, anxiety, hallucinations, paranoia, and suicide attempts, especially at higher doses. Like other fluoroquinolones, it is also known to cause peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible, such as weakness, burning pain, tingling or numbness. Fluoroquinolones have already been reported for movement disorders. In this context, ciprofloxacin is especially associated with myoclonus, which derives the term ""ciproclonus."" === Cancer === Ciprofloxacin is active in six of eight in vitro assays used as rapid screens for the detection of genotoxic effects, but is not active in in vivo assays of genotoxicity. Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice resulted in no carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects due to ciprofloxacin at daily oral dose levels up to 250 and 750 mg/kg to rats and mice, respectively (about 1.7 and 2.5 times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m2). Results from photo co-carcinogenicity testing indicate ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV-induced skin tumors as compared to vehicle control. === Other === The other black box warning is that ciprofloxacin should not be used in people with myasthenia gravis due to possible exacerbation of muscle weakness which may lead to breathing problems resulting in death or ventilator support. Fluoroquinolones are known to block neuromuscular transmission. There are concerns that fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin can affect cartilage in young children. Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea is a serious adverse effect of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones; it is unclear whether the risk is higher than with other broad-spectrum antibiotics. A wide range of rare but potentially fatal adverse effects reported to the US FDA or the subject of case reports includes aortic dissection, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, low blood pressure, allergic pneumonitis, bone marrow suppression, hepatitis or liver failure, and sensitivity to light. The medication should be discontinued if a rash, jaundice, or other sign of hypersensitivity occurs. Children and the elderly are at a much greater risk of experiencing adverse reactions. == Overdose == Overdose of ciprofloxacin may result in reversible renal toxicity. Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach by induced vomiting or gastric lavage, as well as administration of antacids containing magnesium, aluminium, or calcium to reduce drug absorption. Renal function and urinary pH should be monitored. Important support includes adequate hydration and urine acidification if necessary to prevent crystalluria. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can only remove less than 10% of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin may be quantified in plasma or serum to monitor for drug accumulation in patients with hepatic dysfunction or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in acute overdose victims. == Interactions == Ciprofloxacin interacts with certain foods and several other drugs leading to undesirable increases or decreases in the serum levels or distribution of one or both drugs. Ciprofloxacin should not be taken with antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, highly buffered drugs (sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate, sucralfate, didanosine), or with supplements containing calcium, iron, or zinc. It should be taken two hours before or six hours after these products. Magnesium or aluminum antacids turn ciprofloxacin into insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by the intestinal tract, reducing peak serum concentrations by 90% or more, leading to therapeutic failure. Additionally, it should not be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices alone, as peak serum concentration and the area under the serum concentration-time curve can be reduced up to 40%. However, ciprofloxacin may be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices as part of a meal. Ciprofloxacin inhibits the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2 and thereby can reduce the clearance of drugs metabolized by that enzyme. CYP1A2 substrates that exhibit increased serum levels in ciprofloxacin-treated patients include tizanidine, theophylline, caffeine, methylxanthines, clozapine, olanzapine, and ropinirole. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with the CYP1A2 substrate tizanidine (Zanaflex) is contraindicated due to a 583% increase in the peak serum concentrations of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin as compared to administration of tizanidine alone. Use of ciprofloxacin is cautioned in patients on theophylline due to its narrow therapeutic index. The authors of one review recommended that patients being treated with ciprofloxacin reduce their caffeine intake. Evidence for significant interactions with several other CYP1A2 substrates such as cyclosporine is equivocal or conflicting. The Committee on Safety of Medicines and the FDA warn that central nervous system adverse effects, including seizure risk, may be increased when NSAIDs are combined with quinolones. The mechanism for this interaction may involve a synergistic increased antagonism of GABA neurotransmission. Altered serum levels of the antiepileptic drugs phenytoin and carbamazepine (increased and decreased) have been reported in patients receiving concomitant ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. == Mechanism of action == Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone class. It is active against some Gram-positive and many Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting a type II topoisomerase (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. Bacterial DNA fragmentation will occur as a result of inhibition of the enzymes. == Pharmacokinetics == Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, an oral suspension, and as a solution for intravenous administration. When administered over one hour as an intravenous infusion, ciprofloxacin rapidly distributes into the tissues, with levels in some tissues exceeding those in the serum. Penetration into the central nervous system is relatively modest, with cerebrospinal fluid levels normally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations. The serum half-life of ciprofloxacin is about 4–6 hours, with 50–70% of an administered dose being excreted in the urine as unmetabolized drug. An additional 10% is excreted in urine as metabolites. Urinary excretion is virtually complete 24 hours after administration. Dose adjustment is required in the elderly and in those with renal impairment. Ciprofloxacin is weakly bound to serum proteins (20–40%). It is an inhibitor of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 1A2, which leads to the potential for clinically important drug interactions with drugs metabolized by that enzyme. Ciprofloxacin is about 70% available when administered orally. The extended release tablets allow once-daily administration by releasing the drug more slowly in the gastrointestinal tract. These tablets contain 35% of the administered dose in an immediate-release form and 65% in a slow-release matrix. Maximum serum concentrations are achieved between 1 and 4 hours after administration. Compared to the 250- and 500-mg immediate-release tablets, the 500-mg and 1000-mg XR tablets provide higher Cmax, but the 24‑hour AUCs are equivalent. Ciprofloxacin immediate-release tablets contain ciprofloxacin as the hydrochloride salt, and the XR tablets contain a mixture of the hydrochloride salt and the free base. == Chemical properties == Ciprofloxacin is 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid. Its empirical formula is C17H18FN3O3 and its molecular weight is 331.4 g/mol. It is a faintly yellowish to light yellow crystalline substance. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (USP) is the monohydrochloride monohydrate salt of ciprofloxacin. It is a faintly yellowish to light yellow crystalline substance with a molecular weight of 385.8 g/mol. Its empirical formula is C17H18FN3O3HCl•H2O. == Usage == Ciprofloxacin is the most widely used of the second-generation quinolones. In 2010, over 20 million prescriptions were written, making it the 35th-most-commonly prescribed generic drug and the 5th-most-commonly prescribed antibacterial in the US. == History == The first members of the quinolone antibacterial class were relatively low-potency drugs such as nalidixic acid, used mainly in the treatment of urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine. In 1979, the publication of a patent filed by the pharmaceutical arm of Kyorin Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha disclosed the discovery of norfloxacin, and the demonstration that certain structural modifications including the attachment of a fluorine atom to the quinolone ring leads to dramatically enhanced antibacterial potency. In the aftermath of this disclosure, several other pharmaceutical companies initiated research and development programs with the goal of discovering additional antibacterial agents of the fluoroquinolone class. The fluoroquinolone program at Bayer focused on examining the effects of very minor changes to the norfloxacin structure. In 1983, the company published in vitro potency data for ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial having a chemical structure differing from that of norfloxacin by the presence of a single carbon atom. This small change led to a two- to 10-fold increase in potency against most strains of Gram-negative bacteria. Importantly, this structural change led to a four-fold improvement in activity against the important Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, making ciprofloxacin one of the most potent known drugs for the treatment of this intrinsically antibiotic-resistant pathogen. The oral tablet form of ciprofloxacin was approved in October 1987, just one year after the approval of norfloxacin. In 1991, the intravenous formulation was introduced. Ciprofloxacin sales reached a peak of about 2 billion euros in 2001, before Bayer's patent expired in 2004, after which annual sales have averaged around €200 million. The name probably originates from the International Scientific Nomenclature: ci- (alteration of cycl-) + propyl + fluor- + ox- + az- + -mycin. == Society and culture == === Economics === It is available as a generic medication and not very expensive. === Generic equivalents === In October 2001, the Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) project filed suit to dissolve an agreement between Bayer and three of its competitors which produced generic versions of drugs (Barr Laboratories, Rugby Laboratories, and Hoechst-Marion-Roussel) that PAL claimed was blocking access to adequate supplies and cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin. The plaintiffs charged that Bayer Corporation, a unit of Bayer AG, had unlawfully paid the three competing companies a total of $200 million to prevent cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin from being brought to the market, as well as manipulating its price and supply. Numerous other consumer advocacy groups joined the lawsuit. On 15 October 2008, five years after Bayer's patent had expired, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted Bayer's and the other defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that any anticompetitive effects caused by the settlement agreements between Bayer and its codefendants were within the exclusionary zone of the patent and thus could not be redressed by federal antitrust law, in effect upholding Bayer's agreement with its competitors. === Available forms === Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate-release tablets, as extended-release tablets, as an oral suspension, and as a solution for intravenous infusion. It is available for local administration as eye drops and ear drops. It is available in combination with dexamethasone, with celecoxib, with hydrocortisone, and with fluocinolone acetonide. === Litigation === A class action was filed against Bayer AG on behalf of employees of the Brentwood Post Office in Washington, D.C., and workers at the U.S. Capitol, along with employees of American Media, Inc. in Florida and postal workers in general who alleged they developed serious adverse effects from taking ciprofloxacin in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in 2001. The action alleged Bayer failed to warn class members of the potential side effects of the drug, thereby violating the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Laws. The class action was defeated and the litigation abandoned by the plaintiffs. A similar action was filed in 2003 in New Jersey by four New Jersey postal workers but was withdrawn for lack of grounds, as workers had been informed of the risks of ciprofloxacin when they were given the option of taking the drug. == Research == As resistance to ciprofloxacin has grown since its introduction, research has been conducted to discover and develop analogs that can be effective against resistant bacteria; some have been looked at in antiviral models as well. == References == == External links == ""Ciprofloxacin Ophthalmic"".

523	Tomatidine	WIKIPEDIA	Tomatidine is an anabolic chemical compound that prevents muscle wasting. It is naturally found in leaves of tomatoes and green tomatoes. Chemically, it is the aglycone of tomatine. It has been shown to have multiple health benefits. Tomatidine is an inhibitor of skeletal muscle atrophy, and a potential therapeutic agent for aging-associated sarcopenia, reducing weakness and atrophy in aged skeletal muscle by interaction with the ATF4 (a critical mediator of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy). Dietary supplementation with ~0.04% tomatidine for 10 weeks reduces plasma cholesterol and atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice without evidence of toxicity. == Research == It is investigated as compound to increase longevity and it increased lifespan and healthspan of C. elegans. It is also investigated in osteoporosis. == See also == Ursolic acid == References ==	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD, MEDICAL	{'FO': -0.0010681779, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -0.1690921, ' MED': -0.0002356025, 'ICAL': 0.0}
525	Hesperidin	WIKIPEDIA	"Hesperidin is a flavanone glycoside found in citrus fruits. Its aglycone is hesperetin. Its name is derived from the word ""hesperidium"", for fruit produced by citrus trees. Hesperidin was first isolated in 1828 by French chemist M. Lebreton from the white inner layer of citrus peels (mesocarp, albedo). Hesperidin is believed to play a role in plant defense. == Sources == === Rutaceae === 700–2,500 ppm in fruit of Citrus aurantium (bitter orange, petitgrain) in orange juice (Citrus sinensis) in Zanthoxylum gilletii in lemon in lime in leaves of Agathosma serratifolia === Lamiaceae === Peppermint contains hesperidin. === Content in foods === Approximate hesperidin content per 100 ml or 100 g 481 mg peppermint, dried 44 mg blood orange, pure juice 26 mg orange, pure juice 18 mg lemon, pure juice 14 mg lime, pure juice 1 mg grapefruit, pure juice == Metabolism == Hesperidin 6-O-α-L-rhamnosyl-β-D-glucosidase, an enzyme that uses hesperidin and water to produce hesperetin and rutinose, is found in the Ascomycetes species. == Research == As a flavanone found in the rinds of citrus fruits (such as oranges or lemons), hesperidin is under preliminary research for its possible biological properties in vivo. One review did not find evidence that hesperidin affected blood lipid levels or hypertension. Another review found that hesperidin may improve endothelial function in humans, but the overall results were inconclusive. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of hesperidin stems from the phenylpropanoid pathway, in which the natural amino acid L-phenylalanine undergoes a deamination by phenylalanine ammonia lyase to afford (E)-cinnamate. The resulting monocarboxylate undergoes an oxidation by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase to afford (E)-4-coumarate, which is transformed into (E)-4-coumaroyl-CoA by 4-coumarate-CoA ligase. (E)-4-coumaroyl-CoA is then subjected to the type III polyketide synthase naringenin chalcone synthase, undergoing successive condensation reactions and ultimately a ring-closing Claisen condensation to afford naringenin chalcone. The corresponding chalcone undergoes an isomerization by chalcone isomerase to afford (2S)-naringenin, which is oxidized to (2S)-eriodictyol by flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase. After O-methylation by caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, the hesperitin product undergoes a glycosylation by flavanone 7-O-glucosyltransferase to afford hesperitin-7-O-β-D-glucoside. Finally, a rhamnosyl moiety is introduced to the monoglycosylated product by 1,2-rhamnosyltransferase, forming hesperidin. == See also == Diosmin List of phytochemicals in food List of MeSH codes (D03) List of food additives == References == == External links == Media related to Hesperidin at Wikimedia Commons"	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -6.289474e-05, 'OD': 0.0}
527	4-cholesten-3-one	PUBMED	 (+)4-cholesten-3-one has been proved to have potential wound healing effect in the process of wound regeneration. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of (+)4-cholesten-3-one/sodium alginate/gelatin on skin injury and reveal its potential molecular mechanism. First, we prepared sodium alginate/gelatin hydrogel (SA/Gel hydrogel) with different ratios and tested their characteristics. Based on these results, different concentrations of (+)4-cholesten-3-one were added into SA/Gel hydrogel. A full-thickness skin injury model was successfully established to evaluate wound healing activity In this paper, we report the results of treating cells with an effective small molecule, (+)4-cholesten-3-one (PubChem CID: 91477), which can promote neural stem cell(NSC) differentiation into dopaminergic neurons. This study used rat neural stem cells stimulated with two different concentrations (7.8 μM and 78 μM) of (+)4-cholesten-3-one. Cell phenotypic analysis showed that (+)4-cholesten-3-one induced NSC differentiation into dopaminergic neurons, and the level of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH), which is specific for dopaminergic cells, was significantly increased compared with that of the drug-free control group. Furthermore, in this study, we found that this effect may be related to the transcription factor fork-head box a2 (FoxA2) and ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1). The expression of TET1 and FoxA2 was upregulated after treatment with (+)4-cholesten-3-one. To verify the relationship between (+)4-cholesten-3-one and these genes, we found that the binding rate of TET1 and FoxA2 increased after the application of (+)4-cholesten-3-one, as confirmed by a coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. With a small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiment, we found that only when Tet1 and Foxa2 were not silenced was the mRNA level of Th increased after (+)4-cholesten-3-one treatment. Taken together, these data show that (+)4-cholesten-3-one can promote the differentiation of NSCs into dopaminergic neurons by upregulating the expression of TET1 and FoxA2 and by increasing their binding. Thus, (+)4-cholesten-3-one may help address the application of neural stem cell replacement therapy in neurodegenerative diseases. Lipids are essential for energy production, signaling, and membrane formation, hence increased lipid metabolism may lead to cancer growth. 4-cholesten-3-one (4Cone), a sterol metabolite, has various biological activities, including the inhibition of cancer growth. This study examined whether 4Cone could change the lipid profile of triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and whether in combination with the anti-cancer chemotherapy docetaxel (TXT) could further reduce cancer aggressiveness. The effect of 4Cone, TXT, or their combination (4Cone/TXT) on migration and proliferation was examined utilizing the wound healing and MTT assays. The expression of the lipogenesis-related enzymes was assessed using RT-qPCR and lipid profile was examined using mass spectrometry. 4Cone and TXT individually reduced cell viability and migration of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells; however, their combination (4Cone/TXT) had a greater impact on both attributes. All treated cells showed markedly decreased levels of the multidrug resistance enzyme PGP as well as the lipogenic enzymes FASN, ACC1, SCD1, HMGCR, and DGAT. Furthermore, lipid fingerprints were markedly different in treated cells compared with the untreated group. 4Cone increased the percentage of sphingomyelin (SM) while it decreased the percentage of ceramide (Cer); 4Cone in conjunction with TXT had the reverse effect. Triglyceride levels were reduced in 4Cone- and 4Cone/TXT-treated cells, but interestingly, they increased in TXT-treated cells. Additionally, treated cancer cells exhibited changes in glycerophospholipid subclasses. 4Cone alone or in combination with TXT alters the lipid profile by reducing a key lipogenic enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration.

536	Chenodeoxycholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; also known as chenodesoxycholic acid, chenocholic acid and 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid) is a bile acid. Salts of this carboxylic acid are called chenodeoxycholates. Chenodeoxycholic acid is one of the main bile acids. It was first isolated from the bile of the domestic goose, which gives it the ""cheno"" portion of its name (Greek: χήν = goose). == Structure == Chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid are the two primary bile acids in humans. Chenodeoxycholic acid has two hydroxyl groups and is modified with the addition of another hydroxyl group to produce cholic acid. Some other mammals have muricholic acid or deoxycholic acid rather than chenodeoxycholic acid. It occurs as a white crystalline substance insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol and acetic acid, with melting point at 165–167 °C. == Biosynthesis and function == Chenodeoxycholic acid is synthesized in the liver from cholesterol via several enzymatic steps. Like other bile acids, it can be conjugated with taurine or glycine, forming taurochenodeoxycholate or glycochenodeoxycholate. Conjugation results in a lower pKa. This results in the conjugated bile acids being ionized at the usual pH in the intestine, and staying in the gastrointestinal tract until reaching the ileum to be reabsorbed. CDCA and other bile acids are surfactants forming micelles with fats, which facilitate lipid digestion. After absorption, they are taken up by the liver and resecreted, so undergoing an enterohepatic circulation. Unabsorbed CDCA can be metabolised by bacteria in the colon to form the secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid or the epimer, ursodeoxycholic acid. CDCA is the most potent natural bile acid at stimulating the nuclear bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The transcription of many genes is activated by FXR, including those encoding FGF19 and small heterodimer partner. == Therapeutic applications == === Gallstones === CDCA has been used as medical therapy to dissolve gallstones. Medical therapy with oral bile acids has been used in patients who have small cholesterol stones, and for patients with larger cholesterol gallstones who are unable or reluctant to have surgery. CDCA treatment can cause diarrhea, mild reversible hepatic injury, and a small increase in the plasma cholesterol level. === Cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis === CDCA can be used in the treatment of cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis. === Other === CDCA has been used in several other conditions. As diarrhea is frequent when CDCA is used in gallstone dissolution, it has been studied as a possible treatment for constipation and has been shown to accelerate colonic transit and improve bowel function.

537	Deoxycholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Deoxycholic acid is a bile acid. Deoxycholic acid is one of the secondary bile acids, which are metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria. The two primary bile acids secreted by the liver are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Bacteria metabolize chenodeoxycholic acid into the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid, and they metabolize cholic acid into deoxycholic acid. There are additional secondary bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid. Deoxycholic acid is soluble in alcohol and acetic acid. When pure, it exists in a white to off-white crystalline powder form. Deoxycholic acid is available as a generic medication in the United States as of April 2021, sold under the brand name Kybella among others. == Applications == Deoxycholic acid has been used since its discovery in various fields of human medicine. In the human body deoxycholic acid is used in the emulsification of fats for absorption in the intestine. It has, in some countries (including Switzerland) been licensed as an emulsifier in food industry, but it is no longer common. Outside the body it is used in experimental basis of cholagogues and is also in use to prevent and dissolve gallstones. In research deoxycholic acid is used as a mild detergent for the isolation of membrane associated proteins. The critical micelle concentration for deoxycholic acid is approximately 2.4–4 mM. Sodium deoxycholate, the sodium salt of deoxycholic acid, is often used as a biological detergent to lyse cells and solubilise cellular and membrane components. Sodium deoxycholate mixed with phosphatidylcholine, is used in mesotherapy injections to produce lipolysis, and has been used as an alternative to surgical excision in the treatment of lipomas. Deoxycholates and bile acid derivatives in general are actively being studied as structures for incorporation in nanotechnology. They also have found application in microlithography as photoresistant components. In the United States, deoxycholic acid, under the brand name Kybella, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reducing moderate-to-severe fat below the chin. When injected into submental fat, deoxycholic acid helps destroy (adipocytes) fat cells, which are metabolized by the body over the course of several months. Kybella is produced by Kythera Biopharmaceuticals. == Research in immunology == Its function as a detergent and isolating agent for membrane proteins also suits it for production of outer membrane protein (OMP) vaccines such as MenB, a Norwegian vaccine developed in the early 1990s. The MeNZB vaccine was produced using the same method. Deoxycholic acid binds and activates the membrane enzyme NAPE-PLD, which catalyzes the release of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and other N-acylethanolamines. These bioactive signaling molecules play important roles in several physiological pathways including stress and pain response, appetite, and lifespan. Some publications point towards the effect of deoxycholic acid as an immunostimulant of the innate immune system, activating its main actors, the macrophages. According to these publications, a sufficient amount of deoxycholic acid in the human body would correspond with a good immune reaction of the non-specific immune system. Clinical studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s confirm the expectation that deoxycholic acid is involved in the natural healing processes of local inflammations, different types of herpes, and possibly cancer. == Research in cancer == Deoxycholate and other secondary bile acids cause DNA damage. Secondary bile acids increase intracellular production of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species resulting in increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. As shown in the figure below, deoxycholate added to the diet of mice increased the level of 8-oxo-dG, an oxidative DNA damage, in the colonic epithelium of mice. When the level of deoxycholate-induced DNA damage is high, DNA repair enzymes that ordinarily reverse DNA damage may not be able to keep up. DNA damage has frequently been proposed as a major cause of cancer. DNA damage can give rise to cancer by causing mutations. When deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months, while none of the mice on a diet without deoxycholate developed cancer. Thus, exposure of the colon to deoxycholate may cause cancer in mice. However, this same study reported that, when chlorogenic acid was added to the diet alongside deoxycholate, only 18% of the mice developed colon cancer. Chlorogenic acid is a component of common foods and beverages; coffee contains an average of 53.8 mg chlorogenic acid per 100 ml. Therefore, to consume the level of chlorogenic acid used in the study, a human on a ""standard"" 2000-calorie daily diet (416 g/d; 250g carbs, 100g protein, 66g fat) would need to consume roughly 55 mL of coffee each day, or just under 2 fluid ounces. In humans, higher levels of colonic deoxycholate are associated with higher frequencies of colon cancer. As an example, the fecal deoxycholate concentrations in African Americans (who eat a relatively high fat diet) is more than five times higher than fecal deoxycholate of Native Africans in South Africa (who eat a low fat diet). Male African Americans have a high incidence of colon cancer of 72 per 100,000, while Native Africans in South Africa have a low incidence rate of colon cancer of less than 1 per 100,000, a more than 72-fold difference in rates of colon cancer. A prospective human study investigating the relationship between microbial metabolites and cancer found a strong correlation between circulating deoxycholic acid and colorectal cancer risk in women. == Factors affecting deoxycholate levels == A number of factors, including diet, obesity, and exercise, affect the level of deoxycholate in the human colon. When humans were switched from their usual diet to a meat, egg and cheese based diet for five days, deoxycholate in their feces increased by factors of 2 to 10 fold. Rats fed diets with 30% beef tallow (high fat) had almost 2-fold more deoxycholate in their feces than rats fed 5% beef tallow (low fat). In the same study, adding the further dietary elements of curcumin or caffeic acid to the rats' high fat (30% beef tallow) diet reduced the deoxycholate in their feces to levels comparable to levels seen in the rats on a low fat diet. Curcumin is a component of the spice turmeric, and caffeic acid is a component high in some fruits and spices. Caffeic acid is also a digestive break-down product of chlorogenic acid, high in coffee and some fruits and vegetables.In addition to fats, the type or amount of protein in the diet may also affect bile acid levels. Switching from a diet with protein provided by casein to a diet with protein provided by salmon protein hydrolysate led to as much as a 6-fold increase in levels of bile acids in the blood plasma of rats. In humans, adding high protein to a high fat diet raised the level of deoxycholate in the plasma by almost 50%. Obesity has been linked to cancer, and this link is in part through deoxycholate. In obese people, the relative proportion of Firmicutes (Gram-positive bacteria) in gut microbiota is increased resulting in greater conversion of the non-genotoxic primary bile acid, cholic acid, to carcinogenic deoxycholate. Exercise decreases deoxycholate in the colon. Humans whose level of physical activity placed them in the top third had a 17% decrease in fecal bile acid concentration compared to those whose level of physical activity placed them in the lowest third. Rats provided with an exercise wheel had a lower ratio of secondary bile acids to primary bile acids than sedentary rats in their feces. There is a positive association of exercise and physical activity with cancer prevention, tolerance to cancer-directed therapies (radiation and chemotherapy), reduction in recurrence, and improvement in survival. == References =="	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD	{'MED': -0.33731523, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.019218652, ' EN': -0.0006420229, 'DO': -1.9361265e-07, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': -3.1281633e-07, ' FOOD': -0.019583307}
545	Taurohyodeoxycholic acid	PUBMED	 Taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA), a natural 6α-hydroxylated bile acid, exhibits intestinal anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of THDCA on ulcerative colitis and to reveal its mechanisms of action. Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) to mice. Mice in the treatment group were gavage THDCA (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day) or sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg/day) or azathioprine (10 mg/kg/day). The pathologic markers of colitis were comprehensively assessed. The levels of Th1-/Th2-/Th17-/Treg-related inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors were detected by ELISA, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. The balance of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg cells was analyzed by Flow cytometry. THDCA significantly alleviated colitis by improving the body weight, colon length, spleen weight, histological characteristics, and MPO activity of colitis mice. THDCA reduced the secretion of Th1-/Th17-related cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, and TNF-α) and the expressions of transcription factors (T-bet, STAT4, RORγt, and STAT3), but increase the production of Th2-/Treg-related cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1) and the expressions of transcription factors (GATA3, STAT6, Foxp3, and Smad3) in the colon. Meanwhile, THDCA inhibited the expressions of IFN-γ, IL-17A, T-bet, and RORγt, but improved the expression of IL-4, IL-10, GATA3, and Foxp3 in the spleen. Furthermore, THDCA restored the proportion of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells, and balanced the Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg immune response of colitis mice. THDCA can alleviate TNBS-induced colitis via regulating Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance, which may represent a promising treatment for patients with colitis. The prevention of the hepatotoxic effects produced by intravenous infusion of taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) by coinfusion with taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA) was evaluated in bile fistula rats; the hepatoprotective effects of the latter were also compared with those of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). Rats infused with TCDCA at a dose of 8 micromol/min/kg showed reduced bile flow and calcium secretion, as well as increased biliary release of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This was associated with a very low biliary secretion rate of TCDCA (approximately 1 micromol/min/kg). Simultaneous infusion of THDCA or TUDCA at the same dose preserved bile flow and almost totally abolished the pathological leakage of the two enzymes into bile. The effect was slightly more potent for THDCA. The maximum secretion rate of TCDCA increased to the highest value (8 micromol/min/kg) when coinfused with either of the two hepatoprotective bile acids (BA), which were efficiently and completely secreted in the bile, without metabolism. Calcium output was also restored and phospholipid (PL) secretion increased with respect to the control saline infusion. This increase was higher in the THDCA study. These data show that THDCA is highly effective in the prevention of hepatotoxicity induced by intravenous infusion of TCDCA by facilitating its biliary secretion and reducing its hepatic residence time; this was associated with selective stimulation of PL biliary secretion. This study aimed to determine the effect in humans of taurohyodeoxycholic acid, a 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acid with hydrophilic properties, on bile lipid secretion. Four cholecystectomized patients who had gallstones and an interrupted enterohepatic circulation were intraduodenally infused with taurohyodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids on separate occasions at a dose of 0.8 to 1 g/h for 3 hours. In hourly bile samples collected for 8 hours after the beginning of the infusion, biliary bile acid composition (by high-performance liquid chromatography), biliary lipid concentrations (by standard methods), and distribution of biliary carriers (by gel chromatography) were evaluated. Blood liver function tests were performed before and after the infusions. Taurohyodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids became the predominant biliary bile acids in all patients except for one infused with taurohyodeoxycholic acid. Taurohyodeoxycholic acid stimulated significantly greater (P < .05) cholesterol and phospholipid secretion per unit of secreted bile acid (0.098 and 0.451 micromol/micromol, respectively) compared with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (0.061 micromol/micromol for cholesterol and 0.275 micromol/micromol for phospholipids). The secretory ratio between phospholipid and cholesterol was significantly higher after infusion of taurohyodeoxycholic acid (3.88 micromol/micromol) compared with taroursodeoxycholic acid (3.09 micromol/micromol) (P < .05). Biliary enrichment with taurohyodeoxycholic acid was positively related with percent concentration of phospholipids but not with that of cholesterol. The opposite trend was observed in tauroursodeoxycholic acid-enriched biles. In both taurohyodeoxycholic acid- and tauroursodeoxycholic acid-rich bile, 80% to 90% of cholesterol was carried in a gel-chromatographic fraction corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 80 to 200 kd. No alteration in liver function test results was observed after taurohyodeoxycholic acid infusion. In conclusion, taurohyodeoxycholic acid stimulates greater cholesterol and phospholipid secretion than tauroursodeoxycholic acid, but with a higher phospholipid/cholesterol secretory ratio. In bile enriched with both bile acids, biliary cholesterol is transported in non-micellar aggregates. Finally, in the conditions of our study, taurohyodeoxycholic acid was not hepatotoxic.

546	Tauroursodeoxycholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Ursodoxicoltaurine is the international nonproprietary name (INN) for the pharmaceutical form of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). It is also known as taurursodiol. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid which is the taurine conjugated form of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Humans have only trace amounts of tauroursodeoxycholic acid but bears have large amounts of tauroursodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid in their bile. == Synthesis == Bile acids are naturally synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and are conjugated with specific amino-acids, specifically taurine. Bear bile contains several bile acids including taurochenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. UDCA and its taurine conjugates comprise about 47% of the bile in American black bears and up to 76% in Asiatic bears. Ursodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid were first chemically synthesized in 1954 in Japan. Ursodeoxycholic acid is produced in several countries for the treatment of gallstones and primary biliary cholangitis. == Medical uses == In Canada and the United States, ursodoxicoltaurine, in combination with sodium phenylbutyrate, was indicated for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Following failed results from the phase 3 PHOENIX trial (NCT05021536) It has been removed from the market in April 2024. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals has announced that effective immediately Relyvrio will no longer be available. == Cellular mechanisms == Apoptosis is largely influenced by the mitochondria. If the mitochondria are distressed, they release cytochrome C (cyC) and calcium which activate caspases to propagate a cascade of cellular mechanisms to cause apoptosis. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevents apoptosis with its role in the BAX pathway. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevents BAX from being transported to the mitochondria which protects the mitochondria from perturbation and the activation of caspases. Many effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid appear to be dependent on the activation of the cell membrane receptors TGR5, S1PR2 and α5β1-Integrin. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid also acts as a chemical chaperone to help maintain the stability and correct folding of proteins. == Research == Ursodoxicoltaurine has been shown to reduce apoptosis and to have protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases and the eye, particularly for retinal degenerative disorders. Studies have shown that tauroursodeoxycholic acid has neuroprotective actions based on its potent ability to inhibit apoptosis, attenuate oxidative stress, and reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress in different experimental models of these illnesses. Studies have shown protective effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid in eye diseases. === Photoreceptor cells === A study examined the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid on cones, in relation to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease in which retinal rods and cones undergo apoptosis. Mice models were used, a wild-type and a mutant RP model, rd10. Both models were injected with tauroursodeoxycholic acid every 3 days from post-natal day 6 (p6) to p30 and compared to the vehicle. Electroretinography (ERG), photoreceptor cell counts, cone photoreceptor nuclei counts, and TUNEL labeling were all analyzed to show the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine. The dark-adapted and light-adapted ERG responses were greater in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated mouse than the vehicle treated mouse. Ursodoxicoltaurine treated mice also had more photoreceptor counts, yet non-altered retinal morphology or function. Even at P30, a stage where rod and cone function is usually greatly diminished in the rd10 mouse model, the photoreceptor function was protected. Another study, from the Department of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, saw similar effects in two components of bile, bilirubin and ursodoxicoltaurine, in relation to RP. Oxidative stress and prolonged light exposure were studied in rd10 mice and albino mice. In rd10 mice, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or ursodoxicoltaurine were given every 3 days starting at P6. This caused a considerable preservation in cone cell amount and function at P50, and a modest rod cell amount at P30. In the albino mice models, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or ursodoxicoltaurine were given prior to prolonged light exposure. Both treatments had positive effects on the health of the mouse retina, including a reduced accumulation of superoxide radicals, rod cell death, and disruption of cone inner and outer segments. The findings of the study are elucidating optimized conditions for RP treatment. === Choroidal neovascularization === A study done at the Department of Ophthalmology at Seoul National University College of Medicine examined the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA on laser-treated choroids of rat models. Argon lasers were used to induce choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rat models. Ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA were injected intraperitoneally 24 hours before and daily after the laser treatment. Fourteen days after laser-treatment, the eyes were examined for effects. Fluorescein angiography showed lower leakage from the CNV in UDCA and ursodoxicoltaurine treated groups than the control group. Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the retina were examined and showed lower levels in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated group compared to the control group, whereas no effect in the UDCA treated group. ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA may suppress CNV formation, which may be associated with its anti-inflammatory effects. === Synaptic connectivity === A study from the Department of Physiology in University of Alicante, in Alicante, Spain, shows the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine in the P23H transgenic rat, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The transgenic rats were injected with ursodoxicoltaurine once a week starting from P21 until P120, along with vehicle-administered controls. At P120, the functionality of the retina was examined via ERG and immunoflourescent microscopy. The amplitude of the a- and b- waves were considerably higher in ursodoxicoltaurine treated rats, compared to the control group. Photoreceptor density in the center of the retina was three-fold greater in ursodoxicoltaurine treated rats. Also, TUNEL results showed smaller amounts of TUNEL-positive cells. The synaptic contacts amongst photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells were preserved in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated P23H rats. Additionally, the synaptic terminals in the outer plexiform layer were of greater density that in control rats. The neuroprotective effects of ursodoxicoltaurine are not only preserving retinal morphology and function, but also its synaptic contacts, a potentially useful aspect in delaying RP. === Other diseases === Tauroursodeoxycholic acid has also been suggested to have potential application in heart disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke in view of the drug's ability to reduce apoptotic effects. == References ==	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.000104377614, 'ICAL': 0.0}
548	Taurocholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Taurocholic acid, known also as cholaic acid, cholyltaurine, or acidum cholatauricum, is a deliquescent yellowish crystalline bile acid involved in the emulsification of fats. It occurs as a sodium salt in the bile of mammals. It is a conjugate of cholic acid with taurine. In medical use, it is administered as a cholagogue and choleretic. Hydrolysis of taurocholic acid yields taurine. For commercial use, taurocholic acid is manufactured from cattle bile, a byproduct of the meat-processing industry.

552	Glycoursodeoxycholic acid	PUBMED	 Accumulating evidence suggests that the bile acid regulates type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through gut microbiota-host interactions. However, the mechanisms underlying such interactions have been unclear. Here, we found that glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) positively regulates gut microbiota by altering bile acid metabolism. GUDCA in mice resulted in higher taurolithocholic acid (TLCA) level and  Glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) has been acknowledged for its ability to regulate lipid homeostasis and provide benefits for various metabolic disorders. However, the impact of GUDCA on arterial thrombotic events remains unexplored. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of GUDCA on thrombogenesis and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Plasma samples from patients with arterial thrombotic events and diet-induced obese mice were collected to determine the GUDCA concentrations using mass spectrometry. Multiple in vivo murine thrombosis models and in vitro platelet functional assays were conducted to comprehensively evaluate the antithrombotic effects of GUDCA. Moreover, lipidomic analysis was performed to identify the alterations of intraplatelet lipid components following GUDCA treatment. Plasma GUDCA level was significantly decreased in patients with arterial thrombotic events and negatively correlated with thrombotic propensity in diet-induced obese mice. GUDCA exhibited prominent suppressing effects on platelet reactivity as evidenced by the attenuation of platelet activation, secretion, aggregation, spreading, and retraction ( Our study implicated that GUDCA reduces platelet hyperreactivity and improves thrombotic propensity by inhibiting DGKs activity, which is a potentially effective prophylactic approach and promising therapeutic agent for arterial thrombotic events. Background Although glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) has been associated with the improvement of metabolic disorders, its effect on atherosclerosis remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the role of GUDCA in the development of atherosclerosis and its potential mechanisms. Methods and Results Human THP-1 macrophages were used to investigate the effect of GUDCA on oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation in vitro. We found that GUDCA downregulated scavenger receptor A1 mRNA expression, reduced oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake, and inhibited macrophage foam cell formation. In an in vivo study, apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were fed a Western diet for 10 weeks to induce atherosclerosis, and then were gavaged once daily with or without GUDCA for 18 weeks. Parameters of systemic metabolism and atherosclerosis were detected. We found that GUDCA improved cholesterol homeostasis and protected against atherosclerosis progression as evidenced by reduced plaque area along with lipid deposition, ameliorated local chronic inflammation, and elevated plaque stability. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing showed that GUDCA administration partially normalized the Western diet-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis.

564	Diosgenin	WIKIPEDIA	Diosgenin, a phytosteroid sapogenin, is the product of hydrolysis by acids, strong bases, or enzymes of saponins, extracted from the tubers of Dioscorea wild yam species, such as the Kokoro. It is also present in smaller amounts in a number of other species. The sugar-free (aglycone) product of such hydrolysis, diosgenin is used for the commercial synthesis of cortisone, pregnenolone, progesterone, and other steroid products. == Sources == It is present in detectable amounts in Costus speciosus, Smilax menispermoidea, Helicteres isora, species of Paris, Aletris, Trigonella, and Trillium, and in extractable amounts from many species of Dioscorea – D. althaeoides, D. colletti, D. composita, D. floribunda, D. futschauensis, D. gracillima, D. hispida, D. hypoglauca, D. mexicana, D. nipponica, D. panthaica, D. parviflora, D. septemloba, and D. zingiberensis. == Industrial uses == Diosgenin is a chemical precursor for several hormones, starting with the Marker degradation process, which includes synthesis of progesterone. The process was used in the early manufacturing of combined oral contraceptive pills. Diosgenin in dietary supplements is not a physiological precursor to estradiol or progesterone, and the use of such products as wild yam has no hormonal activity in the human body. == See also == List of neurosteroids Spirostanes == References == == External links == Diosgenin at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL	{'MED': -0.0030650569, 'ICAL': -3.1281633e-07, ',': -2.6968896e-06, ' IND': -0.41641888, 'UST': -1.9361265e-07, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0}
570	Ent-kaurane	PUBMED	 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction is an effective mechanism to kill cancer cells for many chemotherapeutics, while resettled redox homeostasis induced by the anticancer drugs will promote cancer chemoresistance. Natural ent-kaurane diterpenoids have been found to bind glutathione (GSH) and sulfhydryl group in antioxidant enzymes covalently, which leads to the destruction of intracellular redox homeostasis. Therefore, redox resetting destruction by ent-kaurane diterpenoids may emerge as a viable strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, we isolated 30 ent-kaurane diterpenoids including 20 new samples from Chinese liverworts Jungermannia tetragona Lindenb and studied their specific targets and possible application in cancer drug resistance through redox resetting destruction. 11β-hydroxy-ent-16-kaurene-15-one (23) possessed strong inhibitory activity against several cancer cell lines. Moreover, compound 23 induced both apoptosis and ferroptosis through increasing cellular ROS levels in HepG2 cells. ROS accumulation induced by compound 23 was caused by inhibition of antioxidant systems through targeting peroxiredoxin I/II (Prdx I/II) and depletion of GSH. Furthermore, compound 23 sensitized cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant A549/CDDP cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis and ferroptosis. Thus, the ent-kaurane derivative showed potential application for sensitizing CDDP resistance by redox resetting destruction through dual inhibition of Prdx I/II and GSH in cancer chemotherapy.

571	Oleanolic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Oleanolic acid or oleanic acid is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid related to betulinic acid. It is widely distributed in food and plants where it exists as a free acid or as an aglycone of triterpenoid saponins. == Natural occurrence == Oleanolic acid can be found in olive oil, Phytolacca americana (American pokeweed), and Syzygium spp, garlic, etc. It was first studied and isolated from several plants, including Olea europaea (leaves, fruit), Rosa woodsii (leaves), Prosopis glandulosa (leaves and twigs), Phoradendron juniperinum (whole plant), Syzygium claviflorum (leaves), Hyptis capitata (whole plant), Mirabilis jalapa and Ternstroemia gymnanthera (aerial part). Other Syzygium species including java apple (Syzygium samarangense) and rose apples contain it, as does Ocimum tenuiflorum (holy basil). == Biosynthesis of oleanolic acids == Oleanolic acid biosynthesis starts with mevalonate to create squalene. Squalene monooxygenase in the next step oxidases the squalene and forms an epoxide resulting in 2,3-oxidosqualene. Beta-amyrin synthase creates beta-amyrin by a ring formation cascade. After the formation of beta amyrin, CYP716AATR2, also known as a cytochrome p450 enzyme, oxidizes carbon 28 turning it into alcohol. CYP716AATR2 converts the alcohol to aldehyde and finally to a carboxylic acid forming oleanolic acid. == Pharmacological research == Oleanolic acid is relatively non-toxic, hepatoprotective, and exhibits antitumor and antiviral properties. Oleanolic acid was found to exhibit weak anti-HIV and weak anti-HCV activities in vitro, but more potent synthetic analogs are being investigated as potential drugs. An extremely potent synthetic triterpenoid analog of oleanolic acid was found in 2005, that is a powerful inhibitor of cellular inflammatory processes. They work by the induction by IFN-γ of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and of cyclooxygenase 2 in mouse macrophages. They are extremely potent inducers of the phase 2 response (e.g., elevation of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase and heme oxygenase 1), which is a major protector of cells against oxidative and electrophile stress. A 2002 study in Wistar rats found that oleanolic acid reduced sperm quality and motility, causing infertility. After withdrawing exposure, male rats regained fertility and successfully impregnated female rats. Oleanolic acid is also used as standard for comparison of hyaluronidase, elastase and matrix-metalloproteinase-1 inhibition of other substances in primary research (similar to diclofenac sodium for comparison of analgesic activity). Oleanolic acid activates telomerase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 5.9-fold, more than any other compounded tested, with the exception of Centella asiatica (8.8-fold). Less telomerase activation is seen for Astragalus extract 4.3-fold, TA-65 2.2-fold, and maslinic acid 2-fold. == See also == Ursolic acid Betulinic acid Moronic acid Momordin (saponin), a glycoside of oleanolic acid List of phytochemicals in food == References ==	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	{'FO': -0.016503377, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -1.867018e-05, ' PERSON': -0.17622781, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}
574	Hydroxyzine	WIKIPEDIA	"Hydroxyzine, sold under the brand names Atarax and Vistaril among others, is an antihistamine medication. It is used in the treatment of itchiness, anxiety, insomnia, and nausea (including that due to motion sickness). It is used either by mouth or injection into a muscle. Hydroxyzine works by blocking the effects of histamine. It is a first-generation antihistamine in the piperazine family of chemicals. Common side effects include sleepiness, headache, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include QT prolongation. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. It was first made by Union Chimique Belge in 1956 and was approved for sale by Pfizer in the United States later that year. In 2022, it was the 46th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Hydroxyzine is used in the treatment of itchiness, anxiety, and nausea due to motion sickness. A systematic review concluded that hydroxyzine outperforms placebo in treating generalized anxiety disorder. Insufficient data were available to compare the drug with benzodiazepines and buspirone. Hydroxyzine can also be used for the treatment of allergic conditions, such as chronic urticaria, atopic or contact dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus. These have also been confirmed in both recent and past studies to have no adverse effects on the liver, blood, nervous system, or urinary tract. Use of hydroxyzine for premedication as a sedative has no effects on tropane alkaloids, such as atropine, but may, following general anesthesia, potentiate meperidine and barbiturates, and use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified depending upon the state of the individual. Doses of hydroxyzine hydrochloride used for sleep range from 25 to 100 mg. As with other antihistamine sleep aids, hydroxyzine is usually only prescribed for short term or ""as-needed"" use since tolerance to the CNS (central nervous system) effects of hydroxyzine can develop in as little as a few days. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of hydroxyzine for insomnia. A 2023 meta-review concludes that hydroxyzine is effective for inducing sleep onset but less effective for maintaining sleep for eight hours. == Contraindications == Hydroxyzine is contraindicated for subcutaneous or intra-articular administration. The administration of hydroxyzine in large amounts by ingestion or intramuscular administration during the onset of pregnancy can cause fetal abnormalities. When administered to pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits, hydroxyzine caused abnormalities such as hypogonadism with doses significantly above that of the human therapeutic range. In humans, a significant dose has not yet been established in studies, and, by default, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has introduced contraindication guidelines regarding hydroxyzine. Use by those at risk for or showing previous signs of hypersensitivity is also contraindicated. Other contraindications include the administration of hydroxyzine alongside depressants and other compounds that affect the central nervous system; if necessary, it should only be administered concomitantly in small doses. If administered in small doses with other substances, as mentioned, then patients should refrain from using dangerous machinery, motor vehicles, or any other practice requiring absolute concentration, under safety laws. Studies have also been conducted which show that long-term prescription of hydroxyzine can lead to tardive dyskinesia after years of use, but effects related to dyskinesia have also anecdotally been reported after periods of 7.5 months, such as continual head rolling, lip licking, and other forms of athetoid movement. In certain cases, elderly patients' previous interactions with phenothiazine derivatives or pre-existing neuroleptic treatment may have contributed to dyskinesia at the administration of hydroxyzine due to hypersensitivity caused by prolonged treatment, and therefore some contraindication is given for short-term administration of hydroxyzine to those with previous phenothiazine use. == Side effects == Several reactions have been noted in manufacturer guidelines—deep sleep, incoordination, sedation, calmness, and dizziness have been reported in children and adults, as well as others such as hypotension, tinnitus, and headaches. Gastrointestinal effects have also been observed, as well as less serious effects such as dryness of the mouth and constipation caused by the mild antimuscarinic properties of hydroxyzine. Central nervous system effects such as hallucinations or confusion have been observed in rare cases, attributed mostly to overdosage. Such properties have been attributed to hydroxyzine in several cases, particularly in patients treated for neuropsychological disorders, as well as in cases where overdoses have been observed. While there are reports of the ""hallucinogenic"" or ""hypnotic"" properties of hydroxyzine, several clinical data trials have not reported such side effects from the sole consumption of hydroxyzine, but rather, have described its overall calming effect described through the stimulation of areas within the reticular formation. The hallucinogenic or hypnotic properties have been described as being an additional effect from overall central nervous system suppression by other CNS agents, such as lithium or ethanol. Hydroxyzine exhibits anxiolytic and sedative properties in many psychiatric patients. One study showed that patients reported very high levels of subjective sedation when first taking the drug, but that levels of reported sedation decreased markedly over 5–7 days, likely due to CNS receptor desensitization. Other studies have suggested that hydroxyzine acts as an acute hypnotic, reducing sleep onset latency and increasing sleep duration — also showing that some drowsiness did occur. This was observed more in female patients, who also had greater hypnotic responses. The use of sedating drugs alongside hydroxyzine can cause oversedation and confusion if administered at high doses—any form of hydroxyzine treatment alongside sedatives should be done under the supervision of a doctor. Because of the potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid in the elderly. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Hydroxyzine's predominant mechanism of action is as a potent and selective histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. This action is responsible for its antihistamine and sedative effects. Unlike many other first-generation antihistamines, hydroxyzine has a lower affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and in accordance, has a lower risk of anticholinergic side effects. In addition to its antihistamine activity, hydroxyzine has also been shown to act more weakly as an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the dopamine D2 receptor, and the α1-adrenergic receptor. Similarly to the atypical antipsychotics, the comparably weak antiserotonergic effects of hydroxyzine likely underlie its usefulness as an anxiolytic. Other antihistamines without such properties have not been found to be effective in the treatment of anxiety. Hydroxyzine crosses the blood–brain barrier easily and exerts effects in the central nervous system. A positron emission tomography (PET) study found that brain occupancy of the H1 receptor was 67.6% for a single 30 mg dose of hydroxyzine. In addition, subjective sleepiness correlated well with the brain H1 receptor occupancy. PET studies with antihistamines have found that brain H1 receptor occupancy of more than 50% is associated with a high prevalence of somnolence and cognitive decline, whereas brain H1 receptor occupancy of less than 20% is considered to be non-sedative. Hydroxyzine also acts as a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase. === Pharmacokinetics === Hydroxyzine can be administered orally or via intramuscular injection. When given orally, hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed and distributed with oral and intramuscular administration, and is metabolized in the liver; the main metabolite (45%), cetirizine, is formed through oxidation of the alcohol moiety to a carboxylic acid by alcohol dehydrogenase, and overall effects are observed within one hour of administration. Higher concentrations are found in the skin than in the plasma. Cetirizine, although less sedating, is non-dialyzable and possesses similar antihistamine properties. The other metabolites identified include a N-dealkylated metabolite, and an O-dealkylated 1/16 metabolite with a plasma half-life of 59 hours. These pathways are mediated principally by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The N-dealykylated metabolite, norchlorcyclizine, bears some structural similarities to trazodone, but it has not been established whether it is pharmacologically active. In animals, hydroxyzine and its metabolites are excreted in feces primarily through biliary elimination. In rats, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged. The time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) of hydroxyzine is about 2.0 hours in both adults and children and its elimination half-life is around 20.0 hours in adults (mean age 29.3 years) and 7.1 hours in children. Its elimination half-life is shorter in children compared to adults. In another study, the elimination half-life of hydroxyzine in elderly adults was 29.3 hours. One study found that the elimination half-life of hydroxyzine in adults was as short as 3 hours, but this may have just been due to methodological limitations. Although hydroxyzine has a long elimination half-life and acts, in-vivo, as an antihistamine for as long as 24 hours, the predominant CNS effects of hydroxyzine and other antihistamines with long half-lives seem to diminish after 8 hours. Administration in geriatrics differs from the administration of hydroxyzine in younger patients; according to the FDA, there have not been significant studies made (2004), which include population groups over 65, which provide a distinction between elderly aged patients and other younger groups. Hydroxyzine should be administered carefully in the elderly with consideration given to possible reduced elimination. == Chemistry == Hydroxyzine is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine class of antihistamines. Hydroxyzine is supplied mainly as a dihydrochloride salt (hydroxyzine hydrochloride) but also to a lesser extent as an embonate salt (hydroxyzine pamoate). The molecular weights of hydroxyzine, hydroxyzine dihydrochloride, and hydroxyzine pamoate are 374.9 g/mol, 447.8 g/mol, and 763.3 g/mol, respectively. Due to their differences in molecular weight, 1 mg hydroxyzine dihydrochloride is equivalent to about 1.7 mg hydroxyzine pamoate. === Analogues === Analogues of hydroxyzine include buclizine, cetirizine, cinnarizine, cyclizine, etodroxizine, meclizine, and pipoxizine among others. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Hydroxyzine preparations require a doctor's prescription. The drug is available in two formulations, the pamoate and the dihydrochloride or hydrochloride salts. Vistaril, Equipose, Masmoran, and Paxistil are preparations of the pamoate salt, while Atarax, Alamon, Aterax, Durrax, Tran-Q, Orgatrax, Quiess, and Tranquizine are of the hydrochloride salt. == See also == Gabasync == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
575	Famotidine	WIKIPEDIA	Famotidine, sold under the brand name Pepcid among others, is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist medication that decreases stomach acid production. It is used to treat peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. It begins working within an hour. Common side effects include headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include pneumonia and seizures. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied, while use during breastfeeding is not recommended. Famotidine was patented in 1979 and came into medical use in 1985. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 49th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Heartburn, acid indigestion, and sour stomach Treatment for gastric and duodenal ulcers Treatment for pathologic gastrointestinal hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger–Ellison syndrome and multiple endocrine adenomas Treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Treatment for esophagitis Part of a multidrug regimen for Helicobacter pylori eradication, although omeprazole may be somewhat more effective. Prevention of NSAID-induced peptic ulcers. Given to surgery patients before operations to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia. == Pharmacokinetics == Famotidine has a delayed onset of action, beginning after 90 minutes. However, famotidine has a duration of effect of at least 540 minutes (9.0 h). At its peak effect, 210 minutes (3.5 h) after administration, famotidine reduces acid secretion by 7.3 mmol per 30 minutes. == Side effects == The most common side effects associated with famotidine use include headache, dizziness, and constipation or diarrhea. Famotidine may contribute to QT prolongation, particularly when used with other QT-elongating drugs, or in people with poor kidney function. == Mechanism of action == Activation of H2 receptors located on parietal cells stimulates proton pumps to secrete acid into the stomach lumen. Famotidine, an H2 antagonist, blocks the action of histamine on the parietal cells, ultimately reducing acid secretion into the stomach. == Interactions == Unlike cimetidine, the first H2 antagonist, famotidine has a minimal effect on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and does not appear to interact with as many drugs as other medications in its class. Some exceptions include antiretrovirals such as atazanavir, chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin, and antifungal medications such as itraconazole. == History == Famotidine was developed by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. It was licensed in the mid-1980s by Merck & Co. and is marketed by a joint venture between Merck and Johnson & Johnson. The imidazole ring of cimetidine was replaced with a 2-guanidinothiazole ring. Famotidine proved to be nine times more potent than ranitidine, and thirty-two times more potent than cimetidine. It was first marketed in 1981. Pepcid RPD orally disintegrating tablets were released in 1999. Generic preparations became available in 2001, e.g. Fluxid (Schwarz) or Quamatel (Gedeon Richter Ltd.). In the United States and Canada, a product called Pepcid Complete, which combines famotidine with an antacid in a chewable tablet to relieve the symptoms of excess stomach acid quickly, is available. In the UK, this product was known as PepcidTwo until its discontinuation in April 2015. Famotidine has poor bioavailibility (50%) due to its low solubility in the high pH of the intestines. Researchers are developing formulations that use gastroretentive drug delivery systems such as floating tablets to increase bioavailability by promoting local delivery (directly into the stomach wall) of these drugs to receptors in the parietal cell membrane. == Society and culture == Certain preparations of famotidine are available over-the-counter (OTC) in various countries. In the United States and Canada, 10 mg and 20 mg tablets, sometimes in combination with an antacid, are available OTC. Larger doses still require a prescription. Formulations of famotidine in combination with ibuprofen were marketed by Horizon Pharma under the trade name Duexis. == Research == === COVID-19 === At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, some doctors observed that anecdotally some hospitalized patients in China may have had better outcomes on famotidine than other patients who were not taking famotidine. This led to hypotheses about use of famotidine in treatment of COVID-19. Famotidine was considered a possible treatment for COVID-19 due to its potential anti-inflammatory effects. It was thought that famotidine could modify lung inflammation caused by coronaviruses. However, studies have shown that famotidine is not effective in reducing mortality or improving recovery in COVID-19 patients. Famotidine primarily works by blocking the effects of histamine and has some potential mechanisms of action that may contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties, including the inhibition of the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6. Another hypothesis was that famotidine might activate the vagus nerve inflammatory reflex to attenuate cytokine storm. Yet another hypothesis was that famotidine can reduce the activation of mast cells and the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators, therefore acting as a mast cell stabilizer. However, while famotidine may have some anti-inflammatory effects, there is currently insufficient evidence to support its use for treating inflammation associated with COVID-19. Therefore, it is not recommended for this purpose. === Other === Small-scale studies have shown inconsistent and inconclusive evidence of efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. == Veterinary uses == Famotidine is given to dogs and cats with acid reflux. == References == == External links == Media related to Famotidine at Wikimedia Commons	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
579	Nonaethylene glycol	PUBMED	 Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood malignancy originating from the sympathetic nervous system, and accounts for approximately 15% of all pediatric cancer-related deaths. As the 5-y survival rate of patients with high-risk NB is <50%, novel therapeutic strategies for NB patients are urgently required. Nonaethylene glycol mono('4-iodo-4-biphenyl)ester (9bw) is a polyethylene glycol derivative, synthesized by modifying a compound originally extracted from filamentous bacteria. Although 9bw shows remarkable inhibition of tumor cell growth, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined the efficacy of 9bw on human NB-derived cells, and investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of 9bw on these cells. Our results indicated that 9bw induced cell death in NB cells by decreasing the production of ATP. Metabolome analysis and measurement of oxygen consumption indicated that 9bw markedly suppressed oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Further analyses indicated that 9bw inhibited the activity of mitochondrial respiratory complex I. Moreover, we showed that 9bw inhibited growth of NB in vivo. Based on the results of the present study, 9bw is a good candidate as a novel agent for treatment of NB.	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.13235784, 'ICAL': 0.0}
580	Adipic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Adipic acid or hexanedioic acid is the organic compound with the formula (CH2)4(COOH)2. From an industrial perspective, it is the most important dicarboxylic acid: about 2.5 billion kilograms of this white crystalline powder are produced annually, mainly as a precursor for the production of nylon. Adipic acid otherwise rarely occurs in nature, but it is known as manufactured E number food additive E355. Salts and esters of adipic acid are known as adipates. == Preparation and reactivity == Adipic acid is produced by oxidation of a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, which is called KA oil, an abbreviation of ketone-alcohol oil. Nitric acid is the oxidant. The pathway is multistep. Early in the reaction, the cyclohexanol is converted to the ketone, releasing nitrous acid: HOCH(CH2)5 + HNO3 → O=C(CH2)5 + HNO2 + H2O The cyclohexanone is then nitrosated, setting the stage for the scission of the C-C bond: HNO2 + HNO3 → [NO+]NO3]− + H2O O=C(CH2)5 + NO+ → O=C(CHNO)(CH2)4 + H+ Side products of the method include glutaric and succinic acids. Nitrous oxide is produced in about one to one mole ratio to the adipic acid, as well, via the intermediacy of a nitrolic acid. Related processes start from cyclohexanol, which is obtained from the hydrogenation of phenol. === Alternative methods of production === Several methods have been developed by carbonylation of butadiene. For example, the hydrocarboxylation proceeds as follows: CH2=CH−CH=CH2 + 2 CO + 2 H2O → HO2C(CH2)4CO2H Another method is oxidative cleavage of cyclohexene using hydrogen peroxide. The waste product is water. Auguste Laurent discovered adipic acid in 1837 by oxidation of various fats with nitric acid via sebacic acid and gave it the current name because of that (ultimately from Latin adeps, adipis – ""animal fat""; cf. adipose tissue). === Reactions === Adipic acid is a dibasic acid (it has two acidic groups). The pKa values for their successive deprotonations are 4.41 and 5.41. With the carboxylate groups separated by four methylene groups, adipic acid is suited for intramolecular condensation reactions. Upon treatment with barium hydroxide at elevated temperatures, it undergoes ketonization to give cyclopentanone. == Uses == About 60% of the 2.5 billion kg of adipic acid produced annually is used as monomer for the production of nylon by a polycondensation reaction with hexamethylene diamine forming nylon 66. Other major applications also involve polymers; it is a monomer for production of polyurethane and its esters are plasticizers, especially in PVC. === In medicine === Adipic acid has been incorporated into controlled-release formulation matrix tablets to obtain pH-independent release for both weakly basic and weakly acidic drugs. It has also been incorporated into the polymeric coating of hydrophilic monolithic systems to modulate the intragel pH, resulting in zero-order release of a hydrophilic drug. The disintegration at intestinal pH of the enteric polymer shellac has been reported to improve when adipic acid was used as a pore-forming agent without affecting release in the acidic media. Other controlled-release formulations have included adipic acid with the intention of obtaining a late-burst release profile. === In foods === Small but significant amounts of adipic acid are used as a food ingredient as a flavorant and gelling aid. It is used in some calcium carbonate antacids to make them tart. As an acidulant in baking powders, it avoids the undesirable hygroscopic properties of tartaric acid. Adipic acid, rare in nature, does occur naturally in beets, but this is not an economical source for commerce compared to industrial synthesis. == Safety == Adipic acid, like most carboxylic acids, is a mild skin irritant. It is mildly toxic, with a median lethal dose of 3600 mg/kg for oral ingestion by rats. == Environmental == The production of adipic acid is linked to emissions of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas and cause of stratospheric ozone depletion. At adipic acid producers DuPont and Rhodia (now Invista and Solvay, respectively), processes have been implemented to catalytically convert the nitrous oxide to innocuous products: 2 N2O → 2 N2 + O2 == Adipate salts and esters == The anionic (HO2C(CH2)4CO2−) and dianionic (−O2C(CH2)4CO2−) forms of adipic acid are referred to as adipates. An adipate compound is a carboxylate salt or ester of the acid. Some adipate salts are used as acidity regulators, including: Sodium adipate (E number E356) Potassium adipate (E357) Some adipate esters are used as plasticizers, including: Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate Dioctyl adipate Dimethyl adipate == References == == Appendix == U.S. FDA citations – GRAS (21 CFR 184.1009), Indirect additive (21 CFR 175.300, 21 CFR 175.320, 21 CFR 176.170, 21 CFR 176.180, 21 CFR 177.1200, 21 CFR 177.1390, 21 CFR 177.1500, 21 CFR 177.1630, 21 CFR 177.1680, 21 CFR 177.2420, 21 CFR 177.2600) European Union Citations – Decision 1999/217/EC – Flavoing Substance; Directive 95/2/EC, Annex IV – Permitted Food Additive; 2002/72/EC, Annex A – Authorized monomer for Food Contact Plastics == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0369 SIDS Initial Assessment Report for Adipic acid from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) adipic acid on chemicalland"	FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL	INDUSTRIAL, FOOD	{'IND': -0.44799802, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0, ',': -1.9361265e-07, ' FOOD': -0.0011264061}
581	Citrulline	WIKIPEDIA	The organic compound citrulline is an α-amino acid. Its name is derived from citrullus, the Latin word for watermelon. Although named and described by gastroenterologists since the late 19th century, it was first isolated from watermelon in 1914 by Japanese researchers Yatarō Koga (古賀彌太郎) and Ryō Ōtake (大嶽了) and further codified by Mitsunori Wada of Tokyo Imperial University in 1930. It has the formula H2NC(O)NH(CH2)3CH(NH2)CO2H. It is a key intermediate in the urea cycle, the pathway by which mammals excrete ammonia by converting it into urea. Citrulline is also produced as a byproduct of the enzymatic production of nitric oxide from the amino acid arginine, catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase. == Biosynthesis == Citrulline can be derived from: from arginine via nitric oxide synthase, as a byproduct of the production of nitric oxide for signaling purposes from ornithine through the breakdown of proline or glutamine/glutamate from asymmetric dimethylarginine via DDAH Citrulline is made from ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate in one of the central reactions in the urea cycle. It is also produced from arginine as a byproduct of the reaction catalyzed by NOS family (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39). It is also prevalent in trichohyalin at the inner root sheath and medulla of hair follicles, where it is synthesized from arginine. Arginine is first oxidized into N-hydroxyl-arginine, which is then further oxidized to citrulline concomitant with release of nitric oxide. Citrulline is also made by enterocytes of the small intestine. == Function == Citrulline is a metabolic intermediate within the urea cycle, which is the pathway by which mammals excrete ammonia by converting it into urea. Citrulline is also produced as a byproduct of the enzymatic production of nitric oxide from the amino acid arginine, catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase. In the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, citrulline is a metabolic intermediate in the latter, cytosolic half of the arginine biosynthesis pathway. Several proteins contain citrulline as a result of a post-translational modification. These citrulline residues are generated by a family of enzymes called peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), which convert arginine into citrulline in a process called citrullination or deimination with the help of calcium ions. Proteins that normally contain citrulline residues include myelin basic protein (MBP), filaggrin, and several histone proteins, whereas other proteins, such as fibrin and vimentin are susceptible to citrullination during cell death and tissue inflammation. Circulating citrulline concentration is a biomarker of intestinal functionality. == Commercial use == L-citrulline is sold as a dietary supplement, usually in powder form. Advocates suggest that since L-citrulline boosts nitric oxide production, helping arterial function and thus blood flow throughout the body, this might be helpful in treating or preventing various ailments. Lowering blood pressure in people with elevated blood pressure. Easing symptoms of mild-to-moderate erectile dysfunction, with fewer risks than Viagra. Ameliorating circulatory problems such as slow wound healing due to diabetes. Raising muscle protein levels, preventing malnourishment in the elderly and possibly improving athletic performance. Treating intestinal problems, including short bowel syndrome, celiac disease and radiation-caused small bowel damage Various genetic disorders and health conditions such as liver disease, Parkinson's disease and certain dementias. These assertions are based on animal studies, and like most dietary supplement claims have not be endorsed by the Food and Drugs Administration. L-citrulline is added to certain energy drinks such as Reign and touted for its thermogenic effects. == See also == Citrullinemia == References ==	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.00010092071, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -0.045533128, ' FOOD': -0.0026310654, ' MED': -0.5167377, 'ICAL': -1.3902034e-05}
582	Glutamic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Glutamic acid (symbol Glu or E; the anionic form is known as glutamate) is an α-amino acid that is used by almost all living beings in the biosynthesis of proteins. It is a non-essential nutrient for humans, meaning that the human body can synthesize enough for its use. It is also the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. It serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABAergic neurons. Its molecular formula is C5H9NO4. Glutamic acid exists in two optically isomeric forms; the dextrorotatory L-form is usually obtained by hydrolysis of gluten or from the waste waters of beet-sugar manufacture or by fermentation. Its molecular structure could be idealized as HOOC−CH(NH2)−(CH2)2−COOH, with two carboxyl groups −COOH and one amino group −NH2. However, in the solid state and mildly acidic water solutions, the molecule assumes an electrically neutral zwitterion structure −OOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COOH. It is encoded by the codons GAA or GAG. The acid can lose one proton from its second carboxyl group to form the conjugate base, the singly-negative anion glutamate −OOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COO−. This form of the compound is prevalent in neutral solutions. The glutamate neurotransmitter plays the principal role in neural activation. This anion creates the savory umami flavor of foods and is found in glutamate flavorings such as MSG. In Europe, it is classified as food additive E620. In highly alkaline solutions the doubly negative anion −OOC−CH(NH2)−(CH2)2−COO− prevails. The radical corresponding to glutamate is called glutamyl. The one-letter symbol E for glutamate was assigned as the letter following D for aspartate, as glutamate is larger by one methylene –CH2– group. == Chemistry == === Ionization === When glutamic acid is dissolved in water, the amino group (−NH2) may gain a proton (H+), and/or the carboxyl groups may lose protons, depending on the acidity of the medium. In sufficiently acidic environments, both carboxyl groups are protonated and the molecule becomes a cation with a single positive charge, HOOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COOH. At pH values between about 2.5 and 4.1, the carboxylic acid closer to the amine generally loses a proton, and the acid becomes the neutral zwitterion −OOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COOH. This is also the form of the compound in the crystalline solid state. The change in protonation state is gradual; the two forms are in equal concentrations at pH 2.10. At even higher pH, the other carboxylic acid group loses its proton and the acid exists almost entirely as the glutamate anion −OOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COO−, with a single negative charge overall. The change in protonation state occurs at pH 4.07. This form with both carboxylates lacking protons is dominant in the physiological pH range (7.35–7.45). At even higher pH, the amino group loses the extra proton, and the prevalent species is the doubly-negative anion −OOC−CH(NH2)−(CH2)2−COO−. The change in protonation state occurs at pH 9.47. === Optical isomerism === Glutamic acid is chiral; two mirror-image enantiomers exist: d(−), and l(+). The l form is more widely occurring in nature, but the d form occurs in some special contexts, such as the bacterial capsule and cell walls of the bacteria (which produce it from the l form with the enzyme glutamate racemase) and the liver of mammals. == History == Although they occur naturally in many foods, the flavor contributions made by glutamic acid and other amino acids were only scientifically identified early in the 20th century. The substance was discovered and identified in the year 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen, who treated wheat gluten (for which it was named) with sulfuric acid. In 1908, Japanese researcher Kikunae Ikeda of the Tokyo Imperial University identified brown crystals left behind after the evaporation of a large amount of kombu broth as glutamic acid. These crystals, when tasted, reproduced the novel flavor he detected in many foods, most especially in seaweed. Professor Ikeda termed this flavor umami. He then patented a method of mass-producing a crystalline salt of glutamic acid, monosodium glutamate. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === === Industrial synthesis === Glutamic acid is produced on the largest scale of any amino acid, with an estimated annual production of about 1.5 million tons in 2006. Chemical synthesis was supplanted by the aerobic fermentation of sugars and ammonia in the 1950s, with the organism Corynebacterium glutamicum (also known as Brevibacterium flavum) being the most widely used for production. Isolation and purification can be achieved by concentration and crystallization; it is also widely available as its hydrochloride salt. == Function and uses == === Metabolism === Glutamate is a key compound in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serve as metabolic fuel for other functional roles in the body. A key process in amino acid degradation is transamination, in which the amino group of an amino acid is transferred to an α-ketoacid, typically catalysed by a transaminase. The reaction can be generalised as such: R1-amino acid + R2-α-ketoacid ⇌ R1-α-ketoacid + R2-amino acid A very common α-keto acid is α-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Transamination of α-ketoglutarate gives glutamate. The resulting α-ketoacid product is often a useful one as well, which can contribute as fuel or as a substrate for further metabolism processes. Examples are as follows: Alanine + α-ketoglutarate ⇌ pyruvate + glutamate Aspartate + α-ketoglutarate ⇌ oxaloacetate + glutamate Both pyruvate and oxaloacetate are key components of cellular metabolism, contributing as substrates or intermediates in fundamental processes such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle. Glutamate also plays an important role in the body's disposal of excess or waste nitrogen. Glutamate undergoes deamination, an oxidative reaction catalysed by glutamate dehydrogenase, as follows: glutamate + H2O + NADP+ → α-ketoglutarate + NADPH + NH3 + H+ Ammonia (as ammonium) is then excreted predominantly as urea, synthesised in the liver. Transamination can thus be linked to deamination, effectively allowing nitrogen from the amine groups of amino acids to be removed, via glutamate as an intermediate, and finally excreted from the body in the form of urea. Glutamate is also a neurotransmitter (see below), which makes it one of the most abundant molecules in the brain. Malignant brain tumors known as glioma or glioblastoma exploit this phenomenon by using glutamate as an energy source, especially when these tumors become more dependent on glutamate due to mutations in the gene IDH1. === Neurotransmitter === Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger the release of glutamate from the presynaptic cell. Glutamate acts on ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors. In the opposing postsynaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor or the AMPA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, glutamate is involved in cognitive functions such as learning and memory in the brain. The form of plasticity known as long-term potentiation takes place at glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, neocortex, and other parts of the brain. Glutamate works not only as a point-to-point transmitter, but also through spill-over synaptic crosstalk between synapses in which summation of glutamate released from a neighboring synapse creates extrasynaptic signaling/volume transmission. In addition, glutamate plays important roles in the regulation of growth cones and synaptogenesis during brain development as originally described by Mark Mattson. === Brain nonsynaptic glutamatergic signaling circuits === Extracellular glutamate in Drosophila brains has been found to regulate postsynaptic glutamate receptor clustering, via a process involving receptor desensitization. A gene expressed in glial cells actively transports glutamate into the extracellular space, while, in the nucleus accumbens-stimulating group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, this gene was found to reduce extracellular glutamate levels. This raises the possibility that this extracellular glutamate plays an ""endocrine-like"" role as part of a larger homeostatic system. ==== GABA precursor ==== Glutamate also serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABA-ergic neurons. This reaction is catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). GABA-ergic neurons are identified (for research purposes) by revealing its activity (with the autoradiography and immunohistochemistry methods) which is most abundant in the cerebellum and pancreas. Stiff person syndrome is a neurologic disorder caused by anti-GAD antibodies, leading to a decrease in GABA synthesis and, therefore, impaired motor function such as muscle stiffness and spasm. Since the pancreas has abundant GAD, a direct immunological destruction occurs in the pancreas and the patients will have diabetes mellitus. === Flavor enhancer === Glutamic acid, being a constituent of protein, is present in foods that contain protein, but it can only be tasted when it is present in an unbound form. Significant amounts of free glutamic acid are present in a wide variety of foods, including cheeses and soy sauce, and glutamic acid is responsible for umami, one of the five basic tastes of the human sense of taste. Glutamic acid often is used as a food additive and flavor enhancer in the form of its sodium salt, known as monosodium glutamate (MSG). === Nutrient === All meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and kombu are excellent sources of glutamic acid. Some protein-rich plant foods also serve as sources. 30% to 35% of gluten (much of the protein in wheat) is glutamic acid. Ninety-five percent of the dietary glutamate is metabolized by intestinal cells in a first pass. === Plant growth === Auxigro is a plant growth preparation that contains 30% glutamic acid. === NMR spectroscopy === In recent years, there has been much research into the use of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). A glutamic acid derivative, poly-γ-benzyl-L-glutamate (PBLG), is often used as an alignment medium to control the scale of the dipolar interactions observed. === Role of glutamate in aging === == Pharmacology == The drug phencyclidine (more commonly known as PCP or 'Angel Dust') antagonizes glutamic acid non-competitively at the NMDA receptor. For the same reasons, dextromethorphan and ketamine also have strong dissociative and hallucinogenic effects. Acute infusion of the drug eglumetad (also known as eglumegad or LY354740), an agonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3) resulted in a marked diminution of yohimbine-induced stress response in bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata); chronic oral administration of eglumetad in those animals led to markedly reduced baseline cortisol levels (approximately 50 percent) in comparison to untreated control subjects. Eglumetad has also been demonstrated to act on the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) of human adrenocortical cells, downregulating aldosterone synthase, CYP11B1, and the production of adrenal steroids (i.e. aldosterone and cortisol). Glutamate does not easily pass the blood brain barrier, but, instead, is transported by a high-affinity transport system. It can also be converted into glutamine. Glutamate toxicity can be reduced by antioxidants, and the psychoactive principle of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and the non psychoactive principle cannabidiol (CBD), and other cannabinoids, is found to block glutamate neurotoxicity with a similar potency, and thereby potent antioxidants. == See also == == References == == Further reading == Nelson, David L.; Cox, Michael M.

583	Gal	PUBMED	 The α-Gal syndrome is a complex allergic disease characterized by the development of specific IgE antibodies against the carbohydrate galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal), an oligosaccharide present in cells and tissues of non-primate mammals. Individuals with IgE antibodies to α-Gal suffer from a delayed form of anaphylaxis following red meat consumption. There are several features that make the α-Gal syndrome such a unique allergic disease and distinguish it from other food allergies: (1) symptoms causing IgE antibodies are directed against a carbohydrate moiety, (2) the unusual delay between the consumption of the food and the onset of the symptoms, and (3) the fact that primary sensitization to α-Gal occurs  X-gal staining is a rapid and convenient histochemical technique used to detect reporter gene expression. A prerequisite is the creation or acquisition of transgenic reporter mouse lines, in which the bacterial LacZ gene has been knocked into the gene of interest or placed under the control of regulatory elements corresponding to the gene of interest. Expression is marked by a dark blue stain and can be detected at the single cell level, providing a robust visual readout of gene expression in the developing kidney. Here, we describe the methodology, applications, and limitations of this technique. Alpha-gal syndrome is an unconventional food allergy, characterized by IgE-mediated hypersensitivity responses to the glycan galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) and not to a food-protein. In this review, we discuss how alpha-gal syndrome reframes our current conception of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of food allergy. The development of alpha-gal IgE is associated with tick bites though the possibility of other parasites promoting sensitization to alpha-gal remains. We review the immune cell populations involved in the sensitization and effector phases of alpha-gal syndrome and describe the current understanding of why allergic responses to ingested alpha-gal can be delayed by several hours. We review the foundation of management in alpha-gal syndrome, namely avoidance, but also discuss the use of antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and the emerging role of complementary and alternative therapies, biological products, and oral immunotherapy in the management of this condition. Alpha-gal syndrome influences the safety and tolerability of medications and medical devices containing or derived from mammalian products and impacts quality of life well beyond food choices.

584	Raffinose	WIKIPEDIA	"Raffinose is a trisaccharide composed of galactose, glucose, and fructose. It can be found in beans, cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, other vegetables, and whole grains. Raffinose can be hydrolyzed to D-galactose and sucrose by the enzyme α-galactosidase (α-GAL), an enzyme synthesized by bacteria found in the large intestine. α-GAL also hydrolyzes other α-galactosides such as stachyose, verbascose, and galactinol, if present. In plants, raffinose plays a significant role in stress responses, particularly temperature sensitivity, seed vigour, resistance to pathogens, and desiccation. == Chemical properties == The raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs) are α-galactosyl derivatives of sucrose, the most common being the trisaccharide raffinose, the tetrasaccharide stachyose, and the pentasaccharide verbascose. RFOs are almost ubiquitous across the plant kingdom, being found in a large variety of seeds from many different families. They rank second only to sucrose in abundance as soluble carbohydrates. Raffinose typically crystallises as a pentahydrate white crystalline powder. It is odorless and has a sweet taste approximately 10% that of sucrose. == Biochemical properties == === Energy source === It is non-digestible in humans and other monogastric animals (pigs and poultry) who do not possess the α-GAL enzyme to break down RFOs. These oligosaccharides pass undigested through the stomach and small intestine. In the large intestine, they are fermented by bacteria that do possess the α-GAL enzyme and make short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)(acetic, propionic, butyric acids), as well as the flatulence commonly associated with eating beans and other vegetables. These SCFAs have been recently found to impart a number of health benefits. α-GAL is present in digestive aids such as the product Beano. === Plant Health === Cases of abiotic stress such as temperature, drought, and salinity have shown to increase RFO levels, especially raffinose, in plants. The functional role raffinose plays in abiotic stress tolerance is not well known, but its presence as a positive regulator of these stresses is established. Galactinol synthase (GolS) is an enzyme key in the synthesis of RFOs. Studies which modify the expression of GolS have been done to understand the role of RFOs in stress response. GolS has been found to induce salicylic acid signalling pathways and expression of defence-related genes, showing RFOs to have a role in pathogen resistance. RFOs have been seen to assist in seed germination. They are used as a source of energy and carbon for germination, and protect the seed from desiccation during the maturation process. One proposed mechanism of RFOs working against desiccation details the hydroxyl groups replacing water to maintain hydrophilicity ion the cell, which stabilizes the membrane structure and macromolecules needed for cellular function. Another mechanism, called ""vitrification"", has the cell taking on a highly viscous form, like that of a plastic solid. This maintains cellular stability and hydrogen bonding in the cell, and prevents cellular collapse. In many plants, RFOs have been seen to act as an alternative to sucrose for sugar storage and transport. == Disease relevance == Research has shown that the differential ability to utilize raffinose by strains of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae impacts their ability to cause disease and the nature of the disease. == Uses == Procedures concerning cryopreservation have used raffinose to provide hypertonicity for cell desiccation prior to freezing. Either raffinose or sucrose is used as a base substance for sucralose. Raffinose is also used in: skin moisturizers and cosmetics prebiotics (it promotes growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) food or drinks additive chiral stationary phase in HPLC == See also == Raffinose—raffinose alpha-galactosyltransferase Raphanin == Further reading == D(+)-Raffinose pentahydrate, Chemical Books == References =="	FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	{'FO': -0.00026169344, 'OD': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' PERSON': -0.0072447723, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}
585	Oxaprozin	WIKIPEDIA	Oxaprozin, also known as oxaprozinum, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Chemically, it is a propionic acid derivative. Safety and efficacy has been established in children over 6 years with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis only, and there is an increased risk of adverse reactions in the elderly population. It was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in 1983. == Medical uses == In 2015, oxaprozin was one of twenty NSAIDs included in a clinical trial to compare the efficacy of NSAIDs in the short-term treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The NSAIDs were compared by completing randomized controlled trials of NSAIDs in patients with active AS. Efficacy reported at 2–12 weeks and adverse effects were examined. Efficacy was measured by change in pain score and change in the duration of morning stiffness. A total of 26 trials with a total of 3410 participants were completed (58% of the trials had fewer than 50 participants). While all 20 NSAIDs were found to reduce more pain than the placebo, 15 were found to be significantly better. In regards to the decrease of morning stiffness and the likelihood of adverse events, there was no significant difference between NSAIDs. It was concluded that etoricoxib was more effective in reducing pain of AS, however due to small studies and insufficient evidence, no one NSAID could be determined to be the most effective treatment of AS. After etoricoxib, patients taking oxaprozin experienced the least amount of pain with fewer adverse effects than naproxen. == Adverse effects == In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. == History == Oxaprozin was developed and patented by Wyeth-Ayerst. The US patent 3578671, Oxazoles, was filed November 6, 1967 and published May 11, 1971. Following the filing of the patent, the first description of oxaprozin exhibiting anti-inflammatory properties was outlined in the article Diaryloxazole and diaylthiazolealkanoci acids: two novel series of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. This article was published in Nature in 1968. In December 1988, Wyeth-Ayerst licensed the marketing rights for the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean to Searle. Daypro became available January 5, 1993. Upon its release, “The Pink Sheet” estimated that the average whole sale price of Searle's Daypro was $112.30 for 100 (600 mg) tablets. The price was comparable to other prescription NSAIDs. == Society and culture == === FDA approval === The oxaprozin new drug application (NDA 18-841) was submitted to the FDA on August 10, 1982. The drug was granted an “NDA Day” review on June 15–16, 1992. After Searle agreed to complete seven Phase IV postmarketing studies on October 22, the FDA approved Daypro on October 29, 1992. Since the approval of Daypro by Searle, other companies have submitted abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) to the FDA. Daypro by Searle is listed as the Reference Listed Drug to prove the bioequivalence of the ANDAs. Below is a table listing all of the approved oxaprozin products. === Recalls === Advantage Dose LLC recalled oxaprozin tablets on November 26, 2008. The company was not in conformance with cGMP.

586	Diphenoxylate	WIKIPEDIA	"Diphenoxylate is a centrally active opioid drug of the phenylpiperidine series that is used as a combination drug with atropine for the treatment of diarrhea. Diphenoxylate is an opioid and acts by slowing intestinal contractions; the atropine is present to prevent drug abuse and overdose. It should not be given to children due to the risk that they will stop breathing and should not be used in people with Clostridioides difficile infection. == Medical use == Diphenoxylate is used to treat diarrhea in adults; it is only available as a combination drug with a subtherapeutic dose of atropine to prevent abuse. It should not be used in children due to the risk of respiratory depression. It does not appear harmful to a fetus but the risks have not been fully explored. It should not be taken with other central depressants like alcohol, as they can increase its risks. It should not be used for people with diarrhea caused by an infection, for example with Clostridioides difficile infection, since the slowing of peristalsis can prevent clearing of the infectious organism. == Adverse effects == The drug label (in some jurisdictions) has warnings with regard to the risk of respiratory depression, anticholinergic toxicity and opioid overdose, the risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance that people with severe diarrhea always run, and toxic megacolon in people with ulcerative colitis. Other adverse effects include numbness in the hands and feet, euphoria, depression, lethargy, confusion, drowsiness, dizziness, restlessness, headache, hallucinations, edema, hives, swollen gums, itchiness, vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite, and stomach pain. == Pharmacology == Diphenoxylate is rapidly metabolized to difenoxin; it is eliminated mostly in feces but also in urine. Like other opioids, diphenoxylate acts by slowing intestinal contractions, allowing the body to consolidate intestinal contents and prolong transit time, thus allowing the intestines to draw moisture out of them at a normal or higher rate and therefore stop the formation of loose and liquid stools; the atropine is an anticholinergic and is present to prevent drug abuse and overdose. == History and chemistry == Diphenoxylate was first synthesized by Paul Janssen at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1956 as part of a medicinal chemistry investigation of opioids. Diphenoxylate is made by combining a precursor of normethadone with norpethidine. Loperamide (Imodium) and bezitramide are analogs. Like loperamide, it has a methadone-like structure and a piperidine moiety. == Society and culture == === Pricing === In 2017 Hikma Pharmaceuticals raised the price of its liquid formulation of generic diphenoxylate-atropine in the US by 430%, from $16 to $84.00. === Regulation === In the United States, drugs containing diphenoxylate combined with atropine salts are classified as Schedule V controlled substances. (Diphenoxlate by itself is a Schedule II controlled substance.) It is on Schedule III of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, only in forms that contain, according to the Yellow List: ""not more than 2.5 milligrams of diphenoxylate calculated as base and a quantity of atropine sulfate equivalent to at least 1 per cent of the dose of diphenoxylate"". == Research == Diphenoxylate and atropine have been studied in small trials as a treatment for fecal incontinence; it appears to be less efficacious and have more adverse effects when compared with loperamide or codeine. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
598	Ursocholic acid	PUBMED	 To study the metabolism of ursocholic acid, control subjects were injected with radiolabeled cholic and ursocholic acids before and after 1 wk of 900 mg/day oral ursocholic acid. Daily samples of bile were obtained, and biliary bile acids were extracted and purified to determine bile acid kinetics. During ursocholic acid therapy ursocholic acid became the principal bile acid (35% +/- 3% of total bile acids, mean +/- S.E.M.), and the percentage of biliary cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids decreased (p less than 0.05). Cholic acid production fell from 190 +/- 15 mg/day to 135 +/- 20 mg/day (p = 0.078). The total bile acid pool was increased twofold (p less than 0.05), whereas the deoxycholic acid pool was enlarged from 440 +/- 170 mg to 1,175 +/- 90 mg (p less than 0.02). As much as 28% of the fed ursocholic acid was excreted in the urine, 85% as the free acid and 15% as the glycine conjugate. During treatment, ursocholic acid became the source for 69% +/- 11% of biliary deoxycholic acid. The time course of the deoxycholic acid specific activity was modeled as a single pool precursor-product system with a variable time delay for the C-7-dehydroxylation of cholic and ursocholic acids (mean delay 0.86 +/- 0.11 days, p less than 0.001 vs. zero delay). Most of this delay probably arises from a slow process of bacterial C-7-dehydroxylation within the colon. These results demonstrate that during ursocholic acid therapy the synthesis of primary bile acids continues whereas the formation of secondary bile acids is greatly increased. The preventive effect of 3 alpha, 7 beta, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid (ursocholic acid) and ursodeoxycholic acid on the formation of biliary cholesterol crystals was studied in mice. Cholesterol crystals developed with 80% incidence after feeding for five weeks a lithogenic diet containing 0.5% cholesterol and 0.25% sodium cholate. When 0.25% ursocholic acid or ursodeoxycholic acid was added to the lithogenic diet, the incidence as well as the grade (severity) of the gallstones were reduced. Plasma and liver cholesterol levels were decreased by ursodeoxycholic acid but not by ursocholic acid. Gallbladder cholesterol and phospholipid levels were decreased by both bile acids. The biliary bile acid level was decreased by ursocholic acid but not by ursodeoxycholic acid. After feeding ursocholic acid, its level in the bile was about 25% and the levels of cholic acid and beta-muricholic acid decreased. Fecal sterol excretion was not changed by ursocholic acid, but was increased by ursodeoxycholic acid. After feeding ursocholic acid, fecal excretion of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, and ursocholic acid increased. No differences were found between mice, with or without gallstones, in plasma and liver cholesterol levels, biliary phospholipid and bile acid levels, fecal sterol and bile acid levels, and biliary and fecal bile acid composition. The results suggest that the lower incidence of crystal formation after treatment with ursocholic acid is probably by a different mechanism than with ursodeoxycholic acid. In the mouse model, ursodeoxycholic acid exerts its effect at least partially, by decreasing cholesterol absorption. Ursocholic acid is well absorbed and excreted into bile and transformed into deoxycholic acid by the intestinal microflora in mice. To further clarify the relationship between physical-chemical characteristics of bile acids and biliary lipid secretion, we investigated the effect of ursocholic acid, the 7 beta-hydroxyepimer of cholic acid, on bile lipid secretion and composition. The study included acute duodenal infusion (1 g/h for 5 h) of ursocholic acid contrasted with a less hydrophilic bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, in 3 T-tube patients and short-term oral administration (2 wk) of ursocholic acid (10-15 mg/kg X day) to 10 gallstone patients. Following acute infusion, ursocholic acid, similarly to ursodeoxycholic acid, accounted for greater than 80% of the biliary bile acids. However, ursocholic acid induced (per micromole of secreted bile acid) a significantly lower (p less than 0.01) secretion of cholesterol (0.013 mumol) and phospholipids (0.054 mumol) than that induced by ursodeoxycholic acid (0.034 mumol of cholesterol and 0.138 mumol of phospholipids). Biliary alkaline phosphatase activity during ursocholic acid administration was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than during ursodeoxycholic acid administration. After short-term oral administration, ursocholic acid, undetectable before treatment, constituted 20.50% +/- 8.60% of the biliary bile acids. The percentage of deoxycholic acid increased from 32.35% +/- 18.79% to 47.53% +/- 16.19% (p less than 0.05). Mean saturation index decreased from a pretreatment value of 1.23 +/- 0.22 to 0.99 +/- 0.17 (p less than 0.05), but only in 4 of 10 subjects did bile become undersaturated. It is concluded that ursocholic acid, due to its higher hydrophilicity, stimulates a lower cholesterol and phospholipid output than ursodeoxycholic acid. Consequently, despite the low enrichment of the biliary bile acids with ursocholic acid, oral administration of ursocholic acid induces a reduction of bile cholesterol saturation.

603	Simvastatin or lovastatin related molecule observed in standard	PUBMED	 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a management of aggressive breast cancer, remains an unmet medical challenge. Although a wave of efforts had spurred to design novel therapeutic method of TNBC, unpredictable prognosis with lacking effective therapeutic targets along with the resistance to apoptosis seriously limited survival benefits. Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of cell death that is induced by excessive lipid peroxidation, which provide an innovative way to combat cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis plays an important role in the treatment of TNBC cells. Herein, a novel ferroptosis nanomedicine was prepared by loading simvastatin (SIM), a ferroptosis drug, into zwitterionic polymer coated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe Simvastatin is a long-established hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, first introduced in 1988. At the maximal recommended dose of 80 mg/day, it produces an average reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 47%, accompanied by reductions in very LDL-C, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B, and a modest increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The only important, although rare, adverse effect of simvastatin is myopathy, an effect shared by all members of the class; when severe, this can take the form of rhabdomyolysis, which may lead to acute renal failure. The mechanism of the myopathy is not understood. The risk is increased by certain concomitant drugs, including gemfibrozil and potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4. Simvastatin has been studied in two large outcome trials, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), and the Heart Protection Study (HPS), both of which demonstrated strikingly beneficial effects on a variety of cardiovascular outcomes, with minimal adverse effects. 4S was the first study with a cholesterol-lowering agent to demonstrate an unequivocal reduction in all-cause mortality (30%; p = 0.0003). HPS showed that the beneficial effects of simvastatin were obtainable in a broad array of patients with, or at high risk of, coronary heart disease (CHD) in categories previously little studied, including women, the elderly, patients with diabetes without known CHD, and, perhaps most importantly, patients with LDL-C well below the UK population average. Simvastatin has recently become available in many countries as a combination product with the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe. Because of its long record of safety and demonstrated ability to reduce cardiovascular risk, simvastatin has recently become available without a prescription in the UK at the 10 mg dosage level. Identifying oncological applications for drugs that are already approved for other medical indications is considered a possible solution for the increasing costs of cancer treatment. Under the hypothesis that nutritional stress through fasting might enhance the antitumour properties of at least some non-oncological agents, by screening drug libraries, we find that cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs), including simvastatin, have increased activity against cancers of different histology under fasting conditions. We show fasting's ability to increase CBIs' antitumour effects to depend on the reduction in circulating insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 and leptin, which blunts the expression of enzymes from the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and enhances cholesterol efflux from cancer cells. Ultimately, low cholesterol levels through combined fasting and CBIs reduce AKT and STAT3 activity, oxidative phosphorylation and energy stores in the tumour. Our results support further studies of CBIs in combination with fasting-based dietary regimens in cancer treatment and highlight the value of fasting for drug repurposing in oncology.

624	Mevastatin	WIKIPEDIA	Mevastatin (compactin, ML-236B) is a hypolipidemic agent that belongs to the statins class. It was isolated from the mold Penicillium citrinum by Akira Endo in the 1970s, and he identified it as a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, i.e., a statin. Mevastatin might be considered the first statin drug; clinical trials on mevastatin were performed in the late 1970s in Japan, but it was never marketed. The first statin drug available to the general public was lovastatin. Mevastatin has since been derivatized to the compound pravastatin, which is a pharmaceutical used in the lowering of cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease. In vitro, it has antiproliferative properties. A British group isolated the same compound from Penicillium brevicompactum, named it compactin, and published their results in 1976. The British group mentions antifungal properties with no mention of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. High doses inhibit growth and proliferation of melanoma cells. == Biosynthesis == Biosynthesis of mevastatin is primarily accomplished via a type 1 PKS pathway it proceeds in the PKS pathway as seen in figure 1 until it reaches a hexaketide state where it undergoes a Diels-Alder cyclization. After cyclization it continues via the PKS pathway to a nonaketide after which it is released and undergoes oxidation and dehydration. It is presumed that the oxidations are preformed by a polypeptide that is similar to cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, which is encoded by mlcC within the mevastatin gene. Lastly the biosynthesis is completed by the PKS facilitating the addition of a diketide sidechain and a methylation by SAM. Figure 1 shows mevastatin in its acid form but it can also be in the more commonly seen lactone form. This pathway was first observed in Penicillium cilrinum and was later discovered that another type of fungus, Penicillium brevicompaetum also produced mevastatin via a PKS pathway. == Pharmacology == Sustained elevations of cholesterol in the blood increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Mevastatin acts to lowers hepatic production of cholesterol by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway via the mevalonic acid pathway. When hepatic cholesterol levels are decreased it causes an increased uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduces cholesterol levels in the circulation. It has also been shown that mevastatin upregulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in mice, which is essential for maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system. == See also == Medicinal molds == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.7432603e-06, 'ICAL': 0.0}
627	(3-hydroxypentadecanoyl)lysine	PUBMED	 Targeted covalent inhibitors have gained widespread attention in drug discovery as a validated method to circumvent acquired resistance in oncology. This strategy exploits small-molecule/protein crystal structures to design tightly binding ligands with appropriately positioned electrophilic warheads. Whilst most focus has been on targeting binding-site cysteine residues, targeting nucleophilic lysine residues can also represent a viable approach to irreversible inhibition. However, owing to the basicity of the ϵ-amino group in lysine, this strategy generates a number of specific challenges. Herein, we review the key principles for inhibitor design, give historical examples, and present recent developments that demonstrate the potential of lysine targeting for future drug discovery. Lysine is an essential amino acid that serves as a building block in protein synthesis. Beside this, the metabolic activity of lysine has only recently been unraveled. Lysine metabolism is tissue specific and is linked to several renal, cardiovascular, and endocrinological diseases through human metabolomics datasets. As a free molecule, lysine takes part in the antioxidant response and engages in protein modifications, and its chemistry shapes both proteome and metabolome. In the proteome, it is an acceptor for a plethora of posttranslational modifications. In the metabolome, it can be modified, conjugated, and degraded. Here, we provide an update on integrative physiology of mammalian lysine metabolites such as α-aminoadipic acid, saccharopine, pipecolic acid, and lysine conjugates such as acetyl-lysine, and sugar-lysine conjugates such as advanced glycation end products. We also comment on their emerging associative and mechanistic links to renal disease, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.019401753}

15	64744-50-9	PUBMED	 Gabapentin is currently used as a therapeutic agent against epilepsy as well as neuropathic pain. In contrast to gabapentin, its derivative gabapentin-lactam has a pronounced neuroprotective activity. We have studied in cultured hippocampal neurons whether gabapentin-lactam has also neurotrophic effects. Gabapentin-lactam enhanced the formation of dendritic filopodia, which are necessary for synapse formation. It also induced a network of F-actin-containing neurites. In studies with time lapse microscopy, gabapentin-lactam increased the addition but also the elimination of new branches. Affinity precipitation assays showed that gabapentin-lactam increased the GTP binding of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which facilitate branch addition. Gabapentin-lactam also activated RhoA and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. In neurons transfected with dominant-negative RhoA or treated with the RhoA-inactivating C3 toxin, gabapentin-lactam increased the number of dendrites and branches. In the presence of Y-27632, which inhibits Rho kinase, newly added branches induced by gabapentin-lactam were no longer eliminated so that gabapentin-lactam increased the number of branches. Y-27632 [(+)-(R)-trans-4-(1-aminoethyl)-N-(4-pyridyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide] also prevented the gabapentin-lactam induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 [2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride] reduced the elimination of newly added branches caused by gabapentin-lactam and thus facilitated branch formation. In contrast to gabapentin-lactam, gabapentin had no effect on dendritic filopodia or motility. The effects exerted by gabapentin-lactam on dendritic arborization may be of potential therapeutic interest. Gabapentin-lactam (GBP-L) is a transformation product (TP) of gabapentin (GBP), a widely used anti-epileptic pharmaceutical. Due to its high persistence, GBP-L has been frequently detected in the surface water. However, the effects of GBP-L on aquatic organisms have not been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model organism were used to study the impacts of GBP-L in terms of embryos LC	MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.6122833}
21	Chebi:181148	PUBMED	 Gait speed is an important measure of lower extremity physical performance in older adults and is predictive of disability and mortality. The biological pathways involved in the decline of lower extremity physical performance are not well understood. We used a targeted metabolomics approach to identify plasma metabolites predictive of change in gait speed over time. Gait speed was measured at baseline and over median follow-up of 50.5 months in 504 adults, aged ≥50 years, who had two or more study visits in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Plasma metabolites were measured using targeted mass spectrometry (AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit, Biocrates). Of 148 plasma metabolites (amino acids, biogenic amines, hexoses, glycerophospholipids) measured, eight were significantly associated with gait speed at baseline, independent of age and sex: hexoses (r = -0.148, p < .001), [sphingomyelin (SM) 16:1 (r = -0.091, p = .0009), SM 18:0 (r = -0.085, p = .002), SM 18:1 (r = -0.128, p < .0001], phosphatidylcholine aa 32:3 (r = -0.088, p = .001), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 17:0 (r = 0.083, p = .003), LPC 18:1 (r = 0.089, p = .001), and LPC 18:2 (r = 0.104, p < .0001). Adjusting for baseline age, sex, and chronic diseases, baseline plasma LPC 18:2 was an independent predictor of the rate of change of gait speed over subsequent follow-up (p = .003). No other plasma metabolites were significantly associated longitudinal changes of gait speed over time. Low plasma LPC 18:2, which has previously been shown to predict impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and memory impairment, is an independent predictor of decline in gait speed in older adults.

29	3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-n-[3-({4-[3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propanamido]butyl}amino)propyl]propanamide	PUBMED	 Interventions that delay aging and protect from age-associated disease are slowly approaching clinical implementation. Such interventions include caloric restriction mimetics, which are defined as agents that mimic the beneficial effects of dietary restriction while limiting its detrimental effects. One such agent, the natural polyamine spermidine, has prominent cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects and stimulates anticancer immunosurveillance in rodent models. Moreover, dietary polyamine uptake correlates with reduced cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality in human epidemiological studies. Spermidine preserves mitochondrial function, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, and prevents stem cell senescence. Mechanistically, it shares the molecular pathways engaged by other caloric restriction mimetics: It induces protein deacetylation and depends on functional autophagy. Because spermidine is already present in daily human nutrition, clinical trials aiming at increasing the uptake of this polyamine appear feasible. Decreased cognitive performance is a hallmark of brain aging, but the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic avenues remain poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed health-protective and lifespan-extending effects of dietary spermidine, a natural autophagy-promoting polyamine. Here, we show that dietary spermidine passes the blood-brain barrier in mice and increases hippocampal eIF5A hypusination and mitochondrial function. Spermidine feeding in aged mice affects behavior in homecage environment tasks, improves spatial learning, and increases hippocampal respiratory competence. In a Drosophila aging model, spermidine boosts mitochondrial respiratory capacity, an effect that requires the autophagy regulator Atg7 and the mitophagy mediators Parkin and Pink1. Neuron-specific Pink1 knockdown abolishes spermidine-induced improvement of olfactory associative learning. This suggests that the maintenance of mitochondrial and autophagic function is essential for enhanced cognition by spermidine feeding. Finally, we show large-scale prospective data linking higher dietary spermidine intake with a reduced risk for cognitive impairment in humans. Aging involves the systemic deterioration of all known cell types in most eukaryotes. Several recently discovered compounds that extend the healthspan and lifespan of model organisms decelerate pathways that govern the aging process. Among these geroprotectors, spermidine, a natural polyamine ubiquitously found in organisms from all kingdoms, prolongs the lifespan of fungi, nematodes, insects and rodents. In mice, it also postpones the manifestation of various age-associated disorders such as cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. The specific features of spermidine, including its presence in common food items, make it an interesting candidate for translational aging research. Here, we review novel insights into the geroprotective mode of action of spermidine at the molecular level, as we discuss strategies for elucidating its clinical potential.

45	Dtxsid101108284	PUBMED	 Hydroxycinnamic acid amides are a class of secondary metabolites distributed widely in plants. We have identified two sinapoyl spermidine derivatives, N-((4'-O-glycosyl)-sinapoyl),N'-sinapoylspermidine and N,N'-disinapoylspermidine, which comprise the two major polyamine conjugates that accumulate in Arabidopsis thaliana seed. Using metabolic profiling of knockout mutants to elucidate the functions of members of the BAHD acyltransferase family in Arabidopsis, we have also identified two genes encoding spermidine disinapoyl transferase (SDT) and spermidine dicoumaroyl transferase (SCT) activities. At2g23510, which is expressed mainly in seeds, encodes a spermidine sinapoyl CoA acyltransferase (SDT) that is required for the production of disinapoyl spermidine and its glucoside in Arabidopsis seed. The structurally related BAHD enzyme encoded by At2g25150 is expressed specifically in roots and has spermidine coumaroyl CoA acyltransferase (SCT) activity both in vitro and in vivo. Phenolamides, so called hydroxycinnamic acid amides, are specialized metabolites produced in higher plants, involved in development, reproduction and serve as defence compounds in biotic interactions. Among them, trihydroxycinnamoyl spermidine derivatives were initially found to be synthetized by a spermidine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (AtSHT) in Arabidopsis thaliana and to accumulate in the pollen coat. This study reports the identification, in Malus domestica, of an acyltransferase able to complement the sht mutant of Arabidopsis. The quantitative RT-PCR expression profile of MdSHT reveals a specific expression in flowers coordinated with anther development and tapetum cell activities. Three phenolamides including N (1),N (5),N (10)-tricoumaroyl spermidine and N (1),N (5)-dicoumaroyl-N (10)-caffeoyl spermidine identified by LC/MS, were shown to accumulate specifically in pollen grain coat of apple tree. Moreover, in vitro biochemical characterization confirmed MdSHT capacity to synthesize tri-substituted spermidine derivatives with a substrate specificity restricted to p-coumaroyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA as an acyl donor. Further investigations of the presence of tri-substituted hydroxycinnamoyl spermidine conjugates in higher plants were performed by targeted metabolic analyses in pollens coupled with bioinformatic analyses of putative SHT orthologues in a wide range of available plant genomes. This work highlights a probable early evolutionary appearance in the common ancestral core Eudicotyledons of a novel enzyme from the BAHD acyltransferase superfamily, dedicated to the synthesis of trihydroxycinnamoyl spermidines in pollen coat. This pathway was maintained in most species; however, recent evolutionary divergences have appeared among Eudicotyledons, such as an organ reallocation of SHT gene expression in Fabales and a loss of SHT in Malvales and Cucurbitales. Recently, tea (Camellia sinensis) flowers have attracted increasing interest because of their content of bioactive compounds such as catechins. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of some characteristic compounds in tea flowers. A principal component analysis of metabolites using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed differences in metabolite profile between flowers and leaves of C. sinensis var. Yabukita. Four spermidine derivatives were isolated from tea flowers. One of them was determined as N(1) ,N(5) ,N(10) -tricoumaroyl spermidine based on NMR, MS and UV data. The other three were identified as feruoyl dicoumaroyl spermidine, coumaroyl diferuoyl spermidine and triferuoyl spermidine based on MS(n) data. Tricoumaroyl spermidine as the major spermidine conjugate was not detected in tea leaves. Furthermore, it decreased during floral development and mainly occurred in anthers. This study has provided the first evidence that spermidine-phenolic acid conjugates occur in tea flowers in considerable amounts. Their presence should prompt a reconsideration of the ecological role of tea flowers. From an economic point of view, tea flowers might be suitable as a raw material in the healthcare food and pharmaceutical industries.	FOOD, MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.5030788}

52	6064-68-2	PUBMED	 Chiral separation of 10, 11-dihydro-10, 11-trans-dihydroxycarbamazepine (CBZ-diol), a metabolite of carbamazepine (CBZ) with two asymmetric carbons, in serum taken from epileptic patients receiving CBZ alone for a long period, was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography using a polysaccharide stationary phase with n-hexane-ethanol (75:25, v/v) as the mobile phase. The enantiomeric ratio (S,S-/R,R-CBZ-diol) was 10.74 +/- 1.13 (mean +/- S.D.), which could demonstrate the presence of the stereospecificity in the hydrolysis of 10, 11-dihydro-10, 11-epoxycarbamazepine (CBZ-epoxide) to CBZ-diol and/or in the conversion of CBZ-diol to some metabolite such as 9-hydroxymethyl-10-carbamoylacridan. This is the first paper to report the determination of each enantiomer and the enantiomeric ratio of CBZ-diol in serum of epileptic patients who received CBZ. Oxcarbazepine (OCB) cannot be measured undecomposed by gas chromatography, not even when injected into a cooled, inert fused-silica capillary column. The bis-trimethylsilyl derivatives of the enol of OCB and of its main metabolite, 10-hydroxy-carbazepine (10-OH-CB), and the tris-trimethylsilyl derivative of carbazepine-10,11-trans-diol (CB-trans-diol) can be obtained easily at room temperature and are well suited for gas chromatographic and gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric analysis. Thermal decomposition to the substituted iminostilbene derivatives occurs only to the extent of a few per cent under the conditions described. Two gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric assays have been developed: one for the simultaneous quantification of OCB and 10-OH-CB, the other for CB-trans-diol. Both assays use carbazepine-10,11-cis-diol as the internal standard. Using 0.5 ml of plasma, limits of detection of 0.1, 0.1 and 1 ng/ml were obtained for OCB, 10-OH-CB and CB-trans-diol, respectively. CB-trans-diol is also the main metabolite of carbamazepine in patients under maintenance therapy. The kinetics of 15N-labelled CB-trans-diol derived from a single dose of (15N)carbamazepine has been measured in plasma and urine of patients and volunteers receiving (15N)carbamazepine in several studies. The study investigated the mechanism of the interaction between valproate and carbamazepine which causes raised plasma carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide concentrations with unchanged plasma carbamazepine concentrations. This interaction has usually been attributed to valproate inhibiting epoxide hydrolase, the enzyme that catalyses the biotransformation of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide to carbamazepine-10,11-trans-diol. Clearances of plasma carbamazepine, carbamazepine-epoxide and carbamazepine-diol to relevant carbamazepine metabolites present in urine were measured under steady-state conditions in 17 adults receiving carbamazepine as anticonvulsant monotherapy, and in 10 adults taking the drug together with valproate. Plasma carbamazepine-epoxide concentrations were higher, relative to carbamazepine dose, in the co-medicated patients. Plasma apparent clearances of carbamazepine, relative to drug dose, were similar whether or not valproate was taken. Formation clearances of carbamazepine-10,11-trans-diol conjugate, and probably of carbamazepine-10,11-trans-diol, were lower in subjects co-medicated with valproate, and a higher proportion of the carbamazepine dose was excreted in urine as carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide. Valproate appears to inhibit the glucuronidation of carbamazepine-10,11-trans-diol, and probably also inhibits the conversion of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide to this trans-diol derivative, rather than simply inhibiting the latter reaction only.

53	36507-30-9	PUBMED	 Carbamazepine is one of the most commonly used antiseizure medications. Although carbamazepine pharmacokinetics in epileptic patients is well described, much less is known about these processes in the patients who experienced self-poisoning episode by this drug. Therefore, the aim of our investigation was to perform population toxicokinetics of carbamazepine and its metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide in adults. Software program NONMEM and the ADVAN2 TRANS2 subroutine were used for establishing a population toxicokinetic model for the estimation of clearance and volume of distribution based on of the sum values of carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide concentrations. Our results indicated that the adult patients' ability to eliminate carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide following acute carbamazepine self-poisoning was strongly associated with the high levels of CRP and ASP, as well as by the treatment with sedation. Our study should provide better understanding of the toxicokinetics of carbamazepine taken in overdose and better management of patient population admitted to hospital. Measure of drug-mediated immune reactions that are dependent on the patient's genotype determine individual medication protocols. Despite extensive clinical trials prior to the license of a specific drug, certain patient-specific immune reactions cannot be reliably predicted. The need for acknowledgement of the actual proteomic state for selected individuals under drug administration becomes obvious. The well-established association between certain HLA molecules and drugs or their metabolites has been analyzed in recent years, yet the polymorphic nature of HLA makes a broad prediction unfeasible. Dependent on the patient's genotype, carbamazepine (CBZ) hypersensitivities can cause diverse disease symptoms as maculopapular exanthema, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or the more severe diseases Stevens-Johnson-Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Not only the association between HLA-B*15:02 or HLA-A*31:01 but also between HLA-B*57:01 and CBZ administration could be demonstrated. This study aimed to illuminate the mechanism of HLA-B*57:01-mediated CBZ hypersensitivity by full proteome analysis. The main CBZ metabolite EPX introduced drastic proteomic alterations as the induction of inflammatory processes through the upstream kinase ERBB2 and the upregulation of NFκB and JAK/STAT pathway implying a pro-apoptotic, pro-necrotic shift in the cellular response. Anti-inflammatory pathways and associated effector proteins were downregulated. This disequilibrium of pro- and anti-inflammatory processes clearly explain fatal immune reactions following CBZ administration. Carbamazepine is a widely used anticonvulsant. Its metabolite, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, has been found to display similar anticonvulsant and neurotoxic properties. While the ratio of parent to metabolite concentration varies significantly, at therapeutic doses the epoxide concentration is generally about 20% of the parent. We report a case of fatal carbamazepine overdose in which the epoxide metabolite concentration was found to be 450% higher than the parent compound, suggesting a potential role for metabolite quantification in severe toxicity.

60	Chembl5028245	PUBMED	 Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI) is a pressing public health concern. Although evidence suggests that Bifidobacterium adolescentis (B. adolescentis) can be used to treat liver disease, it is unclear if it can prevent AILI. In this report, we prove that B. adolescentis significantly attenuated AILI in mice, as demonstrated through biochemical analysis, histopathology, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Based on untargeted metabolomics and in vitro cultures, we found that B. adolescentis generates microbial metabolite hypaphorine. Functionally, hypaphorine inhibits the inflammatory response and hepatic oxidative stress to alleviate AILI in mice. Transcriptomic analysis indicates that Cry1 expression is increased in APAP-treated mice after hypaphorine treatment. Overexpression of Cry1 by its stabilizer KL001 effectively mitigates liver damage arising from oxidative stress in APAP-treated mice. Using the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database, we verified that Cry1 gene expression was also decreased in patients with APAP-induced acute liver failure. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that B. adolescentis inhibits APAP-induced liver injury by generating hypaphorine, which subsequently upregulates Cry1 to decrease inflammation and oxidative stress. Acetylcholinesterase (AChEis) inhibitors are used to treat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). l-Hypaphorine (l-HYP) is a natural indole alkaloid that has been shown to have effects on the central nervous system (CNS). The goal of this research was to synthesize l-HYP and d-HYP and test their anticholinesterasic properties in rat brain regions. l-HYP suppressed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity only in the cerebellum, whereas d-HYP inhibited AChE activity in all CNS regions studied. No cytotoxic effect on normal human cells (HaCaT) was observed in the case of l-HYP and d-HYP although an increase in cell proliferation. Molecular modeling studies revealed that d-HYP and l-HYP have significant differences in their binding mode positions and interact stereospecifically with AChE's amino acid residues. In metabolomic analysis of human milk amines, we found a previously unidentified compound. This was tentatively identified as hypaphorine, an indole alkaloid composed of tryptophan and three methyls, and with neurological and glucose-lowering effects in rodents. Hypaphorine identity was confirmed by hypaphorine synthesis, and then a fluorometric method was developed to quantify hypaphorine in milk and foods. Using dietary records, we identified peanut products as probable sources of hypaphorine. Milk from 24 lactating women showed widely varying hypaphorine, with a mean ± SD 0.34 ± 0.33 μM, and the highest concentration of 1.24 μM. Peanuts showed high hypaphorine of 70 μg/g compared to 60 and 100 μg/g in dried chickpeas and lentils. Dietary challenge in lactating women with hypaphorine-rich foods demonstrated transfer of hypaphorine into milk with hypaphorine appearance peaking 5-18 h after consumption and prolonged disappearance indicative of slow excretion or metabolism. The potential functional roles of hypaphorine in human nutrition remain to be addressed.	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.19422176, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' FOOD': -0.00016039233}
67	7695-91-2	WIKIPEDIA	α-Tocopheryl acetate (alpha-tocopherol acetate), also known as vitamin E acetate, is a form of vitamin E with D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate as the natural form and DL-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate as the synthetic form. DL-indicates the synthetic form where as D- indicates the natural form. It is the ester of acetic acid and α-tocopherol. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in the 2019 outbreak of vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI), but there is not yet sufficient evidence to rule out contributions from other chemicals. Vaporization of this ester produces toxic pyrolysis products. == Use in cosmetics == α-Tocopheryl acetate is often used in dermatological products such as skin creams. It is not oxidized and can penetrate through the skin to the living cells, where about 5% is converted to free tocopherol. Claims are made for beneficial antioxidant effects. α-Tocopheryl acetate is used as an alternative to tocopherol itself because the phenolic hydroxyl group is blocked, providing a less acidic product with a longer shelf life. It is believed that the acetate is slowly hydrolyzed after it is absorbed into the skin, regenerating tocopherol and providing protection against the sun's ultraviolet rays. Tocopheryl acetate was first synthesized in 1963 by workers at Hoffmann-La Roche. Although there is widespread use of tocopheryl acetate as a topical medication, with claims for improved wound healing and reduced scar tissue, reviews have repeatedly concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support these claims. There are reports of vitamin E-induced allergic contact dermatitis from use of vitamin E derivatives such as tocopheryl linoleate and tocopherol acetate in skin care products. Incidence is low despite widespread use. == Misuse == === Ingredient in vape liquids === On September 5, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) announced that 10 out of 18, or 56% of the samples of vape liquids sent in by states, linked to the recent vaping-related lung disease outbreak in the United States, tested positive for vitamin E acetate which had been used as a thickening agent by illicit THC vape cartridge manufacturers. On November 8, 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified vitamin E acetate as a very strong culprit of concern in the vaping-related illnesses, but has not ruled out other chemicals or toxicants as possible causes. The CDC's findings were based on fluid samples from the lungs of 29 patients with vaping-associated pulmonary injury, which provided direct evidence of vitamin E acetate at the primary site of injury in all the 29 lung fluid samples tested. Research suggests when vitamin E acetate is inhaled, it may interfere with normal lung functioning. A 2020 study found that vaporizing vitamin E acetate produced carcinogenic alkenes and benzene, but also exceptionally toxic ketene gas, which may be a contributing factor to the pulmonary injuries. == Chemistry == At room temperature, α-tocopheryl acetate is a fat-soluble liquid. It has 3 chiral centers and thus 8 stereoisomers. It is made by esterifying α-tocopherol with acetic acid. 2R,4R,8R-isomer, also known as RRR-α-tocopheryl acetate, is the most common isomer used for various purposes. This is because α-tocopherol occurs in nature primarily as RRR-α-tocopherol. α-Tocopherol acetate does not boil at atmospheric pressure and begins to degrade at 240 °C. It can be vacuum distilled: it boils at 184 °C at 0.01 mmHg, at 194 °C (0.025 mmHg) and at 224 °C (0.3 mmHg). In practice, it is not degraded notably by air, visible light or UV-radiation. It has a refractive index of 1.4950–1.4972 at 20 °C. α-Tocopherol acetate is hydrolyzed to α-tocopherol and acetic acid under suitable conditions or when ingested by people. == References ==	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD	PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL, FOOD	{'PERSON': -0.62812775, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0, ',': -0.102180466, ' MED': -0.66959035, 'ICAL': -2.8160932e-06, ' FOOD': -0.001675541}

79	2-acetamido-3-(r)-lactate-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose	PUBMED	 MurNAc etherases cleave the unique D-lactyl ether bond of the bacterial cell wall sugar N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). Members of this newly discovered family of enzymes are widely distributed among bacteria and are required to utilize peptidoglycan fragments obtained either from the environment or from the endogenous cell wall (i.e., recycling). MurNAc etherases are strictly dependent on the substrate MurNAc possessing a free reducing end and a phosphoryl group at C6. They carry a single conserved sugar phosphate isomerase/sugar phosphate-binding (SIS) domain to which MurNAc 6-phosphate is bound. Two subunits form an enzymatically active homodimer that structurally resembles the isomerase module of the double-SIS domain protein GlmS, the glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase. Structural comparison provides insights into the two-step lyase-type reaction mechanism of MurNAc etherases: beta-elimination of the D-lactic acid substituent proceeds through a 2,3-unsaturated sugar intermediate to which water is subsequently added. The bacterial cell wall consists of a three-dimensional peptidoglycan layer, composed of peptides linked to the sugars N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and GlcNAc. Unlike other bacteria, the pathogenic Tannerella forsythia, a member of the red complex group of bacteria associated with the late stages of periodontitis, lacks biosynthetic pathways for MurNAc production and therefore obtains MurNAc from the environment. Sugar kinases play a crucial role in the MurNAc recycling process, activating the sugar molecules by phosphorylation. In this study, we present the first crystal structures of a MurNAc kinase, called murein sugar kinase (MurK), in its unbound state as well as in complexes with the ATP analog β-γ-methylene adenosine triphosphate (AMP-PCP) and with MurNAc. We also determined the crystal structures of K1058, a paralogous MurNAc kinase of T. forsythia, in its unbound state and in complex with MurNAc. We identified the active site and residues crucial for MurNAc specificity as the less bulky side chains of S133, P134, and L135, which enlarge the binding cavity for the lactyl ether group, unlike the glutamate or histidine residues present in structural homologs. In establishing the apparent kinetic parameters for both enzymes, we showed a comparable affinity for MurNAc (K Phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase (MraY, translocase I) catalyses the first step of the lipid-linked cycle of reactions of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis. MraY is the target for five families of nucleoside antibacterial natural products: the tunicamycins, the mureidomycins (also pacidamycins, napsamycins), the liposidomycins, the muraymycins, and the capuramycins. Recent structure-activity studies on these families have led to the identification of active pharmacophores, and insight into their mechanisms of action. This step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis is also the target for the bacteriolytic E protein from bacteriophage phiX174, and for cyclic peptides of the amphomycin family which complex the undecaprenyl phosphate co-substrate. The mechanisms of enzyme inhibition by these agents are discussed, and the state of knowledge regarding the transmembrane structure, active site, and catalytic mechanism of MraY. The availability of high throughput assays and prospects of MraY as an antibacterial target are also discussed.	MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.0059216893}

136	H-phe-met-oh	PUBMED	 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a growth factor composed of 53 amino acids (6.2 kDa) and is secreted by ectodermic cells, monocytes, kidneys, and duodenal glands (1). EGF stimulates growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF and at least seven other growth factors and their transmembrane receptor kinases play important roles in cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. The EGF receptor (EGFR) family consists of four transmembrane receptors: EGFR (HER1/erbB-1), HER2 (erbB-2/neu), HER3 (erbB-3), and HER4 (erbB-4) (2). HER1, HER3, and HER4 comprise three major functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. No ligand has been clearly identified for HER2; however, HER2 can be activated as a result of ligand binding to other HER receptors with the formation of receptor homodimers and/or heterodimers (3). HER1 and HER2 are overexpressed on many solid tumor cells such as breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, and colon cancers (4-6). The high levels of HER1 and HER2 expression on cancer cells are associated with poor patient prognosis because high levels are related to increased proliferation (7-10). Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG Bombesin (BBN or BN)-like peptide is an analog of human gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) that binds to GRP receptors (GRP-R) (1). Both GRP and BN share an amidated C-terminus sequence homology of seven amino acids (Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH First purified 11 years ago from clam ganglia, FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2) was quickly demonstrated to be cardioactive in several molluscan species. Subsequent discovery that FMRFamide, or FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs), were present in mammalian central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract prompted investigations into the effect of FMRFamide on mammals. FMRFamide has now been shown to be cardioexcitatory in mammals, to inhibit morphine-induced antinociception, and to block morphine-, defeat-, and deprivation-induced feeding. It also inhibits colonic propulsive motility, induces behavioral effects when administered intrathecally, and has been reported to have amnesic effects in rodents. A proposal has arisen that a FMRFamide-like substance is an endogenous opioid antagonist and has stimulated a search for such a substance. However, FMRFamide has only weak affinity for opioid receptors and not all the actions of FMRFamide appear to be explained by actions at opioid receptors. Alternative mechanisms have been proposed which suggest that FMRFamide acts as a neuromodulator.	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	INFO	{'INFO': -0.00061010564}

146	(r/s)-colchicine	WIKIPEDIA	"Colchicine is a medication used to prevent and treat gout, to treat familial Mediterranean fever and Behçet's disease, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. The American College of Rheumatology recommends colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids in the treatment of gout. Other uses for colchicine include the management of pericarditis. Colchicine is taken by mouth. The injectable route of administration for colchicine can be lethal. In 2008, the FDA removed all injectable colchicine from the US market. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index, so overdosing is a significant risk. Common side effects of colchicine include gastrointestinal upset, particularly at high doses. Severe side effects may include pancytopenia (low blood cell counts) and rhabdomyolysis (damage to skeletal muscle), and the medication can be deadly in overdose. Whether colchicine is safe for use during pregnancy is unclear, but its use during breastfeeding appears to be safe. Colchicine works by decreasing inflammation via multiple mechanisms. Colchicine, in the form of the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was used as early as 1500 BC to treat joint swelling. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1961. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 197th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. Colchicine is used in plant breeding to induce polyploidy, in which the number of chromosomes in plant cells are doubled. This helps produce larger, hardier, faster-growing, and in general, more desirable plants than the normally diploid parents. == Medical uses == === Gout === Colchicine is an alternative for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs when treating gout. Low doses (1.2 mg in one hour, followed by 0.6 mg an hour later) appear to be well tolerated and may reduce gout symptoms and pain, perhaps as effectively as NSAIDs. At higher doses, side effects (primarily diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting) limit its use. For treating gout symptoms, colchicine is taken orally, with or without food, as symptoms first appear. Subsequent doses may be needed if symptoms worsen. There is preliminary evidence that daily colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) may be effective as a long-term prophylaxis when used with allopurinol to reduce the risk of increased uric acid levels and acute gout flares; adverse gastrointestinal effects may occur, though overall the risk of serious side effects is low. === Risk of cardiovascular disorders === In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved a low-dose regimen of colchicine (tradename LODOCO) to reduce the risk of further disorders in adults with existing cardiovascular diseases. As an anti-inflammatory drug, Lodoco in a dose of 0.5 mg per day reduced the rate of cardiovascular events by 31% in people with established atherosclerosis and by 23% in people with recent myocardial infarction. Colchicine was most effective in combination therapy with lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory medications. The mechanism for this effect of colchicine is unknown. === Other conditions === Colchicine is also used as an anti-inflammatory agent for long-term treatment of Behçet's disease. It appears to have limited effect in relapsing polychondritis, as it may only be useful for the treatment of chondritis and mild skin symptoms. It is a component of therapy for several other conditions, including pericarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, biliary cirrhosis, various vasculitides, pseudogout, spondyloarthropathy, calcinosis, scleroderma, and amyloidosis. Research regarding the efficacy of colchicine in many of these diseases has not been performed. It is also used in the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever, in which it reduces attacks and the long-term risk of amyloidosis. Colchicine is effective for prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. In people with recent myocardial infarction (recent heart attack), it has been found to reduce risk of future cardiovascular events. Its clinical use may grow to include this indication. == Contraindications == Long-term (prophylactic) regimens of oral colchicine are absolutely contraindicated in people with advanced kidney failure (including those on dialysis). About 10–20% of a colchicine dose is excreted unchanged by the kidneys; it is not removed by hemodialysis. Cumulative toxicity is a high probability in this clinical setting, and a severe neuromyopathy may result. The presentation includes a progressive onset of proximal weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Colchicine toxicity can be potentiated by the concomitant use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. == Adverse effects == Deaths – both accidental and intentional – have resulted from overdose of colchicine. Typical side effects of moderate doses may include gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and neutropenia. High doses can also damage bone marrow, lead to anemia, and cause hair loss. All of these side effects can result from inhibition of mitosis, which may include neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis. == Toxicity == According to one review, colchicine poisoning by overdose (range of acute doses of 7 to 26 mg) begins with a gastrointestinal phase occurring 10–24 hours after ingestion, followed by multiple organ dysfunction occurring 24 hours to 7 days after ingestion, after which the affected person either declines into multiple organ failure or recovers over several weeks. Colchicine can be toxic when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed in the eyes. It can cause a temporary clouding of the cornea and be absorbed into the body, causing systemic toxicity. Symptoms of colchicine overdose start 2 to 24 hours after the toxic dose has been ingested, and include burning in the mouth and throat, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. This can cause hypovolemic shock due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the gastrointestinal tract, which can be fatal. If the affected persons survive the gastrointestinal phase of toxicity, they may experience multiple organ failure and critical illness. This includes kidney damage, which causes low urine output and bloody urine; low white blood cell counts that can last for several days; anemia; muscular weakness; liver failure; hepatomegaly; bone marrow suppression; thrombocytopenia; and ascending paralysis leading to potentially fatal respiratory failure. Neurologic symptoms are also evident, including seizures, confusion, and delirium; children may experience hallucinations. Recovery may begin within six to eight days and begins with rebound leukocytosis and alopecia as organ functions return to normal. Long-term exposure to colchicine can lead to toxicity, particularly of the bone marrow, kidney, and nerves. Effects of long-term colchicine toxicity include agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, low white blood cell counts, aplastic anemia, alopecia, rash, purpura, vesicular dermatitis, kidney damage, anuria, peripheral neuropathy, and myopathy. No specific antidote for colchicine is known, but supportive care is used in cases of overdose. In the immediate period after an overdose, monitoring for gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac dysrhythmias, and respiratory depression is appropriate, and may require gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal or gastric lavage. Because colchicine is so toxic, chemists are continuing to try to synthesize derivatives of the molecule that decrease the toxicity. The most important aspect of these derivatives is that they keep the tropolone ring (the ring with the methoxy group and the carbonyl) intact to retain the mechanistic properties of the molecule. === Mechanism of toxicity === With overdoses, colchicine becomes toxic as an extension of its cellular mechanism of action via binding to tubulin. Cells so affected undergo impaired protein assembly with reduced endocytosis, exocytosis, cellular motility, and interrupted function of heart cells, culminating in multiple organ failure. === Epidemiology === In the United States, several hundred cases of colchicine toxicity are reported annually, about 10% of which end with serious morbidity or mortality. Many of these cases are intentional overdoses, but others were accidental; for example, if the drug were not dosed appropriately for kidney function. Most cases of colchicine toxicity occur in adults. Many of these adverse events resulted from the use of intravenous colchicine. == Drug interactions == Colchicine interacts with the P-glycoprotein transporter, and the CYP3A4 enzyme involved in drug and toxin metabolism. Fatal drug interactions have occurred when colchicine was taken with other drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, such as erythromycin or clarithromycin. People taking macrolide antibiotics, ketoconazole, or cyclosporine, or those who have liver or kidney disease, should not take colchicine, as these drugs and conditions may interfere with colchicine metabolism and raise its blood levels, potentially increasing its toxicity abruptly. Symptoms of toxicity include gastrointestinal upset, fever, muscle pain, low blood cell counts, and organ failure. People with HIV/AIDS taking atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir may experience colchicine toxicity. Grapefruit juice and statins can also increase colchicine concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === In gout, inflammation in joints results from the precipitation of uric acid as needle-like crystals of monosodium urate in and around synovial fluid and soft tissues of joints. These crystal deposits cause inflammatory arthritis, which is initiated and sustained by mechanisms involving various proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines. Colchicine accumulates in white blood cells and affects them in a variety of ways - decreasing motility, mobilization (especially chemotaxis), and adhesion. Under preliminary research are various mechanisms by which colchicine may interfere with gout inflammation: Inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to its constitutive protein, tubulin As availability of tubulin is essential to mitosis, colchicine may inhibit mitosis Inhibits activation and migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation Interferes with the inflammasome complex found in neutrophils and monocytes that mediate interleukin-1β activation, a component of inflammation Inhibits superoxide anion production in response to urate crystals Interrupts mast cell and lysosome degranulation Inhibits release of glycoproteins that promote chemotaxis from synovial cells and neutrophils Generally, colchicine appears to inhibit multiple proinflammatory mechanisms, while enabling increased levels of anti-inflammatory mediators. Apart from inhibiting mitosis, colchicine inhibits neutrophil motility and activity, leading to a net anti-inflammatory effect, which has efficacy for inhibiting or preventing gout inflammation. === Pharmacokinetics === Colchicine appears to be a peripherally selective drug with limited brain uptake due to binding to P-glycoprotein. == History == The plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was described for treatment of rheumatism and swelling in the Ebers Papyrus (circa 1500 BC), an Egyptian medical text. It is a toxic alkaloid and secondary metabolite. Colchicum extract was first described as a treatment for gout in De Materia Medica by Pedanius Dioscorides, in the first century AD. Use of the bulb-like corms of Colchicum to treat gout probably dates to around 550 AD, as the ""hermodactyl"" recommended by Alexander of Tralles. Colchicum corms were used by the Persian physician Avicenna, and were recommended by Ambroise Paré in the 16th century, and appeared in the London Pharmacopoeia of 1618. Colchicum use waned over time, likely due to the severe gastrointestinal side effects preparations caused. In 1763, Colchicum was recorded as a remedy for dropsy (now called edema) among other illnesses. Colchicum plants were brought to North America by Benjamin Franklin, who had gout himself and had written humorous doggerel about the disease during his stint as United States Ambassador to France. Colchicine was first isolated in 1820 by French chemists P. S. Pelletier and J. B. Caventou. In 1833, P. L. Geiger purified an active ingredient, which he named colchicine. It quickly became a popular remedy for gout. The determination of colchicine's structure required decades, although in 1945, Michael Dewar made an important contribution when he suggested that, among the molecule's three rings, two were seven-member rings. Its pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects for gout were linked to its ability to bind with tubulin. The full synthesis of colchicine was achieved by the Swiss organic chemist Albert Eschenmoser in 1959. === United States === ==== Colcrys, the Unapproved Drugs Initiative, and controversy ==== In 2006 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a safety program called the Unapproved Drugs Initiative—through which the FDA sought more rigorous testing of efficacy and safety of colchicine and other unapproved drugs. This program was in response to multiple deaths caused by ""unapproved products."". After the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was signed into law in June 24, 1938, the FDA had the regulatory authority to mandate drugs be reviewed for safety prior to approval. Drugs approved before June 24, 1938, were grandfathered, as long as their manufacturing, ingredients, and labeling remained unchanged. In 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the FD&C Act gave the FDA the authority to also require efficacy as a condition for drug approval. Drugs approved after June 24, 1938, but before 1962 had a limited time to be reviewed for efficacy to remain on the market. This was known as the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI). As of today there are only a handful of drugs still on the DESI list and in 2006, the FDA stated it was not aware of any grandfathered drugs. By 2006, URL Pharma decided to research colchicine to see if this unapproved product could gain legal FDA approval. Colchicine was a narrow therapeutic index drug that was implicated in numerous death leading to the FDA forcefully removing injectable colchicine from the US Market. At this time oral colchicine was being used to treat gout attacks. The only placebo control trial conducted using colchicine for acute gout attacks instructed physicians to give colchicine until pain relief or toxicity. All patients on the colchicine arm had adverse events. Despite its toxicity, unapproved oral colchicine was still prescribed using this dosing regimen. In addition, at this time, oral colchicine was also used to treat the often fatal disease Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). In July 2009, the FDA approved colchicine as a monotherapy for the treatment of three different indications (familial Mediterranean fever, acute gout flares, and for the prophylaxis of gout flares). This resulted in a 3-year regulatory market exclusivity in the acute and chronic gout indications and a 7-year exclusivity on the FMF indication. In addition, there are 17 patents on colchicine, listed in the FDA Orange Book which may confer additional exclusivity. At the time of approval, there were no FDA-approved single-agent colchicine products (brand or generic) in the United States. The unapproved, illegally marketed colchicine products were forcibly removed by the FDA in October 2010. ===== Controversy ===== The events that led to the approval of Colcrys, the clearance of the illegally sold non-FDA approved colchicine products, Colcrys pricing, and the sale of URL Pharma still are controversial today. Before the Colcrys approval, unapproved colchicine products were being illegally sold in the United States for under 10 cents a pill. These products were also labeled in an unsafe manner and not manufactured under FDA inspection. URL conducted one Phase 3 clinical trial and at least 12 other trials to gain the approval of Colcrys. URL Pharma priced Colcrys at $4.85 a pill drawing the ire of many groups. In 2012, Asia's biggest drugmaker, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., acquired URL Pharma for $800 million including the rights to Colcrys. == Sources and uses == === Physical properties === Colchicine has a melting point of 142-150 °C. It has a molecular weight of 399.4 grams per mole. === Structure === Colchicine has one stereocenter located at carbon 7. The natural configuration of this stereocenter is S. The molecule also contains one chiral axis - the single bond between rings A and C. The natural configuration of this axis is aS. Although colchicine has four stereoisomers, the only one found in nature is the aS,7s configuration. === Light sensitivity === Colchicine is a light-sensitive compound, so needs to be stored in a dark bottle. Upon exposure to light, colchicine undergoes photoisomerization and transforms into structural isomers, called lumicolchicine. After this transformation, colchicine is no longer effective in its mechanistic binding to tubulin, so is not effective as a drug. === Regulation === It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002) and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities that produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. === Formulations and dosing === Trade names for colchicine are Colcrys or Mitigare, which are manufactured as a dark– and light-blue capsule having a dose of 0.6 mg. Colchicine is also prepared as a white, yellow, or purple pill (tablet) having a dose of 0.6 mg. Colchicine is typically prescribed to mitigate or prevent the onset of gout, or its continuing symptoms and pain, using a low-dose prescription of 0.6 to 1.2 mg per day, or a high-dose amount of up to 4.8 mg in the first 6 hours of a gout episode. With an oral dose of 0.6 mg, peak blood levels occur within one to two hours. For treating gout, the initial effects of colchicine occur in a window of 12 to 24 hours, with a peak within 48 to 72 hours. It has a narrow therapeutic window, requiring monitoring of the subject for potential toxicity. Colchicine is not a general pain-relief drug, and is not used to treat pain in other disorders. === Biosynthesis === According to laboratory research, the biosynthesis of colchicine involves the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine as precursors. Giving radioactive phenylalanine-2-14C to C. byzantinum, another plant of the family Colchicaceae, resulted in its incorporation into colchicine. However, the tropolone ring of colchicine resulted from the expansion of the tyrosine ring. Radioactive feeding experiments of C. autumnale revealed that colchicine can be synthesized biosynthetically from (S)-autumnaline. That biosynthetic pathway occurs primarily through a phenolic coupling reaction involving the intermediate isoandrocymbine. The resulting molecule undergoes O-methylation directed by S-adenosylmethionine. Two oxidation steps followed by the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring lead to the formation of the tropolone ring contained by N-formyldemecolcine. N-formyldemecolcine hydrolyzes then to generate the molecule demecolcine, which also goes through an oxidative demethylation that generates deacetylcolchicine. The molecule of colchicine appears finally after the addition of acetyl-coenzyme A to deacetylcolchicine. === Purification === Colchicine may be purified from Colchicum autumnale (autumn crocus) or Gloriosa superba (glory lily). Concentrations of colchicine in C. autumnale peak in the summer, and range from 0.1% in the flower to 0.8% in the bulb and seeds. === Botanical use and seedless fruit === Colchicine is widely used in plant breeding by inducing polyploidy in plant cells to produce new or improved varieties, strains, and cultivars. When used to induce polyploidy in plants, colchicine cream is usually applied to a growth point of the plant, such as an apical tip, shoot, or sucker. Seeds can be presoaked in a colchicine solution before planting. Since chromosome segregation is driven by microtubules, colchicine alters cellular division by inhibiting chromosome segregation during mitosis; half the resulting daughter cells, therefore, contain no chromosomes, while the other half contains double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., tetraploid instead of diploid), and lead to cell nuclei with double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., tetraploid instead of diploid). While this would be fatal in most higher animal cells, in plant cells, it is not only usually well-tolerated, but also frequently results in larger, hardier, faster-growing, and in general more desirable plants than the normally diploid parents. For this reason, this type of genetic manipulation is frequently used in breeding plants commercially. When such a tetraploid plant is crossed with a diploid plant, the triploid offspring are usually sterile (unable to produce fertile seeds or spores), although many triploids can be propagated vegetatively. Growers of annual triploid plants not readily propagated vegetatively cannot produce a second-generation crop from the seeds (if any) of the triploid crop and need to buy triploid seed from a supplier each year. Many sterile triploid plants, including some trees and shrubs, are becoming increasingly valued in horticulture and landscaping because they do not become invasive species and do not drop undesirable fruit and seed litter. In certain species, colchicine-induced triploidy has been used to create ""seedless"" fruit, such as seedless watermelons (Citrullus lanatus). Since most triploids do not produce pollen themselves, such plants usually require cross-pollination with a diploid parent to induce seedless fruit production. The ability of colchicine to induce polyploidy can be also exploited to render infertile hybrids fertile, for example in breeding triticale (× Triticosecale) from wheat (Triticum spp.) and rye (Secale cereale). Wheat is typically tetraploid and rye diploid, with their triploid hybrid infertile; treatment of triploid triticale with colchicine gives fertile hexaploid triticale. == References == == External links == ""Colchicine : Biotoxin"".

166	90055-48-4	PUBMED	 Common genetic variation in CYP2C19 (cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19) *2 and *3 alleles leads to a loss of functional protein, and carriers of these loss-of-function alleles when treated with clopidogrel have significantly reduced clopidogrel active metabolite levels and high on-treatment platelet reactivity resulting in increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, especially after percutaneous coronary intervention. The Food and Drug Administration has issued a black box warning advising practitioners to consider alternative treatment in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers who might receive clopidogrel and to identify such patients by genotyping. However, routine clinical use of genotyping for CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention is not recommended by clinical guidelines because of lack of prospective evidence. To address this critical gap, TAILOR-PCI (Tailored Antiplatelet Initiation to Lessen Outcomes due to Decreased Clopidogrel Response After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) is a large, pragmatic, randomized trial comparing point-of-care genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy with routine care to determine whether identifying CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele patients prospectively and prescribing alternative antiplatelet therapy is beneficial. Antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay of treatment and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). The P2Y Information from two mothers indicates that minute quantities of clopidogrel and its metabolites are excreted into milk and one breastfed infant had trivial serum levels. Two mothers and the manufacturer reported that no adverse effects have been observed in breastfed infants with maternal clopidogrel use during lactation in a small number of cases. It appears that clopidogrel can be used in nursing mothers.	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.032421544, 'ICAL': 0.0}
169	149289-30-5	PUBMED	 Increased systemic exposure of the antidepressant venlafaxine and increased risk of side effects has previously been observed in patients with defective CYP2D6 function [poor metabolisers (PMs)]. The aim of this study was to evaluate venlafaxine pharmacokinetics in carriers of one functional and one defective CYP2D6 allele [heterozygous extensive metabolisers (HEMs)]. Data was collected retrospectively from a therapeutic drug-monitoring database. All CYP-genotyped patients with steady-state serum concentration measurements of venlafaxine and metabolites were included in the study. Patients were divided in groups: *1/*1 [homozygous extensive metabolisers (EMs)], *1/*3, *4 or *5 (HEMs) and *4/*4 (PMs). Dose-adjusted serum concentrations of venlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, N-desmethylvenlafaxine, and the metabolic ratio (O-desmethylvenlafaxine/venlafaxine) were compared between the different genotype groups. The sum of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine serum concentrations was not significantly different between genotype groups. Metabolic ratio was 50% lower in HEMs (n = 18) than in EMs (n = 20) (p < 0.05). Serum concentration of N-desmethylvenlafaxine was 5.5-fold higher in HEMs (p < 0.01) and 22-fold higher in PMs (p < 0.001) than in EMs. The study showed a shift in the metabolic pathway resulting in substantially higher levels of N-desmethylvenlafaxine in HEMs than in EMs. The metabolic pattern of venlafaxine in HEMs was similar to previous observations in PMs and possibly represents an increased risk of venlafaxine-related side effects in HEM patients. This paper focuses on the development of a novel miniaturized molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) and ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method to determine venlafaxine (VEN), O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV), and N-desmethylvenlafaxine (NDV) in plasma samples. The molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was prepared by the precipitation polymerization approach; VEN, metacrylic acid, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile, and toluene were used as template, monomer, crosslinker, initiator, and porogen solvent, respectively. MIP and of the non-imprinted control polymer (NIP) sorbents were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. MIP phase presented higher extraction efficiency (MISPE, using plasma samples spiked with VEN) than the NIP phase (84 and 49% recovery rates, respectively). Analysis of other antidepressants with different chemical structures by MISPE-UHPLC-MS/MS attested to the selectivity of the developed MIP. The developed method presented precision assays with coefficients of variation (CV) smaller than 15%; accuracy assays with relative standard error (RSE%) values ranging from -12 to 16%, and linear ranges from 3 to 700ngmL(-1) for VEN, from 5 to 700ngmL(-1) for ODV, and from 3 to 500ngmL(-1) for NDV. The coefficients of determination (r(2)) were higher than 0.995. The lack-of-fit test also attested to the linearity of this method. This method was successfully applied to determine VEN, NDV, and ODV in plasma samples from depressed patients undergoing therapy with VEN. CYP2D6*9, CYP2D6*10 and CYP2D6*41 are the most frequent reduced-function CYP2D6 alleles in Caucasians. Despite lacking in vivo evidence, they are collectively classified with an enzyme activity score of 0.5. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the functional impact of CYP2D6*9, CYP2D6*10 and CYP2D6*41 on CYP2D6 metabolism in a large patient population. A total of 1003 patients (mainly Caucasians) with data on CYP2D6 genotype and serum concentrations of venlafaxine and metabolites were included from a therapeutic drug monitoring service in Oslo, Norway. The O-desmethyl-to-N-desmethyl-venlafaxine metabolic ratio (MR) was applied as CYP2D6 biomarker and compared (Mann-Whitney) between carriers of CYP2D6*9-10 (merged) and CYP2D6*41, either combined with CYP2D6*1 or non-coding (null) alleles. MR subgroup estimates were obtained by multiple linear regression for calculations of CYP2D6*9-10 and CYP2D6*41 activity scores. MR was significantly lower in carriers of CYP2D6*41 than CYP2D6*9-10 (P < 0.002). The majority of CYP2D6*41/null carriers (86.7%) had MR in the observed range of CYP2D6null/null carriers compared with the minority of CYP2D6*9-10/null carriers (17.4%). CYP2D6 genotype explained 60.7% of MR variability in the multivariate analysis providing subgroup estimates of 9.54 (95% CI; 7.45-12.20), 3.55 (2.06-6.10), 1.33 (0.87-2.05) and 0.47 (0.35-0.61) in carriers of CYP2D6*1/null (n = 269), CYP2D6*9-10/null (n = 17), CYP2D6*41/null (n = 30) and CYP2D6null/null (n = 95), respectively. Based on these estimates, the calculated activity score of CYP2D6*41 was 0.095 compared to 0.34 for CYP2D6*9-10. CYP2D6 metabolism measured as the O/N-desmethylvenlafaxine ratio is significantly lower in Scandinavian carriers of CYP2D6*41 vs. CYP2D6*9-10. Thus, these alleles should be differentiated when classifying CYP2D6 phenotype from genotype.	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.00025084958, 'ICAL': 0.0}

The structure displays both inter- and intra-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen bonding. In the title compound, C21H14BrNO2S, the dihedral angle between the planes of the benzo-thia-zole and phenyl-methanone groups is 63.4 (2)°. In the crystal, pairs of C-H⋯N hydrogen bonds link the mol-ecules to form inversion dimers, which are further linked by C-H⋯O inter-actions into chains along the c axis. C-H⋯π and π-π inter-actions [centroid-centroid distance = 3.863 (1) Å] further stabilize the mol-ecular assembly. The title compound, C24H20N2OS, crystallizes with two independent mol-ecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit, in each of which the cyclo-hexene rings adopt half-chair conformations. The mean plane of the indole ring is twisted from those of the phenyl and thio-phene rings by 69.0 (7) and 8.3 (5)°, respectively, in mol-ecule A and by 65.4 (9) and 6.7 (5)°, respectively, in mol-ecule B. The dihedral angles between the mean planes of the phenyl and thio-phene rings are 63.0 (4) and 58.8 (9)° in mol-ecules A and B, respectively. In the crystal, N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds lead to the formation of an infinite chain along [101]. In addition, π-π stacking inter-actions are observed involving the thio-phene and pyrrole rings of the two mol-ecules, with a shortest inter-centroid distance of 3.468 (2) Å.

The exploration of a complex regulatory network in host metabolism homeostasis may raise a novel strategy for the prevention of T2D. A variety of metabolites serve as the endogenous ligand of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and play an important role in the pathophysiological process of T2D and insulin resistance, however, the roles of remaining endogenous metabolites in insulin resistance and GPCRs still need to be explored. The effect of LPC (17:0) on hyperglycemia were proved in high fat diet (HFD) mice, and qPCR with Western blot technology was used to verify the downstream targets. Herein, we found that LPC (17:0) reduced blood glucose and alleviated insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders in high-fat diet induced (HFD) mice through activating GLP-1 and promoting insulin secretion. Further, the LPC (17:0) was found to stimulate intestinal GPR120, GPR35 and CALCR, with potential effect on GLP-1 stimulation. The above observation revealed LPC (17:0) as an endogenous protective factor with potential role on GPCRs, and it provided theoretical support for the development of LPC (17:0) as a potent drug candidate or health food additive for insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.

211	2-aminooctadecane-1,3-diol	WIKIPEDIA	Safingol is a lyso-sphingolipid protein kinase inhibitor. It has the molecular formula C18H39NO2 and is a colorless solid. Medicinally, safingol has demonstrated promising anticancer potential as a modulator of multi-drug resistance and as an inducer of necrosis. The administration of safingol alone has not been shown to exert a significant effect on tumor cell growth. However, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that combining safingol with conventional chemotherapy agents such as fenretinide, vinblastine, irinotecan and mitomycin C can dramatically potentiate their antitumor effects. In phase I clinical trials, it was found to be safe to co-administer with cisplatin, but caused reversible dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. == Mechanism == The underlying mechanism by which safingol induces cell death is poorly understood. It is believed to exert a variety of inhibitory effects, resulting in a series of cascades that result in accidental necrotic cell death brought about by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mediated by autophagy. Increased autophagic activity has been associated with increased cellular death, although it is unclear if there is any causative relationship between the two. Because autophagy normally plays a pro-survival role by impeding apoptosis, it is curious that it may play a role in cell death following safingol exposure. Safingol competitively competes with phorbol dibutyrate at regulatory domains of the protein kinase C family, inhibiting the activation of such enzymes as PKCβ-I, PKCδ, and PKCε. Safingol can also inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3k), which is a critical component of the mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways. Furthermore, safingol, like other sphingolipids, has been found to inhibit glucose uptake. This results in oxidative stress, leading to the generation of ROS that are both time and concentration-dependent. Together, the inhibitory signaling effects (particularly of PKCε and PI3k) and the presence of ROS synergize to induce autophagy. Following autophagic activity, cell death is eventually induced by an as of yet unknown mechanism. Missing from this cellular death are any signs of apoptotic induction such as characteristic changes to nuclear morphology and PARP cleavage. Instead, several hallmarks of necrosis are observed, such as caspase-independent cell death, the loss of plasma membrane integrity, the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the depletion of intracellular ATP. However, the involvement of RIPK1 has not been observed, suggesting that this necrosis is accidental in nature and not programmed. One potential explanation for safingol’s cytotoxicity is that high concentrations result in ROS-related molecular and cellular damage that is beyond repair. Therefore, autophagy does not directly contribute to death, but is rather a failed attempt to preserve cell viability. However, not only does this hypothesis warrants further testing, but safingol has demonstrated unusual regulatory effects on other pathways capable of regulating autophagy. As expected, a decrease in glucose heightens AMPK phosphorylation. However, an initial increase in phosphorylated mTOR is also observed, which eventually reduces after several hours. The mTOR pathway normally inhibits autophagy, as is induced by heightened glucose uptake. Therefore, decreasing glucose levels should suppress the mTOR pathway, allowing for autophagy. While autophagy is indeed observed following exposure of safingol, it is intriguing that mTOR is activated initially. Modulations in Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and endonuclease G from mitochondria are also thought to play a role in safingol-induced cellular death by regulating autophagy. Safingol is also a putative inhibitor of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK), which catalyzes the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), an important mediator of cancer cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. This ability further contributes to its anticancer potential. It can also affect the balance of other endogenous sphingolipids, particularly ceramide and dihydroceramide, which have been implicated in autophagic induction and ROS production. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -7.107425e-06, 'ICAL': 0.0}

215	542-44-9	PUBMED	 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 85%. Mougeotia nummuloides and Spirulina major have been reported to possess anticancer properties. 1-Monopalmitin (1-Mono) is the principle active constituent in these natural plants. It is debating whether 1-Mono exerts antitumor effects. Therefore, we explored the role of 1-Mono in lung cancer in vitro. Results showed that 1-Mono significantly inhibited A549 and SPC-A1 cell proliferation, induced G2/M arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, it suppressed the protein expression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). It was further demonstrated that 1-Mono activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, suppression of PI3K/Akt activities with LY294002 and Wortmannin partially attenuated 1-Mono-mediated anticancer activities, indicating that 1-Mono-induced antitumor effects is dependent on PI3K/Akt pathway. 1-Mono induced cytoprotective autophagy since autophagy inhibitor Chloroquine dramatically enhanced 1-Mono-induced cytotoxicity. In summary, our results showed 1-Mono kills lung cancer through PI3K/Akt pathway, providing novel options for lung cancer administration. The surface pressure (pi)-area (A) isotherms and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) images of monopalmitin and beta-casein mixed films spread on buffered water at pHs 5 and 7 and at 20 degrees C were determined as a function of the mass fraction of monopalmitin in the mixture (X). The structural characteristics and morphology of monopalmitin-beta-casein mixed films are dependent on surface pressure, pH, and monolayer composition. The prevalence of monopalmitin in the interface increases with the amount of monopalmitin in the mixture and at higher pi. At the monopalmitin monolayer collapse the mixed film is practically dominated by the presence of monopalmitin. However, some degree of interactions exist between monopalmitin and beta-casein in the mixed film, and these interactions are more pronounced as the monolayer is compressed at the highest surface pressures.

216	1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine	PUBMED	 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections, imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems globally. While lipid disorders have been observed in the lungs of infants and young children with RSV pneumonia, the specific characterization of these lipids and their roles in the development and progression of RSV pneumonia remain largely unexplored. To address this tissue, we established a non-targeted high-resolution lipidomics platform using UHPLC-Q-Exactive-MS to analyze lipid profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained from mice infected with RSV. Through the lipidomics analysis, a total of 72 lipids species were identified, with 40 lipids were significantly changed. Notably, the primary changes were observed in ether phospholipids and lysophospholipids. Furthermore, a targeted lipidomics analysis utilizing UHPLC-QQQ-MS/MS was developed to specifically assess the levels of lysophospholipids, including lysophosphocholine 16:0 (LPC 16:0), lysophosphoethanolamine 16:0 (LPE 16:0) and lysophosphoglycerol 16:0 (LPG 16:0), in RSV-infected mice compared to control mice. Animal experiments revealed that LPE 16:0, rather than LPC 16:0 or LPG 16:0, provided protection against RSV-induced weight loss, reduced lung viral load, regulated immune cells and mitigated lung injury in mice afflicted with RSV pneumonia. In summary, our findings suggested that the host responses to RSV infection pathology are closely with various lipid metabolic. Additionally, our results elucidated novel biological functions of LPE 16:0 and offering new avenues for drug development against RSV pneumonia.	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	INFO	{'INFO': -0.73158306}

220	1-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol	PUBMED	 This study investigated differences in absorption and metabolism between 1,3-oleate-2-palmitate glycerol (OPO) and 1-oleate-2-palmitate-3-linoleate glycerol (OPL) using C57BL/6J mice. OPL was associated with higher postprandial plasma total triacylglycerol (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, and the ratio of LDL-C to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared to those of OPO ( Recent studies have shown that 1-oleo-2-palmito-3-linoleyl glycerol (OPL) is the most abundant triacylglycerol in human breast milk in China. Epidemiologic studies have shown that sn-2 palmitate improves the absorption of fatty acids and calcium in infants. However, there have been few studies of the specific mechanism by which OPL affects intestinal function. In the present study, we have characterized the effects of various levels of OPL supplementation on the development of the intestinal epithelium and the intestinal microbiota of neonatal mice. OPL supplementation increased the body masses and intestinal lengths of weaned mice and promoted defecation. These positive effects were related to the effect of OPL to promote the development of intestinal villi and crypts. OPL increased the expression of the intestinal stem cell markers Olfm4 and Sox9 in the jejunum and ileum, which promoted their differentiation into goblet cells and Paneth cells. It also promoted the integrity of the epithelial barrier by increasing the secretion of mucin 2 and lysozyme 1 and the expression of the tight junction proteins occludin, ZO1, claudin 2, and claudin 3. More importantly, we found that low dose-OPL promotes the transformation of the intestinal microbiota of neonatal mice to the mature state in 3-month-old mice, increases the proportion of Firmicutes, and reduces the proportion of Bacteroidota. The proportions of anaerobic genera of bacteria, such as Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Lachnoclostridium, Ligilactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium were higher, as were the key producers of short-chain fatty acids, such as Bacteroides and Blautia. OPL also increased the butyric acid content of the feces, which significantly correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus. High-dose OPL tended to be more effective at promoting defecation and the development of the villi and crypts, but these effects did not significantly differ from those achieved using the lower dose. A low dose of OPL was more effective at increasing the butyric acid content and causing the maturation of microbes. In summary, the OPL supplementation of newborn mice promotes the establishment of the intestinal epithelial layer structure and barrier function, and also promotes the transformation of the intestinal microbiota to a mature state. This study lays a theoretical foundation for the inclusion of OPL in infant formula and provides a scientific basis for the development of intestinal health products. Numerous studies have shown that 1-oleate-2-palmitate-3-linoleate (OPL) is the most abundant TAG in Chinese human milk, which is significantly different from human milk in other countries, where 1,3-oleate-2-palmitate (OPO) is the most abundant TAG. However, there have been few studies revealing the nutritional outcomes of OPL. Hence, the present study investigated the effects of an OPL supplementation diet on mice's nutritional outcomes, including liver lipid parameters, inflammation, lipidomes in the liver and serum, and the gut bacterial community. A high OPL (HOPL) diet decreased body weight, weight gain, liver TG, TC and LDL-C, and TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in mice relative to low OPL (LOPL) diet. Lipidomics results showed that HOPL feeding elevated the level of anti-inflammatory lipids, such as very long-chain Cer, LPC, PC and ether TG in the liver, and serum PC, and reduced the level of oxidized lipids (liver OxTG, HexCer 18:1;2O/22:0) and serum TG.

228	Schembl22394571	PUBMED	 Plasmalogen-specific, calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) is activated during myocardial ischemia. Accordingly, we have assessed the activation of myocardial protein kinases by the iPLA2 product, lysoplasmenylcholine. Lysoplasmenylcholine-activated protein kinase activity from heart cytosol fractionated on a DE-52 column was identified as cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) based on the following: (1) protein kinase activity stimulated by cAMP and lysoplasmenylcholine co-eluted on sequential chromatographic steps; (2) lysoplasmenylcholine-activated protein kinase activity was inhibited by the PKA inhibitor, PKI; and (3) the unprimed PKA form generated from the primed form of PKA was activated by cAMP and lysoplasmenylcholine. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism for PKA activation by lysoplasmenylcholine. We demonstrated previously that thrombin stimulation of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) results in release of choline lysophospholipids [lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPtdCho) and lysoplasmenylcholine (lysoPlsCho)]. These amphiphilic metabolites have been implicated in arrhythmogenesis following the onset of myocardial ischemia, but studies examining their direct effects on the vasculature remain limited. We and others have shown that thrombin and lysoPtdCho can increase cell surface adhesion molecules and adherence of circulating inflammatory cells to the endothelium. This study supports our hypothesis that these changes may be mediated, at least in part, by lysoPlsCho, thus implicating this metabolite as an inflammatory mediator in the coronary vasculature and a modulator of the progression of atherosclerosis. Apical stimulation of HCAEC with thrombin resulted in the production and release of choline lysophospholipids from the apical surface of the HCAEC monolayer. Basolateral stimulation had no effect on choline lysophospholipid production or release from either the apical or basolateral surface of the HCAEC monolayer. Incubation of HCAEC with lysoPlsCho or lysoPtdCho resulted in similar increases in HCAEC surface expression of P-selectin and E-selectin. Furthermore, lysoPlsCho increased cell surface expression of P-selectin, E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 with a time course similar to that of thrombin stimulation. Increased presence of cell surface adhesion molecules may contribute to the significant increase in adherence of neutrophils to either thrombin- or lysoPlsCho-stimulated HCAEC. These results demonstrate that the presence of thrombin at sites of vascular injury in the coronary circulation, resulting in increased choline lysophospholipid release from the HCAEC apical surface, has the potential to propagate vascular inflammation by upregulation of adhesion molecules and recruitment of circulating inflammatory cells to the endothelium. We previously reported that lysoplasmenylcholine (LPlasC) altered the action potential (AP) and induced afterdepolarizations in rabbit ventricular myocytes. In this study, we investigated how LPlasC alters excitation-contraction coupling using edge-motion detection, fura-PE3 fluorescent indicator, and perforated and whole cell patch-clamp techniques. LPlasC increased contraction, myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity, systolic and diastolic free Ca(2+) levels, and the magnitude of Ca(2+) transients concomitant with increases in the maximum rates of shortening and relaxation of contraction and the rising and declining phases of Ca(2+) transients. In some cells, LPlasC induced arrhythmias in a pattern consistent with early and delayed aftercontractions. LPlasC also augmented the caffeine-induced Ca(2+) transient with a reduction in the decay rate. Furthermore, LPlasC enhanced L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca,L)) and outward currents. LPlasC-induced alterations in contraction and I(Ca,L) were paralleled by its effect on the AP. Thus these results suggest that LPlasC elicits distinct, potent positive inotropic, lusitropic, and arrhythmogenic effects, resulting from increases in Ca(2+) influx, Ca(2+) sensitivity, sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) Ca(2+) release and uptake, SR Ca(2+) content, and probably reduction in sarcolemmal Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange.

230	[1-myristoyl-glycerol-3-yl]phosphonylcholine	PUBMED	 Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) occurs when drug exposure causes inflammation of the lung interstitium. DILD can be caused by different types of drugs, and some DILD patterns results in a high mortality rate; hence, DILD poses a serious problem in clinical practice as well as drug development, and strategies to diagnose and distinguish DILD from other lung diseases are necessary. We aimed to identify novel biomarkers for DILD by performing lipidomics analysis on plasma samples from patients with acute and recovery phase DILD. Having identified lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) as candidate biomarkers for DILD, we determined their concentrations using validated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry biomarker assays. In addition, we evaluated the ability of LPCs to discriminate patients with acute phase DILD from those with recovery phase DILD, DILD-tolerant, or other lung diseases, and characterized their association with clinical characteristics. Lipidomics analysis revealed a clear decrease in LPC concentrations in the plasma of patients with acute phase DILD. In particular, LPC(14:0) had the highest discriminative index against recovery phase and DILD-tolerant patients. LPC(14:0) displayed no clear association with causal drugs, or subjects' backgrounds, but was associated with disease severity. Furthermore, LPC(14:0) was able to discriminate between patients with DILD and other lung diseases, including idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and lung disease associated with connective tissue disease. LPC(14:0) is a promising biomarker for DILD that could improve the diagnosis of DILD and help to differentiate DILD from other lung diseases, such as idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and connective tissue disease.

235	Ncgc00024645-01	PUBMED	 Checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) is a potentially fatal adverse event characterized by new pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study aims to explore the interplay between lung microbiota, dysregulated metabolites, and host immunity in CIP. We recruited thirteen hospitalized CIP patients, eleven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients, and ten new-onset non-small cell lung cancer patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The percentages of immune cells were determined using manual counting and flow cytometry. Interactions among microbiota, metabolites, and lymphocytes were analyzed using cultured mouse splenocytes and human T cells. Proteobacteria emerged as the dominant phylum, notably abundant in both the CIP and IPF groups. Vibrio, Halomonas, Mangrovibacter, and Salinivibrio were the predominant microbiota because of their discriminative abundance patterns. Vibrio (r = 0.72, P-adj = 0.007) and Halomonas (r = 0.65, P-adj = 0.023) demonstrated strong correlations with lymphocytes. Vibrio metschnikovii and Mangrovibacter plantisponsors were more abundant in the CIP group than in the IPF group. Lauroylcarnitine, a key intermediary metabolite co-occurring with the predominant microbiota, exhibited a potent effect on cytokine secretion by mouse and human T cells, notably enhancing IFN-γ and TNF-α production from CD4 and CD8 cells in vitro. Lauroylcarnitine, co-occurring with the predominant lung microbiota in CIP, could activate T cells in vitro. These findings suggest potential involvement of lung microbiota and acylcarnitine metabolism dysregulation in the pathogenesis of CIP. This work was supported by Peking University People's Hospital Scientific Research Development Funds (RDJ2022-15) and Provincial Key Clinical Specialty Capacity Building Project 2020 (Department of the Respiratory Medicine). We investigated optimum formulation characteristics in the nasal absorption of salmon calcitonin (sCT) by incorporation of acylcarnitines. Nasal sCT formulations were administered to anesthetized rats. Plasma calcium level was measured and pharmacological bioavailability (P.bioav) was calculated. Nasal sCT absorption was significantly enhanced by carnitines with acyl groups of 12 or more carbon atoms. Enhancement by lauroylcarnitine chloride (LCC) was observed at its critical micelle concentration and reached a plateau at the concentration of 0.1 percent. Optimal absorption was achieved at a molar ratio of LCC to sCT of 5:1. Enhancement was not influenced by osmolarity and maximum enhancement was obtained at pHs 3.1 and 4.0. The 12-carbon LCC was the strongest enhancer among acylcarnitines. Micelle formation played a key role in this enhancement effect.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -9.3291674e-05}
236	Lauramidopropylbetaine	WIKIPEDIA	Cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) is a mixture of closely related organic compounds derived from coconut oil and dimethylaminopropylamine. CAPB is available as a viscous pale yellow solution and it is used as a surfactant in personal care products and animal husbandry. The name reflects that the major part of the molecule, the lauric acid group, is derived from coconut oil. Cocamidopropyl betaine to a significant degree has replaced cocamide DEA. == Production == Despite the name cocamidopropyl betaine, the molecule is not synthesized from betaine. Instead it is produced in a two-step manner, beginning with the reaction of dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) with fatty acids from coconut or palm kernel oil (lauric acid, or its methyl ester, is the main constituent). The primary amine in DMAPA is more reactive than the tertiary amine, leading to its selective addition to form an amide. In the second step chloroacetic acid reacts with the remaining tertiary amine to form a quaternary ammonium center (a quaternization reaction). CH3(CH2)10COOH + H2NCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 → CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 + ClCH2CO2H + NaOH → CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N+(CH3)2CH2CO2− + NaCl + H2O == Chemistry == CAPB is a fatty acid amide that contains a long hydrocarbon chain at one end and a polar group at the other. This allows CAPB to act as a surfactant and as a detergent. It is a zwitterion, consisting of both a quaternary ammonium cation and a carboxylate. == Specifications and properties == Cocamidopropyl betaine is used as a foam booster in shampoos. It is a medium-strength surfactant also used in bath products like hand soaps. It is also used in cosmetics as an emulsifying agent and thickener, and to reduce the irritation that purely ionic surfactants would cause. It also serves as an antistatic agent in hair conditioners, which most often does not irritate skin or mucous membranes. However, some studies indicate it is an allergen. CAPB is also used as a co-surfactant with Sodium dodecyl sulfate for promoting the formation of gas hydrates. CAPB, as an additive, helps to scale up the gas hydrates' formation process. CAPB is obtained as an aqueous solution in concentrations of about 30%. Typical impurities of leading manufacturers today: Sodium monochloroacetate < 5 ppm Amidoamine (AA) < 0.3% Dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) < 15 ppm Glycerol < 3% The impurities AA and DMAPA are most critical, as they have been shown to be responsible for skin sensitization reactions. These by-products can be avoided by a moderate excess chloroacetate and the exact adjustment of pH value during betainization reaction accompanied by regular analytical control. == Safety == CAPB has been claimed to cause allergic reactions in some users, but a controlled pilot study has found that these cases may represent irritant reactions rather than true allergic reactions. Furthermore, results of human studies have shown that CAPB has a low sensitizing potential if impurities with amidoamine (AA) and dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) are low and tightly controlled. Other studies have concluded that most apparent allergic reactions to CAPB are more likely due to amidoamine. Cocamidopropyl betaine was voted 2004 Allergen of the Year by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. == See also == Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine == References ==	PERSONAL CARE	PERSONAL CARE	{'PERSON': -7.226629e-06, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}

240	89576-29-4	PUBMED	 Myocardial infarction (MI) is a serious cardiovascular disease, which presents different pathophysiological changes with the prolongation of the disease. Compound danshen dripping pills (CDDP) has obvious advantages in MI treatment and widely used in the clinic. However, the current studies were mostly focused on the endpoint of CDDP intervention, lacking the dynamic attention to the disease process. It is of great value to establish a dynamic research strategy focused on the changes in pharmacodynamic substances for guiding clinical medication more precisely. It is aimed to explore the dynamic regulating pattern of CDDP on MI based on metabolic trajectory analysis, and then clarify the variation characteristic biomarkers and pharmacodynamic substances in the intervention process. The MI model was successfully prepared by coronary artery left anterior descending branch ligation, and then CDDP intervention was given for 28 days. Endogenous metabolites and the components of CDDP in serum were measured by LC/MS technique simultaneously to identify dynamic the metabolic trajectory and screen the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances at different points. Finally, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to simulate the core pharmacodynamic substances and core target binding, then validated at the genetic and protein level by Q-PCR and western blotting technology. CDDP performed typical dynamic regulation features on metabolite distribution, biological processes, and pharmacodynamic substances. During 1-7 days, it mainly regulated lipid metabolism and inflammation, the Phosphatidylcholine (PC(18:1(9Z/18:1(9Z)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z)), SM(d18:1/24:1(15Z)), SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z))) were the main characteristic biomarkers. Lipid metabolism was the mainly regulation pathway during 14-21 days, and the characteristic biomarkers were the Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE(0:0/20:0), PE-NMe2(22:1(13Z)/15:0)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z))). At 28 days, in addition to inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism also played the most important role. Correspondingly, Lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC(20:0/0:0)), Lysophosphatidylserine (LPS(18:0/0:0)) and Fatty acids (Linoelaidic acid) were the characteristic biomarkers. Based on the results of metabolite distribution and biological process, the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances during the intervention were further identified. The results showed that various kinds of Saponins and Tanshinones as the important active ingredients performed a long-range regulating effect on MI. And the other components, such as Tanshinol and Salvianolic acid B affected Phosphatidylcholine and Sphingomyelin through Relaxin Signaling pathway during the early intervention. Protocatechualdehyde and Rosmarinic acid affected Lysophosphatidylethanolamine and Sphingomyelin through EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance during the late intervention. Tanshinone IIB and Isocryptotanshinone via PPAR signaling pathway affected Lysophosphatidylcholine, Lysophosphatidylserine, and Fatty acids. The dynamic regulating pattern was taken as the entry point and constructs the dynamic network based on metabolic trajectory analysis, establishes the dynamic correlation between the drug-derived components and the endogenous metabolites, and elucidates the characteristic biomarkers affecting the changes of the pharmacodynamic indexes, systematically and deeply elucidate the pharmacodynamic substance and mechanism of CDDP on MI. It also enriched the understanding of CDDP and provided a methodological reference for the dynamic analysis of complex systems of TCM.

241	1-oleoylglycerophosphocholine	PUBMED	 The metabolic alterations occurring within the arterial architecture during atherosclerosis development remain poorly understood, let alone those particular to each arterial tunica. We aimed first to identify, in a spatially resolved manner, the specific metabolic changes in plaque, media, adventitia, and cardiac tissue between control and atherosclerotic murine aortas. Second, we assessed their translatability to human tissue and plasma for cardiovascular risk estimation. In this observational study, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) was applied to identify region-specific metabolic differences between atherosclerotic (n=11) and control (n=11) aortas from low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice, via histology-guided virtual microdissection. Early and advanced plaques were compared within the same atherosclerotic animals. Progression metabolites were further analyzed by MSI in 9 human atherosclerotic carotids and by targeted mass spectrometry in human plasma from subjects with elective coronary artery bypass grafting (cardiovascular risk group, n=27) and a control group (n=27). MSI identified 362 local metabolic alterations in atherosclerotic mice (log2 fold-change ≥1.5;  An altered phospholipid metabolism occurs in atherosclerosis, affecting both the aorta and the adjacent heart tissue. Plaque-progression lipids LPC(18:0) and LPA(18:1), as identified by MSI on tissue, reflect cardiovascular risk in human plasma. In human subjects and animal models with acute and chronic lung injury, the bioactive lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is elevated in lung lining fluids. The increased LPC can promote an inflammatory microenvironment resulting in lung injury. Furthermore, pathological lung conditions are associated with upregulated phospholipase A2 (PLA2), the predominant enzyme producing LPC in tissues by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. However, the lung cell populations responsible for increases of LPC have yet to be systematically characterized. The goal was to investigate the LPC generation by bronchial epithelial cells in response to pathological mediators and determine the major LPC species produced. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were challenged by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for 1 or 6 h, and condition medium and cells collected for quantification of predominant LPC species by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The cells were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for PLA2. The direct effects of LPC in inducing inflammatory activities on NHBE were assessed by transepithelial resistance as well as expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). VEGF stimulation of NHBE for 1 or 6 h, significantly increased concentrations of LPC16:0, LPC18:0, and LPC18:1 in condition medium compared to control. The sPLA2-selective inhibitor (oleyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) inhibited the VEGF-induced release of LPC16:0 and LPC18:1 and PLA2 activity. In contrast, NHBE stimulated with TNF did not induce LPC release. VEGF did not increase mRNA of PLA2 subtypes sPLA2-X, sPLA2-XIIa, cPLA2-IVa, and iPLA2-VI. Exogenous LPC treatment increased expression of IL-8 and MMP-1, and reduced the transepithelial resistance in NHBE. Our findings indicate that VEGF-stimulated bronchial epithelial cells are a key source of extracellular LPCs, which can function as an autocrine mediator with potential to induce airway epithelial inflammatory injury.

243	Schembl19639066	PUBMED	 Concentrations of extracellular glycine in the CNS are regulated by two Na(+)/Cl(-) -dependent glycine transporters, GlyT1 and GlyT2. Selective inhibitors of GlyT1 have been developed for the treatment of schizophrenia, whilst selective inhibitors of GlyT2 are analgesic in animal models of pain. We have assessed a series of endogenous lipids as inhibitors of GlyT1 and GlyT2. Human GlyT1 and GlyT2 were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the inhibitory actions of a series of acylcarnitines on glycine transport were measured using electrophysiological techniques. Oleoyl-L-carnitine inhibited glycine transport by GlyT2, with an IC(50) of 340 nM, which is 15-fold more potent than the previously identified lipid inhibitor N-arachidonyl-glycine. Oleoyl-L-carnitine had a slow onset of inhibition and a slow washout. Using a series of chimeric GlyT1/2 transporters and point mutant transporters, we have identified an isoleucine residue in extracellular loop 4 of GlyT2 that conferred differences in sensitivity to oleoyl-L-carnitine between GlyT2 and GlyT1. Oleoyl-L-carnitine is a potent non-competitive inhibitor of GlyT2. Previously identified GlyT2 inhibitors show potential as analgesics and the identification of oleoyl-L-carnitine as a novel GlyT2 inhibitor may lead to new ways of treating pain.

246	Monoelaidin	PUBMED	 The existing information supports the use of this material as described in this safety assessment. Glyceryl monooleate was evaluated for genotoxicity, repeated dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity, local respiratory toxicity, phototoxicity/photoallergenicity, skin sensitization, and environmental safety. Data show that glyceryl monooleate is not genotoxic. Data on glyceryl monooleate provide a calculated margin of exposure (MOE) > 100 for the repeated dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity endpoints. The skin sensitization endpoint was completed using the dermal sensitization threshold (DST) for reactive materials (64 μg/cm Glyceryl monooleate (GMO) is one of the most popular amphiphilic lipids, which, in the presence of different amounts of water and a proper amount of stabilizer, can promote the development of well defined, thermodynamically stable nanostructures, called lyotropic liquid crystal dispersions. The aim of this study is based on the design, characterization, and evaluation of the cytotoxicity of lyotropic liquid crystal nanostructures containing a model anticancer drug such as doxorubicin hydrochloride. The drug is efficiently retained by the GMO nanosystems by a remote loading approach. The nanostructures prepared with different non-ionic surfactants (poloxamers and polysorbates) are characterized by different physico-chemical features as a function of several parameters, i.e., serum stability, temperature, and different pH values, as well as the amount of cryoprotectants used to obtain suitable freeze-dried systems. The nanostructures prepared with poloxamer 407 used as a stabilizer show an increased toxicity of the entrapped drug on breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) due to their ability to sensitize multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells through the inhibition of specific drug efflux transporters. Moreover, the interaction between the nanostructures and the cells occurs after just a few hours, evidencing a huge cellular uptake of the nanosystems. This study investigated the preparation and characterization of glyceryl monooleate- (GMO) based drug delivery system containing ofloxacin for the treatment of otitis externa. Acetate buffer (pH 4.5) containing dissolved ofloxacin was added to molten GMO as an aqueous phase, this resulted in the formation of a cubic and a reverse hexagonal phases. The release behavior of ofloxacin from the drug delivery system was studied using three different methods. The mechanism of drug release using paddles/dissolution apparatus and Franz diffusion cells followed Higuchi and Fickian diffusion models; whereas intrinsic release rate method showed zero-order kinetics. The intrinsic release rate was estimated and found to be 187.2 µg/cm(2)/h. The release mechanisms were similar irrespective of the loaded ofloxacin amount, however, the higher drug load displayed higher release rate. The drug delivery system was proven to be microbiologically effective by using agar diffusion method, against Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The GMO/ofloxacin formulation was stable for 6 months after preparation at room temperature as measured with respect to phase stability and antibacterial activity.

After performing several chromatographic steps, we successfully isolated the conjugated linoleic acid derivative, 9-hydroxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (9-HODE). Synthesized 9-HODE and its analogs showed inhibitory activity against fat accumulation. The linoleic acid metabolite 9S-HODE was prepared by means of tomato fruit lipoxygenase and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to a high steric purity as judged by chiral-phase HPLC. 9S-HODE caused in the concentration range between 0.01 and 1 microM a strong dose-dependent inhibition of the migration of both cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells and of phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated human mononuclear cells. The effect was not observed with another polyenoic fatty acid metabolite, 15S-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE).

These methylene-interrupted dienes were reacted with dimethyl disulfide and I2 for 72 h at 50 degrees C and the tetrahydrothiopyran, thietane, and tetrahydrothiophene derivatives thus obtained were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Each configurational isomer displayed a unique gas chromatography trace for the 4-, 5- and 6-membered ring cyclization products thus obtained.

309	1097774-72-5	WIKIPEDIA	"Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic medication used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections, including osteomyelitis (bone) or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, acute otitis media (middle ear infections), and endocarditis. It can also be used to treat acne, and some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In combination with quinine, it can be used to treat malaria. It is available by mouth, by injection into a vein, and as a cream or a gel to be applied to the skin or in the vagina. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, and pain at the site of injection. It increases the risk of hospital-acquired Clostridioides difficile colitis about fourfold and thus is only recommended for use when other antibiotics are not appropriate. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein. Clindamycin was first made in 1966 from lincomycin. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 147th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Clindamycin is used primarily to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin may be used to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne. === Acne === For the treatment of acne, in the long term, the combined use of topical clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide was similar to salicylic acid plus benzoyl peroxide. Topical clindamycin plus topical benzoyl peroxide is more effective than topical clindamycin alone. === Susceptible bacteria === It is most effective against infections involving the following types of organisms: Aerobic Gram-positive cocci, including some members of the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (e.g. pneumococcus) genera, but not enterococci. Anaerobic, Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria, including some Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella, although resistance is increasing in Bacteroides fragilis. Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (such as Pseudomonas, Legionella, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella) are resistant to clindamycin, as are the facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae. A notable exception is Capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus: 0.016 μg/mL – >256 μg/mL Streptococcus pneumoniae: 0.002 μg/mL – >256 μg/mL Streptococcus pyogenes: <0.015 μg/mL – >64 μg/mL === D-test === When testing a gram-positive culture for sensitivity to clindamycin, it is common to perform a ""D-test"" to determine if there is a sub-population of bacteria present with the phenotype known as iMLSB. This phenotype of bacteria are resistant to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B group of antibiotics, however, the resistance mechanism is only induced by the presence of 14-membered ring macrolides, such as erythromycin. During a D-test, bacteria of the iMLSB phenotype demonstrate in vitro erythromycin-induced in vitro resistance to clindamycin. This is because of the activity of the macrolide-inducible plasmid-encoded erm gene. To perform a D-test, an agar plate is inoculated with the bacteria in question and two drug-impregnated disks (one with erythromycin, one with clindamycin) are placed 15–20 mm apart on the plate. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is D-shaped, the test result is positive. Despite the apparent susceptibility to clindamycin in the absence of erythromycin, a positive D-test precludes therapeutic use of clindamycin. This is because the erythromycin-inducible erm gene is prone to mutations causing the inducible activity to switch to constitutive (permanently switched on). This in turn, may lead to the therapeutic failure of clindamycin. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is circular, the test result is negative and clindamycin can be used. === Malaria === Given with chloroquine or quinine, clindamycin is effective and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, and is the treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin should not be used as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing. === Other === Clindamycin may be useful in skin and soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Many strains of MRSA are still susceptible to clindamycin; however, in the United States spreading from the West Coast eastwards, MRSA is becoming increasingly resistant. While it has been used in intraabdominal infections, such use is generally not recommended due to resistance. Clindamycin is used in cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes the death of the bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis). Clindamycin has been proven to decrease the risk of premature births in women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis during early pregnancy to about a third of the risk of untreated women. The combination of clindamycin and quinine is the standard treatment for severe babesiosis. Clindamycin may also be used to treat toxoplasmosis, and, in combination with primaquine, is effective in treating mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Clindamycin, either applied to skin or taken by mouth, may also be used in hidradenitis suppurativa. == Side effects == Common adverse drug reactions associated with systemic clindamycin therapy – found in over 1% of people – include: diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps and/or rash. High doses (both intravenous and oral) may cause a metallic taste. Common adverse drug reactions associated with topical formulations – found in over 10% of people – include: dryness, burning, itching, scaliness, or peeling of skin (lotion, solution); erythema (foam, lotion, solution); oiliness (gel, lotion). Additional side effects include contact dermatitis. Common side effects – found in over 10% of people – in vaginal applications include fungal infection. Rarely – in less than 0.1% of people – clindamycin therapy has been associated with anaphylaxis, blood dyscrasias, polyarthritis, jaundice, raised liver enzyme levels, renal dysfunction, cardiac arrest, and/or hepatotoxicity. === Clostridioides difficile === Pseudomembranous colitis is a potentially lethal condition commonly associated with clindamycin, but which also occurs with other antibiotics. Overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results in the production of a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Use of clindamycin during pregnancy is generally considered safe. Clindamycin is classified as compatible with breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics, however, the WHO categorizes it as ""avoid if possible"". It is classified as L2 probably compatible with breastfeeding according to Medications and Mothers' Milk. A 2009 review found it was likely safe in breastfeeding mothers, but did find one complication (hematochezia) in a breastfed infant which might be attributable to clindamycin. LactMed lists potentially negative gastrointestinal effects in babies whose mothers take it while breastfeeding but did not see that as justification to stop breastfeeding. == Interactions == Clindamycin may prolong the effects of neuromuscular-blocking drugs, such as succinylcholine and vecuronium. Its similarity to the mechanism of action of macrolides and chloramphenicol means they should not be given simultaneously, as this causes antagonism and possible cross-resistance. == Chemistry == Clindamycin is a semisynthetic derivative of lincomycin, a natural antibiotic produced by the actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis. It is obtained by 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. The synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in 1966. It has been on the market since 1968. Clindamycin is white or yellow powder that is very soluble in water. The topically used clindamycin phosphate is a phosphate-ester prodrug of clindamycin. == Mechanism of action == Clindamycin has a primarily bacteriostatic effect. At higher concentrations, it may be bactericidal. It is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, in a similar way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others. The binding is reversible. Clindamycin is more effective than lincomycin. The X-ray crystal structures of clindamycin bound to ribosomes (or ribosomal subunits) derived from Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Haloarcura marismortui have been determined; the structure of the closely related antibiotic lincomycin bound to the 50S ribosomal subunit of Staphylococcus aureus has also been reported. == Society and culture == === Economics === Clindamycin is available as a generic medication and is relatively inexpensive. === Available forms === Clindamycin preparations that are taken by mouth include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). Oral suspension is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, due to its extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment. Several combination acne treatments containing clindamycin are also marketed, such as single-product formulations of clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide—sold as BenzaClin (Sanofi-Aventis), Duac (a gel form made by Stiefel), and Acanya, among other trade names—and, in the United States, a combination of clindamycin and tretinoin, sold as Ziana. In India, vaginal suppositories containing clindamycin in combination with clotrimazole are manufactured by Olive Health Care and sold as Clinsup-V. In Egypt, vaginal cream containing clindamycin produced by Biopharmgroup sold as Vagiclind indicated for vaginosis. Clindamycin is available as a generic drug, for both systemic (oral and intravenous) and topical use. (The exception is the vaginal suppository, which is not available as a generic in the US). == Veterinary use == The veterinary uses of clindamycin are quite similar to its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, for which it is the preferred drug in dogs and cats. They can be used both by mouth and topically. A disadvantage is that bacterial resistance can develop fairly quickly. Gastrointestinal upset may also occur. Toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT04370548 for ""DARE-BV1 in the Treatment of Bacterial Vaginosis (DARE-BVFREE)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov"	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}

It was found that there were ginsenoside-Rd (G-Rd), ginsenoside-F2 (G-F2), compound K (CK) and 20(S) protopanaxadiol (Ppd) metabolites beside the prodrug G-Rb1 induced by fungi (No. 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9). The six strains of fungi have different degrees of ability to metabolize G-Rb1 and PDS. The possible metabolic process could be as follows: G-Rb1 (or PDS)-->G-Rd-->G-F2-->CK-->Ppd.

The cellular location of HDE was determined by subcellular fractionation followed by Western blot analysis of peroxisomal and cytosolic fractions using antiserum specific for HDE. HDE was found to be exclusively targeted to and imported into peroxisomes in both heterologous expression systems. Deletion and mutational analyses were used to determine the regions within HDE which are essential for its targeting to peroxisomes. Deletion of a carboxyl-terminal tripeptide Ala-Lys-Ile completely abolished targeting of HDE to peroxisomes, whereas large internal deletions of HDE (amino acids 38-353 or 395-731) had no effect on HDE targeting to peroxisomes in either yeast. This tripeptide is similar to, but distinct from, other tripeptide peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTSs) as identified in peroxisomal firefly luciferase and four mammalian peroxisomal proteins. Substitutions within the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide (Ala----Gly and Lys----Gln) supported targeting of HDE to peroxisomes of C. albicans but not of S. cerevisiae. This is the first detailed analysis of the peroxisomal targeting signal in a yeast peroxisomal protein. The substrate specificities of porcine and bovine enteropeptidases were investigated using the peptide Val-(Asp)(4)-Lys-Ile-Val-Gly and its various analogs with mutations in the (Asp)(4)-Lys sequence as substrates. The results indicated that in addition to P1 Lys, P2 Asp in the substrates is most important, that P3 Asp is additionally important, and that P5 Asp contributes somewhat to the susceptibility, and that P4 Asp is the least important. These results were essentially identical as between porcine and bovine enteropeptidases.	MEDICAL, FOOD	INFO	{'INFO': -2.057744e-05}
367	H-tyr-ile-oh	PUBMED	 Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly used to monitor biological functions of specific targets in small animals (1-4). However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–650 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (650–1,000 nm) detection avoids the natural background fluorescence interference of biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues in small animals. NIR fluorophores have a wider dynamic range and minimal background fluorescence as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. NIR fluorophores also have high sensitivity, attributable to low background fluorescence, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is a noninvasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals (4, 5). Extracellular matrix adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans that surround connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (6). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play a role in inflammation and atherogenesis, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (7). A meshwork of clotted plasma protein was present in the tumor stroma but not in normal tissues, providing a functional matrix for angiogenesis, cell migration, and tumor cell invasion (8). There are high levels of collagens, fibronectin, and fibrin in the tumor connective tissues. Thrombosis plays a major role in many cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and cerebral venous thrombosis (9). Thrombosis occurs by an activation process of thrombin (F2 coagulation factor II), which then converts fibrinogen into fibrin. Thrombin initiates the cross-linking of the polymerized fibrin  The central administration of neurotensin (NT) or of its C-terminal hexapeptide fragment NT(8-13), produces strong analgesic effects in tests evaluating acute pain. The use of NT-derived peptides as pharmaceutical agents to relief severe pain in patients could be of great interest. Unfortunately, peptides do not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. We have observed that the cyclic NT(8-13) analogue, c(Lys-Lys-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu-Lys-Lys-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu) (JMV2012, compound 1), when peripherally administered to mice produced analgesic and hypothermic effects, suggesting the peptide penetrates the blood-brain barrier and functions effectively like a drug. Moreover, dimeric compounds show increased potency compared to their corresponding monomer. We present the synthesis of the cyclic dimer compound 1 (JMV2012). In mice, compound 1 induced a profound hypothermia and a potent analgesia, even when peripherally administered. Compound 1 appears to be an ideal lead compound for the development of bioactive NT analogues as novel analgesics drugs. The synthetic peptides Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr and Gly-Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg-Tyr, which contain Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR), the ligands for two important classes of cell adhesion receptors, were covalently coupled to a nonadhesive modified glass surface by the N-terminal Gly. The N-terminal Gly served as a spacer, and the C-terminal Y served as a site for radioiodination. These modified substrates supported the adhesion and spreading of cultured human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) independently of adsorbed proteins and, it was demonstrated that a covalently immobilized YIGSR-containing peptide has biological activity. The surface concentration of grafted peptide on the glass was measured by 125I radio-labeling and was 12.1 pmol/cm2. HFFs spread on both immobilized peptide substrates, but at much slower rates on grafted YIGSR glass surfaces than on the RGD-containing substrates. Cells formed focal contacts on the RGD-derivatized substrates in the presence or absence of serum. Focal contacts formed on the YIGSR-grafted surfaces only when serum was present in the medium and had morphologies different from those observed on the RGD-containing substrates. Serum influenced the organization of microfilaments and the extent of spreading of adherent cells, although adsorption of adhesion proteins was minimal on all substrates. This derivatization method produced chemically stable substrates which may be useful in studying receptor-mediated cell adhesion, as the quantity of peptide available at the surface may be precisely measured and controlled.

368	H-pro-ile-oh	PUBMED	 Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) may be exploited to maintain the incretin effect during the postprandial phase. As a result, glycemic regulation and energy homeostasis may be improved. Food protein-derived peptides have been identified as natural agents capable of inhibiting DPP-IV. Ile-Pro-Ile is the most potent DPP-IV inhibitory peptide identified to date. A minimum analog peptide set approach was used to study peptide analogs of Ile-Pro-Ile. The DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC We have found recently that membrane-bound dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) generated extracellularly immunoreactive endomorphin-2 from Tyr-Pro precursor in a depolarisation-sensitive manner in rat isolated L4,5 dorsal root ganglia when the enzyme was switched to synthase mode by the hydrolase inhibitor Ile-Pro-Ile. Presently, we induced hyperalgesia in rats by injecting carrageenan into the right hindpaw and measured the reduction in nociceptive threshold (hyperalgesia) to pressure (Randall-Selitto test). The hyperalgesia, peaking at 180 min after injection, was fully reversed by intrathecal administration of 30 nmol/rat Ile-Pro-Ile. The antihyperalgesic action was antagonized by s.c. naloxone (1 mg/kg) and intrathecally injected specific antiserum to endomorphin-2 indicating that the opioid receptor-mediated effect was produced by an endogenously generated endomorphin-2-like immunoreactive substance. Intrathecal Ile-Pro-Ile was ineffective as an analgesic in the acute nociceptive test such as the rat tail-flick, whereas endomorphin-2 (EC(50)=13.3 nmol/rat), endomorphin-1 (6.8 nmol/rat), morphine (0.11 nmol/rat) and DAMGO (0.0059 nmol/rat) exerted opioid receptor-mediated analgesia given by the same route. We concluded that carrageenan-induced C-fiber barrage (wind-up) may create ideal conditions for the de novo synthesis of endomorphin-2 in rat spinal cord dorsal horns if the DPP-IV enzyme is switched to the synthase functional mode by Ile-Pro-Ile. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV preferably hydrolyzes peptides and proteins with a penultimate proline residue. Umezawa and co-workers (Umezawa et al. (1984) J. Antibiotics 37, 422-425) reported that diprotin A (Ile-Pro-Ile) and diprotin B (Val-Pro-Leu) are inhibitors for dipeptidyl peptidase IV. We could show that both compounds as well as other tripeptides with a penultimate proline residue are substrates for dipeptidyl peptidase IV. An apparent competitive inhibition by those compounds is a kinetic artifact due to the substrate-like structure of such tripeptides.

371	Isoleucyl-proline	PUBMED	 Isoleucine-proline-proline (Ile-Pro-Pro, IPP) is a natural food source tripeptide that inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. The aim of this study was to determine the central and peripheral roles of IPP in attenuating sympathetic activity, oxidative stress and hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sham-operated surgery (Sham) or two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) surgery to induce renovascular hypertension. Renal sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure were recorded. Bilateral microinjections of IPP to hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) attenuated sympathetic activity (-16.1 ± 2.5%, P < 0.001) and hypertension (-8.7 ± 1.5 mmHg, P < 0.01) in 2K1C rats by inhibiting ACE activity and subsequent angiotensin II and superoxide production in the PVN. Intravenous injections of IPP also attenuated sympathetic activity (-15.1 ± 2.1%, P < 0.001) and hypertension (-16.8 ± 2.3 mmHg, P < 0.001) via inhibiting ACE activity and oxidative stress in both PVN and arteries of 2K1C rats. The duration of the effects of the intravenous IPP was longer than those of the PVN microinjection, but the sympatho-inhibitory effect of intravenous injections occurred later than that of the PVN microinjection. Intraperitoneal injection of IPP (400 pmol/day for 20 days) attenuated hypertension and vascular remodeling via inhibiting ACE activity and oxidative stress in both PVN and arteries of 2K1C rats. These results indicate that IPP attenuates hypertension and sympathetic activity by inhibiting ACE activity and oxidative stress. The sympathoinhibitory effect of peripheral IPP is mainly caused by the ACE inhibition in PVN, and the antihypertensive effect is related to the sympathoinhibition and the arterial ACE inhibition. Long-term intraperitoneal IPP therapy attenuates hypertension, oxidative stress and vascular remodeling. The objective of this study was to explore the molecular targets and mechanism of Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) on regulating glucose metabolism in hepatic cells and their in vivo hypoglycemic activities in mice. Results showed that both IPP and VPP (600 μM) significantly enhanced the glucose consumption in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes ( Much clinical evidence on the antihypertensive effects of the milk-derived antihypertensive peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (lactotripeptides) has been reported. However, circadian rhythm effects determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to eliminate the confounding influence of the white-coat effect have not been fully studied. Twelve hypertensive patients not receiving antihypertensive medication (2 men, 10 women; mean age±standard deviation, 63.5±8.3 years) who had been visiting our clinic for more than 1 year participated in this study. Mean (±standard deviation) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 142.4±2.6 and 83.5±6.4 mm Hg, respectively, at the first office visit. After patients ingested a fermented milk product containing antihypertensive peptides (2.53 mg Val-Pro-Pro; 1.52 mg Ile-Pro-Pro) for more than 4 weeks, both office SBP and DBP were significantly reduced to a mean (±standard deviation) of 133.3±7.0 mm Hg and 76.5±8.4 mm Hg (P<.001 and P<.005 by paired t-test), respectively. The 24-hour SBP and DBP determined by ABPM were reduced from 127.3±2.4 and 78.7±2.3 mm Hg to 120.2±2.4 and 75.0±2.2 mm Hg (P<.001 and P<.05), respectively. Awake-time SBP (08:00-21:00), night-time SBP (0:00-05:00), and early-morning SBP (06:00-07:00) were reduced from 130.9±2.4 to 123.3±2.3 mm Hg, 118.7±2.9 to 113.2±3.4 mm Hg, and 132.8±4.3 to 122.4±3.9 mm Hg (by paired t-test: P<.001, P<.05, and P<.05), respectively. As seen with DBP measured by ABPM, 24-hour DBP and awake-time DBP were significantly reduced from 78.7±2.3 to 75.0±2.2 mm Hg and 82.1±2.5 to 77.3±2.2 mm Hg (P<.05 and P<.01), respectively. Office BP and 24-hour blood pressure did not significantly differ between the dipper and nondipper groups at baseline. However, after treatment, night-time and early-morning blood pressure were significantly reduced from baseline in the nondipper group (-8.5±2.5 and -15.6±3.7 mm Hg; P<.05 and P<.01, respectively) but not in the dipper group (-2.5±3.6 and -1.2±4.7 mm Hg; P not significant), and the reduction in early-morning blood pressure significantly differed between the groups (P<.05). These results suggest that Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro decrease blood pressure in patients with stage I hypertension and result not only in lower blood pressure at night-time but also in lower early-morning SBP in nondipper patients.

376	Isoleucyl-l-tyrosine	PUBMED	 Catecholamine synthesis and transmission in the brain are influenced by the availability of Tyr in the body. In this study, we compared the effects of oral administration of Tyr-containing dipeptides Ile-Tyr, Ser-Tyr, and Tyr-Pro with Tyr alone on catecholamine metabolism in the mouse brainstem. Among these dipeptides, Ile-Tyr administration led to increases in dopamine, the dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, compared to administration of Ser-Tyr, Tyr-Pro, or Tyr alone. In comparison, administration of Ser-Tyr induced significantly increasing noradrenaline turnover, while Tyr-Pro administration suppressed dopamine turnover. Therefore, oral administration of Ile-Tyr, Ser-Tyr, and Tyr-Pro differentially affected metabolism of dopamine and noradrenaline. These observations strongly suggest that Tyr-containing dipeptides exert distinct effects on catecholamine metabolism in the brainstem when ingested orally. beta-(Tyr9)melanotropin-(9-18), which itself has no analgesic action, as measured by the tail-flick and hot-plate methods, decreased morphine-induced analgesia following intracerebroventricular injection. H-Phe-Ile-Tyr-His-Ser-Tyr-Lys-OH heptapeptide, which has weak CRF-like activity, had no action on analgesia and was not able to modify morphine-induced analgesia. Compared with ACTH1-24, which in a subcutaneous dose of 100 micrograms/rat decreased morphine-induced analgesia, the same dose of H-Phe-Ile-Tyr-His-Ser-Tyr-Lys-OH was ineffective. The action of H-Phe-Ile-Tyr-His-Ser-Tyr-Lys-OH on the passive and active avoidance behavior and open-field activity of rats was studied after peripheral and intracerebroventricular administration. When applied before the test session, intracerebroventricular administration increased the avoidance latency of passive avoidance behavior. Subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intracerebroventricular administration of the peptide delayed the extinction of active avoidance behavior. Both subcutaneous and intracerebroventricular administration increased the grooming activity of the rats. The data suggest that H-Phe-Ile-Tyr-His-Ser-Tyr-Lys-OH is able to influence memory, acting mainly on the retrieval processes, and to modify open-field activity.

MRI has shown promise in thrombus detection in both animals and humans (4), such as direct thrombus imaging based on the T Conformational analysis of peptide 1, H-Leu-Leu-Ile-Leu-OMe on complexing with macro cycle calix[8]arene has been carried out using (1)H-NMR and FTIR spectroscopic techniques. Stoichiometry of the complex formed in the 1:8 ratio was evidenced by a Job plot. NMR studies of the above peptide show a marked downfield shift and an increase in (3)J values for NH resonances on complexing with calix[8]arene. The characteristic NOE connectivity between N(i+1)H and C(ialpha)H confirm beta-sheet conformation in the complexed state. Both (1)H-NMR and FTIR results indicate that the alpha-amino group of Leu I is proximal to the macrocycle and is involved in hydrogen bond formation with phenolic hydrogen atom of the calix[8]arene. This suggests that calix[8]arene provides a suitable platform for peptide 1 to self-assemble in a parallel beta-sheet conformation. The nature of calix[8]arene interaction with peptide 1 has been studied using dynamic NMR studies, which concludes that a bifurcated hydrogen bonding interaction exists in the molecular interfaces of the assembly. The protruding domain (P-domain) of the murine norovirus (MNV) capsid protein VP1 is essential for infection. It mediates receptor binding and attachment of neutralizing antibodies. Protein NMR studies into interactions of the P-domain with ligands will yield insights not easily available from other biophysical techniques and will extend our understanding of MNV attachment to host cells.

405	H-met-leu-oh	PUBMED	" NAD Selective immunocytochemical procedures, applied at the light and electron microscopical level, have resulted in the identification of three types of enkephalin-immunoreactive nerves in the feline gastrointestinal tract, including neurons containing either Met- or Leu-enkephalin immunoreactivity or those simultaneously storing both Met- and Leu-enkephalin immunoreactants. The three different types of enkephalin nerves show a similar distribution in the gut with the exception of the small arteries which frequently appear to be innervated only by Met-enkephalin-immunoreactive terminals. Electron microscopical identification using optimally fixed, osmicated, and contrasted tissue revealed ultrastructural differences between the three types of nerve terminals. Thus, the terminals contained variable proportions of large granular and large opaque p-type vesicles. Large granular vesicles were associated predominantly with Met-enkephalin immunoreactions. It is presently impossible to decide whether the different p-type vesicles reflect a continuous processing of a precursor contained within them or whether they are truly different in peptide content. Thus, granular vesicles had cores of either high or medium electron density. Medium electron-dense granular vesicles were sometimes difficult to distinguish from large opaque vesicles suggesting the existence of possible transitional forms. All types of enkephalin terminals also contained small clear (""cholinergic-like"") vesicles which were not immunoreactive to enkephalins. These data indicate that multiple enkephalin precursors/enkephalin-containing peptides occur in the gut or, alternatively or additionally, that a common Met/Leu-enkephalin precursor is processed differently in different neurons. N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), a mimic of N-formyl oligopeptides that are released from bacteria, is a potent leukocyte chemotactic factor. It induces intracellular calcium ([Ca]i) transient that is important for various neutrophil biological functions, e.g., adhesion, ROS, and cytokine productions. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), an essential part of host innate immunity, regulate neutrophil activities, but their role in [Ca]i signaling is less clear. In the present study, we examined the effect of several TLR ligands, including Pam3Cys4 (TLR1/2), lipopolysaccharide (LPS, TLR4), and lipoteichoic acid (LTA, TLR2/6), on calcium signaling and on the fMLP-induced [Ca]i transients in mouse neutrophils loaded with Fura-2/AM. We found that unlike fMLP, the three TLR ligands tested did not elicit any detectable Ca flux. However, Pam3Cys4, but not LPS or LTA, markedly synergized the fMLP-induced [Ca]i transients, and had no effect on the host component keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC)- or C5a-induced calcium flux. The effect of Pam3Cys4 on the fMLP-induced [Ca]i transients is by enhancing extracellular Ca influx, not intracellular Ca release. Surprisingly, deletion of TLR2 or MyD88 in neutrophils had no impact on the Pam3Cys4's effect, suggesting a TLR2-MyD88-independent mechanism. Finally, using the pan PKC activator and inhibitor, we demonstrated that PKC negatively regulated fMLP-induced [Ca]i transients and that inhibition of PKC did not prohibit Pam3Cys4's synergistic effect on the fMLP-induced calcium influx. In conclusion, the present study identified a novel synergistic effect of Pam3Cys4 on fMLP-induced [Ca]i transients, a process important for many neutrophil biological functions."

407	H-val-leu-oh	PUBMED	 Ethanolic gastric mucosal impairment is one of the most common disorders in the gastrointestinal system. In this study, we investigated the potential alleviating effects of sea cucumber peptides on Ges-1 impairment caused by ethanol and the associated mechanisms. The sea cucumber peptide VLLY could promote the proliferation and migration of healthy Ges-1 cells. After ethanol injury, VLLY peptide treatment could greatly promote the migration of Ges-1 cells, scavenge intracellular and mitochondrial ROS, reverse mitochondrial fission and F-actin depolymerization, and improve mitochondrial respiration. VLLY peptide restored mitochondrial dynamics by downregulating Drp1 and Fis1 and upregulating Mfn2 against excessive mitochondrial fission. In addition, the VLLY peptide maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential, ablated the leakage of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm, upregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-XL, decreased the expression of the proapoptotic factors of Bax, BAD, and cleaved caspase-3, and finally blocked the mitochondria-related apoptotic pathway. These findings strongly suggested that sea cucumber peptides could promote proliferation and migration of healthy Ges-1 cells and reverse ethanol-induced excess mitochondrial fission and maintain mitochondrial homeostasis through the Fis1/Bax pathway, thereby improving ethanol-induced apoptosis. VLLY offers a new perspective for improving the ethanolic gastric mucosal epithelial cell injury. Bifidobacterium species are known to fulfill important functions within the human colon. Thus, stimulating the activity of bifidobacteria is important to maintain host health. We revealed that culture supernatants of Bacillus subtilis C-3102 (referred to as C-3102) stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium species. In this study, we isolated and identified six bifidogenic growth factors, which were cyclo (D-Val-D-Ile), cyclo (L-Val-D-Ile), cyclo (D-Val-L-Ile), cyclo (L-Val-L-Ile), cyclo (D-Val-L-Leu) and cyclo (L-Val-L-Leu). These six cyclic dipeptides increased the growth of Bifidobacterium species and had no effect on potentially harmful gut organisms. Moreover, supplementation with a mixture of these six cyclic dipeptides significantly increased the abundance of microorganisms related to the genus Bifidobacterium in a human colonic microbiota model culture system, although supplementation with a single type of dipeptide had no effect. These results show that cyclic dipeptides containing Val-Leu and Val-Ile produced by C-3102 could serve as bifidogenic growth factors in the gut microbial community. Kokumi is a beneficial feeling for the evaluation of food quality, and thus, preparing and understanding the taste properties of kokumi compounds are important for the flavor of food. N-acetyl-Val/Leu/Ile/Met/Phe/Trp/Tyr is a type of kokumi compound found in food and usually prepared by chemical reagents. In this study, we first prepared these six kokumi compounds using transglutaminase and protease A2SD in aqueous solution by using amino acids and acetic acid as substrates and evaluated their kokumi characteristics. HPLC and LC-MS were used to identify quantitative N-acetyl amino acids. Using Phe and acetic acid as substrates, transglutaminase and protease A2SD showed the highest yields for N-acetyl-Phe of 22.75 and 42.21%, respectively, under the optimal conditions. For N-acetyl-Val/Leu/Ile/Met/Trp/Tyr, these two enzymes showed the synthesis yield in the ranges of 2.22-20.12 and 0.75-12.91%, respectively. Six N-acetyl-amino acids were succesully enriched by ethyl acetate with a recovery over 50% and purity over 95%. Sensory evaluation found that N-acetyl-Val/Leu/Ile/Met/Phe are kokumi compounds that enhance sweet, umami, and salt tastes in 5% sucrose, 0.3% NaCl, and 0.5% sodium glutamate, especially N-acetyl-Val, with the salt- and umami-enhancing threshold values of 0.63 and 1.25 g/L, respectively. Therefore, transglutaminase and protease A2SD for the synthesis of partial N-acetyl amino acid might have the potential to be applied in food as a kokumi compound.

PDT has become a promising modality to treat skin, esophagus, and lung cancers, as well as other diseases such as atherosclerosis, macular degeneration, and rheumatoid arthritis (2). In PDT, light excites the singlet state of the PS, followed by intersystem transition from the singlet state to the triplet state; then, the energy is transferred from the triplet state of the PS to the triplet ground state of oxygen, 	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -5.8961017e-05}
411	Leucylproline	PUBMED	 A sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay has been developed for the determination of L-6-keto-piperidine-2-carbonyl-L-leucyl-L-proline amide (RGH-2202), a new analog of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), in plasma. An antiserum was produced in guinea pigs immunized with RGH-2202 which was conjugated to bovine serum albumin by an N-succinimidyl ester method. Iodine-125 labeled L-6-keto-piperidine-2-carbonyl-L-leucyl-L-prolyltyramine [( 125I]RGH-2202) was used as a tracer. Polyethylene glycol was used to separate bound and free [125I]RGH-2202 in the reaction mixture. The assay of RGH-2202 in plasma was possible over a concentration range from 0.1 to 6.4 ng/ml, using 0.1 ml of plasma without the need for an extraction procedure. The antiserum used for the assay was highly specific for RGH-2202, and did not cross-react with TRH and the hydrolyzed derivatives of RGH-2202 such as L-6-keto-piperidine-2-carbonyl-L-leucyl-L-proline, L-6-keto-piperidine-2-carbonyl-L-leucine and L-leucyl-L-proline amide, which were assumed to be present in plasma as metabolites. The coefficients of variation were 4.6-6.7% for within-assay and 6.0-8.8% for between-assay. Plasma levels of RGH-2202 in rats were determined after an intravenous administration of RGH-2202 at a pharmacologically effective dose (0.625 mg/kg). Psychopharmacological activities of L-6-ketopiperidine-2-carbonyl-L-leucyl-L-proline amide (RGH-2202) were compared with those of the parent peptide, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH, L-pyroglutamyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide, Pyr-His-Pro amide) in rodents. RGH-2202 caused qualitatively similar effects to TRH in a variety of tests for the activity on the central nervous system. The compound as well as TRH increased the spontaneous motor activity, enhanced the conditioned avoidance response, and antagonized the avoidance suppression by haloperidol and the sleep-inducing effect of pentorbarbital in mice. It was also efficacious against the deficits of consciousness in mice with concussive head injury and the EEG disturbance in rats with basilar artery occlusion. Besides, it antagonized the cycloheximide-or anoxia-induced amnesia and enhanced the habituation of exploratory activity in mice. Biochemically, it enhanced, like TRH, the turnover of norepinephrine and dopamine in the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum of mice and rats, and increased cyclic GMP levels in the cerebellum of rats. In spite of the global similarity between the pharmacological profiles of RGH-2202 and TRH, there were some intriguing differences between them. RGH-2202 was 2-5 times more effective than TRH in improving the deficits of active avoidance performance and retention in mice, while it was weaker than TRH in modifying the haloperidol-induced catalepsy in mice and enhancing the spinal reflexes in rats. Besides, its thyrotropin releasing activity was about 30 times less potent than that of TRH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) A memory deficit model has been developed following bilateral internal capsule lesions in rats. During 12-49 days after internal capsule lesions, the rats showed a marked impairment of active avoidance acquisition in a step-through apparatus, while they exhibited no observable change in native behaviors, except a slight increase in exploratory activity. A passive avoidance task in the same apparatus was also impaired in internal capsule lesioned rats when examined after one-trial training, though the task was gradually acquired by repeated trainings. Moreover, the retention of both the active and passive avoidance responses in well-trained rats deteriorated after internal capsule lesions. On the other hand, internal capsule-lesioned rats did not perform any worse than sham-operated rats in a T-maze spontaneous alternation behavior and in a habituation response to a novel environment. In the frontal cortex and striatum of internal capsule-lesioned rats, there was a significant decrease of dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites, but no change of acetylcholine levels. The acquisition deficit of active avoidance in internal capsule-lesioned rats was improved by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and L-6-ketopiperidine-2-carbonyl-L-leucyl-L-proline amide (RGH-2202, 10 mg/kg, i.p., 0.2 and 1 mg/kg i.v.), but not by physostigmine sulfate (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.). These results indicate that bilateral internal capsule lesions in rats induce long-term memory deficits which are paralleled with a decrease of the contents of monoamines and their metabolites and improved by TRH and RGH-2202.

The long-term fermentation endows dry-cured hams with a unique flavor and quality. Our previous study has identified Asp-Leu-Glu-Glu (DLEE) from dry-cured Xuanwei ham with remarkable antioxidant capacity. In the current study, the Caco-2 cells were cultured in vitro and treated with different doses of DLEE. The cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and antioxidant enzyme activities were then determined to investigate the intracellular protection effect of DLEE. According to the results, the cellular ROS level was reduced, whereas the antioxidant enzyme activities of glutathione reductase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were improved following DLEE treatment. The DLEE treatment also increased the Nrf2 expression, along with downregulating the Keap1 expression. Thus, the dry-cured ham-derived peptide DLEE exhibited excellent bioactive capacity by reducing the ROS level and regulating the antioxidant enzyme activities. In addition, Nrf2/Keap1 was shown to be the main signaling pathway underlying DLEE-induced antioxidant activities in Caco-2 cells.	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -0.008411501, 'OD': 0.0}

FPR1 is highly expressed on neutrophils under inflammatory conditions for their emigration to the sites of injury and infection (2). However, collateral damage may occur, which can cause pain, edema, fever, and swelling. The peptide antagonist cinnamoyl-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-Lys-NH Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) maps information about tissues spatially and functionally. Protons (hydrogen nuclei) are widely used in imaging because of their abundance in water molecules. Water comprises ~80% of most soft tissue. The contrast of proton MRI depends primarily on the density of the nucleus (proton spins), the relaxation times of the nuclear magnetization (T1, longitudinal; T2, transverse), the magnetic environment of the tissues, and the blood flow to the tissues. However, insufficient contrast between normal and diseased tissues requires the development of contrast agents. Most contrast agents affect the T1 and T2 relaxation times of the surrounding nuclei, mainly the protons of water. T2* is the spin–spin relaxation time composed of variations from molecular interactions and intrinsic magnetic heterogeneities of tissues in the magnetic field (1). Cross-linked iron oxide nanoparticles and other iron oxide formulations affect T2 primarily and lead to decreased signals.

The aminium N-H⋯Cl⋯H-N bridging extensions give rise to zigzag chains extending along the a axis, the overall two-dimensional structure lying in the (110) plane. Lysosomes are degradative organelles essential for cell homeostasis. However, various internal and external stimuli, including L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe), which is one of the common lysosomotropic agents, permeabilize the lysosomal membrane, leading to lysosome-dependent cell death because of leakage of lysosomal contents to the cytosol. The microphthalmia/transcription factor E (MiT/TFE) family members, which include transcription factor EB (TFEB), transcription factor E3 (TFE3), and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), are master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis and are known to be involved in the lysosomal stress response. However, their protective effects against cell death associated with lysosomal-membrane damage are still poorly understood. In this study, we confirmed that LLOMe-induced lysosomal damage triggered nuclear translocation of TFEB/TFE3/MITF and increased the mRNA levels of their target genes encoding lysosomal hydrolases and lysosomal membrane proteins in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we revealed that TFEB/TFE3/MITF knockdown exacerbated LLOMe-induced cell death. However, TFEB overexpression only slightly attenuated LLOMe-induced cell death, despite enhanced LLOMe-induced increase in CTSD mRNA levels, implying that the endogenous levels of MiT/TFE family members might be sufficient to promote lysosomal biogenesis in response to lysosomal-membrane damage. Our results suggest that MiT/TFE family members suppress the cell death associated with lysosomal-membrane damage.

418	H-leu-val-oh	PUBMED	 The dipeptide L-Leu-L-Val can crystallize as a hydrate in the hexagonal space group P6(5) [Görbitz & Gundersen (1996). Acta Chem. Scand. 50, 537-543], but forms 1:1 solvates when methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol are used as precipitating agents. The structures of these complexes can be divided into hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers. The alcohol molecules are embedded in the hydrophobic layers, but with the hydroxyl groups as crucial parts of the hydrogen-bonding network. L-Leucyl-L-valine-methanol (1/1) crystallizes in the space group P2(1) with Z = 2. L-Leucyl-L-valine-ethanol (1/1) has very special systematic absences, and the structure could not be solved with direct methods. Unraveling the actual build-up of the crystal was an unusual process involving modeling with molecular graphics programs. The solution shows a structure which formally belongs to the space group P2(1), with four dipeptide molecules and four solvent molecules in the asymmetric unit (Z = 8). Additional non-crystallographic symmetry in three dimensions fixes all cell angles, including beta, to 90 degrees. L-Leucyl-L-valine-2-propanol (1/1) is structurally closely related to the ethanol solvate, but owing to a rare type of packing disorder the length of the a axis is halved (Z = 4, P2(1)2(1)2(1)). The hydrogen-bonding pattern is still the same as in the ethanol solvate, which means that the hydrogen-bond periodicity along the a axis in the 2-propanol solvate is two unit-cell lengths.

From June 2017 to June 2019, 104 FV-PTC patients (106 nodules) and 337 classic papillary thyroid carcinoma (C-PTC) patients (343 nodules) with both sonograms and pathologic results were included. Sonographic features of FV-PTC and C-PTC were evaluated and compared, and 2017 ACR TI-RADS scores and levels were calculated. Pathologically, the incidence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and extrathyroidal extension was higher in the FV-PTC group. Most of both the FV-PTC and C-PTC groups were diagnosed as PTC or suspicious PTC by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). FV-PTC tended to be isoechoic, while most nodules of C-PTC were hypoechoic or very hypoechoic. Compared with C-PTC, FV-PTC had lower percentages of a taller-than-wide shape (11.3% vs. 46.6%) and lobulated or irregular margin (33.0% vs. 61.8%), and a higher percentage of extrathyroidal extension (20.8% vs. 8.2%). FV-PTC featured macrocalcifications, whereas punctate echogenic foci were more frequently seen in the C-PTC group. Other characteristic US appearances of FV-PTC included uneven hypoechoic halo and peripheral vascularity. The mean TI-RADS score of FV-PTC cases was lower in the FV-PTC group, 11.3%, 44.3%, and 42.5% of which were categorized as TI-RADS 3, 4, and 5, respectively. FV-PTC features isoechoic appearance, macrocalcifications, uneven hypoechoic halo, and peripheral vascularity on US, with lower incidences of microcalcifications and taller-than-wide shape, and tends to have lower TI-RADS scores and levels. For the nodules categorized as TI-RADS 3 or 4, the FNAB criteria should be broaden when these nodules have FV-PTC US features.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': 0.0}

The State of Finland sold its share of 15 per cent to Valmet. In mid-July, the Swedish company Alfa Laval made an offer to buy Neles. Valmet's CEO Laine rebuked the board of Neles for ill-advised actions and accepting a price that was too low. Laine had previously managed the business operations of Neles and thought that Valmet could in time have bought more of its stock. Alfa Laval's CEO said that they had bought Neles at a “pandemic discount,” and the front page of the Swedish financial newspaper Dagens Industri celebrated that Sweden would soon own Finland's industry. Valmet started buying Neles stock. By the autumn, Valmet owned nearly 30 per cent of the stock. Alfa Laval only received the support of a third of Neles owners for its takeover bid, and withdrew from the competition in November. In January 2021, Valmet reported that it would supply the mills of the Swedish company Renewcell with equipment to produce dissolving pulp from recycled clothes and textiles. In May, Valmet announced that it would deliver drying technology to Spinnova, which produces textile fiber from cellulose. Valmet equipment for the textile industry is in high demand in Europe, because the collection of discarded textiles for recycling must be organized in the EU countries by 2025. Valmet had been developing recycling technology with Renewcell for years, and the companies constructed a pilot plant and a factory in Sundsvall together. In July 2021, Valmet and Neles agreed to merge. Neles owners obtained 18.8 per cent of the merging company. The companies’ synergies were considered to be substantial during the transaction. Neles was thought to help increase sales in automation systems, while its products were also to be sold to the paper industry. Neles merged into Valmet in April 2022, becoming Valmet's fifth business line, Flow Control. The companies had several managers and employees who knew each other from Metso days. After the merger, the company had 17,000 employees, 3,000 of whom came from Neles. In February 2024, it was announced that President and CEO Pasi Laine would be retiring at the end of September 2024. Danish CEO of Mediq, Thomas Hinnerskov, was chosen by Valmet's board of directors to lead the company as the new President and CEO.

430	H-met-val-oh	PUBMED	 The Val158Met polymorphism of human catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) is one of the most well-studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms in neuropsychiatry; however, findings are inconsistent due to human genetic heterogeneity. We created the first 'humanized' COMTVal158Met mouse lines, which carry either human COMT Val or Met alleles via gene targeting. The 'humanized' mouse model enables strict comparison of the physiological functions of the two alleles. Consistent with human observation, Met/Met mice exhibited a 30% reduction in enzymatic activity compared with Val/Val mice. On the basis of the reported differences in human Met and Val carriers across working memory, fear processes and sensorimotor gating, we examined these functions between sibling Met/Met and Val/Val mice. Val/Val mice exhibited robust reductions in spatial working memory compared with Met/Met mice in both sexes, with tolcapone treatment significantly reversing the Val/Val alternation deficits. Sex effects were observed in other behaviors, with male Val/Val mice exhibited lower prepulse inhibition compared with Met/Met mice, whereas female mice exhibited the opposite phenotype. Female but not male Met/Met mice exhibited reduced contextual fear, increased cued fear, and reduced extinction recall. Thus, these mice (1) support the argument that human COMT Val158Met polymorphism modulates behavioral functions and most importantly (2) exhibit the expected treatment effects supporting the 'inverted U shaped' dose response of catecholamine signaling on cognitive function. This model will be invaluable for understanding the effects of human COMT Val158Met polymorphism on cortical development and behavioral functions, and how this polymorphism modulates treatment response. Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. In this disease, genetic and environmental factors are involved. In Alzheimer's, changes of nucleotide 196 (G> A) or valine polymorphism of 66-methionine in the BDNF gene is a risk factor for brain-derived neurogenic factors. In China, this polymorphism has not been studied in Alzheimer's patients and perhaps this study could provide appropriate information on the prognosis and susceptibility of the disease. Therefore, in this case-control study, 73 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 100 patients as a healthy control group were studied. Blood samples were taken from the mentioned individuals and DNA was extracted. After quantitative and qualitative DNA analysis, a PCR-RFLP test was performed and the results of both groups were compared. The results showed that 14 patients and 7 people in the control group had BDNF gene polymorphism. In the patient group, the number of people with normal allele was 59. Heterozygous people were 8 and people with methionine/methionine alleles were 6. In the control group, 93 normal individuals, 5 heterozygous individuals, and 2 people had methionine/methionine alleles. In general, increasing the accumulation of valine/methionine polymorphism of the BDNF gene in Alzheimer's patients compared to control can indicate the role of this polymorphism. Clinically, patients with this polymorphism had a more unfavorable clinical condition compared to patients without it. Therefore, evaluation of the presence of this polymorphism can provide appropriate information about the disease status. This study was conducted to discover the effectiveness of dietary peptides (γ-[Glu](n=1,2)-Phe/-Met/-Val) as stimulators of cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion. The kokumi-active γ-[Glu](n=1,2)-Phe/-Met/-Val at concentrations of 2.5-10 mM would trigger the release of CCK and GLP-1 by activating the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). The CaSR-mediated Ca2+/CaM/CaMK pathway was proposed in γ-[Glu](n=1,2)-Phe/-Met/-Val-induced CCK and GLP-1 secretion based on the following results: the exposure to γ-Glu-Phe increased the protein expression level (western blot analysis), the intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) mobilization in response to γ-[Glu](n=1,2)-Phe/-Met/-Val was strongly enhanced, and the inhibitors of signaling pathway proteins (NPS-2143, BAPTA-AM, and KN62) abolished partially γ-[Glu](n=1,2)-Phe/-Met/-Val-induced CCK and GLP-1 secretion.

432	Tyrosyl-valine	PUBMED	 The micelle formation of Tyr-Phe dipeptide and Val-Tyr-Val tripeptide has been studied for the first time. The aggregation numbers were determined for both the peptides in aqueous solution and in the presence of SDS and PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer additive environments. The results obtained by steady state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopic techniques are in good agreement with each other. The higher value of aggregation number confirms the formation of mixed micelles. The fluorescence lifetime of tyrosine in various micellar and mixed micellar systems were also determined. The decreased lifetime values with the quencher suggested the dynamic nature of the quenching process. However, the possibility of static quenching cannot be ruled out. The accessibility of DPC quencher was found to be more in dipeptide than tripeptide. The aggregation properties of Tyr-Phe dipeptide and Val-Tyr-Val tripeptide were studied in aqueous solution and in the presence of SDS and SDS-polymer environments using UV-visible, surface tension, fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) techniques. Both the peptides formed micelles. The cmc values obtained for dipeptide and tripeptide are 2×10(-5) and 4×10(-5) M, respectively in aqueous solution at 25°C. The presence of additives (SDS and polymer) hindered the micelle formation of peptides. The cmc values obtained by various methods are in good agreement with each other. Effect of peptides on the aggregation properties of SDS also was investigated. The cmc of SDS was decreased in presence of peptides and were reduced with increase in temperature. Using monophasic micellization concept, the association constant (K(A)) for the SDS-peptide mixed micellar systems was determined. Using biphasic model, the thermodynamic parameters viz; ΔG°(m), ΔH°(m) and ΔS°(m) for SDS-water and SDS-peptide-water mixed micellar systems, the standard free energy for transfer of SDS from aqueous to peptide additive environments were estimated at various temperatures. These results suggest that the SDS is more stable in micellized form in the SDS-water-peptide ternary systems compared to the situation in the corresponding SDS-water binary systems. It was found that substitution of Val2 and/or Leu4 residue in a hexapeptide Tyr-Val-Pro-Leu-Phe-Pro (I) transforms this peptide immunostimulant into analogues possessing the immunosuppressor activity--Tyr-Gly-Pro-Leu-Phe-Pro (II), Tyr-Val-Pro-Gly-Phe-Pro (III), and Tyr-Gly-Pro-Gly-Phe-Pro (IV). Biological effects of peptides I-IV were studied using PFC (plaque forming cell) test, GvH (graft vs host) reaction in mice, and ARFC (autologous rosette forming cell) test. The strongest immunosuppressor activity was observed for III--in this case the immunosuppressor effect was observed even in PFC test in vitro in which II and IV showed no such activity. These results suggest that simultaneous presence of both Val2 and Leu4 residues is necessary for the generation of immunostimulation. The CD study of I-IV in methanol solution suggests that the conformational preferences of II-IV change towards stabilization of the beta-turn structure, whereas in the case of I the gamma-turn on Leu4 and cis' orientation of the Pro3 carbonyl (distorted beta-turn of type I) was found as the preferred conformation. Competition in biological effects observed for I and III in PFC in vitro test suggests that these analogues may interact with the same cellular receptor. Drastic changes in the activity which accompany changes in the sequence are discussed in the terms of our stereochemical hypothesis.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.001025547}
436	H-val-phe-oh	PUBMED	 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease originating from the destruction of pancreatic β cells by autoreactive T cells (TCs) (1). In particular, islet-associated CD8 In this study, we evaluated the stability/bioavailability and in vivo antihypertensive activity of the tripeptide, Ala-Val-Phe, that was recently purified from insect protein (Spodoptera littoralis; Lepidoptera) and that showed in vitro angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. This tripeptide is partly hydrolyzed by mucosal peptidases to Val-Phe, a more potent in vitro ACE inhibitor. In organ bath experiments using rat aorta, Val-Phe showed ACE inhibition, while Ala-Val-Phe did not. Single oral administration (5mg/kg body weight) to spontaneously hypertensive rats led to a significant decrease in blood pressure for both peptides. Docking experiments indicated an active character for Val-Phe and an inactive character for Ala-Val-Phe as potential inhibitors of human ACE. From our results, it can be suggested that after oral administration of Ala-Val-Phe, Val-Phe is released by in vivo peptidases and is responsible for in vivo activity of Ala-Val-Phe. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of in vivo antihypertensive activity of peptides derived from insect protein. The conformational preferences of peptides are strongly determined by hydrogen bonding interactions. Intermolecular solute-solvent interactions compete with intramolecular interactions, which typically stabilize the secondary structure of the peptide. The analysis of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra can give insights into solvation-induced changes in the conformational distribution of small peptides.

438	H-val-val-oh	PUBMED	 Novel Val-Val dipeptide-benzenesulfonamide conjugates were reported in this study. These were achieved by a condensation reaction of p-substituted benzenesulfonamoyl alkanamides with 2-amino-4-methyl-N-substituted phenyl butanamide using classical peptide-coupling reagents. The compounds were characterized using Fourier transform infrared,  Fumaric acid esters (FAE) are beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis. However, about a third of psoriasis patients do not respond to FAE. We aimed to determine whether glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms are associated with treatment outcome in psoriasis patients treated with FAE. We studied 84 psoriasis patients who were treated with FAE for 3 months. FAE nonresponders were defined as having psoriasis area and severity improvement index less than 50% after 3-month therapy. GSTM1 genotyping for gene deletion and GSTP1 exon 5 105 Ile→Val polymorphisms were assessed using a high-resolution melting analysis. A dropout rate of 23.8% (20/84) was found; 25% (16/64) were FAE nonresponders. We observed 42 (84/50%) patients with G 9STM1*0 homozygous alleles and 42 (84/50%) patients with one or two active GSTM1 alleles. The Ile/Ile GSTP1 genotype was observed in 37 (84/44%), the Ile/Val GSTP1 genotype in 38 (84/45.2%) patients and the Val/Val GSTP1 genotype in nine (84/10.7%) patients. There was no significant (P>0.05) association between the GST genotypes assessed and the frequency FAE responder status, except for the Val/Val GSTP1 polymorphism, which was a significant (overall model fit; P=0.0012) predictor for nonresponders with an odds ratio of 43.4 (95% confidence interval: 4.2-511.1). The coefficient of regression was 3.9, with a SE of 1.2 as assessed by logistic regression analysis (P=0.0017). The Val/Val GSTP1 polymorphism predicts nonresponders in FAE treatment of psoriasis patients and may therefore serve as a biomarker that enables a laboratory-based pretreatment selection of patients. In this study, we evaluated the effect of rs6265 polymorphism on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and relevant downstream targets, as well as the involvement of this polymorphism in bladder cancer. A computational analysis and luciferase assays were used to explore the interaction among BDNF, miR-205, and cyclin J (CCNJ). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis were carried out to determine the effect of rs6265 polymorphism on the expression of BDNF and relevant downstream genes. BDNF directly inhibited miR-205 expression but enhanced the expression of CCNJ, which was identified as a virtual target gene of miR-205. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of BDNF carrying the Val genotype, defined as BDNF (Val), on miR-205 expression was much stronger than that of BDNF (Met), while the inductive effect of BDNF (Val) on CCNJ expression was much weaker than that of BDNF (Met). miR-205 and CCNJ small interfering RNA (siRNA) were found to reduce cell proliferation and arrest the cells in G0/G1 phase. In addition, miR-205 expression in patients carrying BDNF genotyped as Met/Met (defined as Met/Met group) was much higher than patients carrying BDNF genotyped as Val/Val and Val/Met (defined as Val/Val group and Val/Met group). As an inhibitor of CCNJ expression, the inhibitory effect of miR-205 was much higher in the Met/Met group than that in the Val/Val and Val/Met groups. In summary, we suggested that the rs6265 polymorphism in BDNF upregulates the expression of CCNJ in bladder cancer via the inhibition of miR-205 expression, which leads to the promoted proliferation of bladder cancer cells.

442	Cis-montelukast	PUBMED	 Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

451	34522-32-2	WIKIPEDIA	Octopine is a derivative of the amino acids arginine and alanine. It was the first member of the class of chemical compounds known as opines to be discovered. Octopine gets its name from Octopus octopodia from which it was first isolated in 1927. Octopine has been isolated from the muscle tissue of invertebrates such as octopus, Pecten maximus and Sipunculus nudus where it functions as an analog of lactic acid. Plants may also produce this compound after infection by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and transfer of the octopine synthesis gene from the bacterium to the plant. Octopine is formed by reductive condensation of pyruvic acid and arginine through the action of the NADH-dependent enzyme octopine dehydrogenase (ODH). The reaction is reversible so that pyruvic acid and arginine can be regenerated. == References ==	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -0.12469481}
456	51-59-2	PUBMED	 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is a fundamental treatment for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). 5-ASA is taken up into the colonic mucosa and metabolized to N-acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA). Few studies have assessed whether mucosal 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA concentrations are associated with endoscopic remission. This study aimed to investigate differences in 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA concentrations according to endoscopic activity. This single-center, prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2018 and February 2019. UC patients who were administered with 5-ASA medication for at least 8 weeks before sigmoidoscopy were enrolled. Mucosal 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The primary endpoint was defined as the difference in mucosal concentrations of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA, according to the Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES). Mucosal concentrations were analyzed in 50 patients. In the sigmoid colon, the median 5-ASA concentration in patients with MES of 0 (17.3 ng/mg) was significantly higher than MES ≥ 1 (6.4 ng/mg) (P = 0.019). The median 5-ASA concentrations in patients with Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity ≤ 1 (16.4 ng/mg) were also significantly higher than in patients with Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity ≥ 2 (4.63 ng/mg) (P = 0.047). In the sigmoid colon, the concentration of Ac-5-ASA was higher in patients with MES of 0 (21.2 ng/mg) than in patients with MES ≥ 1 (5.81 ng/mg) (P = 0.022). The present study showed that mucosal Ac-5-ASA concentrations, as well as 5-ASA concentrations, are higher in UC patients with endoscopic remission. Ac-5-ASA may be useful for a biomarker of 5-ASA efficacy. The aim of this study was to investigate the transporter-mediated transport of N-acetyl 5-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-5-ASA) and the effect of quercetin on Ac-5-ASA transport. Caco-2 cell monolayers grown in Transwells were used to study the transport of Ac-5-ASA in the absence or presence of quercetin, and apical-to-basolateral and basolateral-to-apical apparent permeability (PappAB and PappBA values, respectively) was determined. The effect of transporter inhibitors, such as MK571, quinidine and mitoxantrone, on the transport of Ac-5-ASA was investigated. In the absence of transporter mediators, the transport of Ac-5-ASA was much higher in the basolateral-to-apical direction than in the opposite direction. The PappBA/PappAB ratio of Ac-5-ASA was 4.89. Quercetin inhibited the apical efflux of Ac-5-ASA and decreased the PappBA/PappAB ratio to 1.05. Of the transporter inhibitors, MK571 decreased the PappBA/PappAB ratio to 1.07; however, neither quinidine nor mitoxantrone had an effect on Ac-5-ASA transport. Ac-5-ASA was excreted by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 from Caco-2 cells, and its transport was inhibited by quercetin. Our findings suggest that dose levels of sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid can be decreased by coadministration of quercetin, leading to improved pharmaceutical care for inflammatory bowel diseases. In a double-blind controlled therapeutic trial, retention enemas of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-5-ASA) were compared with dummy enemas in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. Forty patients were studied, each patient taking one test enema twice a day for 2 weeks. Seventeen of the patients had a mild clinical attack of the disease; the 23 others had sigmoidoscopic evidence of active inflammation although they were in clinical remission. Histological and sigmoidoscopic improvement were significantly commoner in the patients receiving the active treatment than in those taking the dummy preparation. Pronounced histological improvement was only seen in patients taking the Ac-5-ASA enemas. In those patients who had clinical attacks of ulcerative colitis at the start of the study, symptomatic improvement was commoner in the group treated with Ac-5-ASA enemas than in those who received placebo therapy. Ac-5-ASA resembles 5-aminosalicylic acid in its effect on the inflamed mucosa in ulcerative colitis. Further studies into other substituted salicylates may lead to the development of an effective oral agent that does not carry the side effects associated with the sulphapyridine moiety of sulphasalazine.

457	1946-82-3	PUBMED	 The photoinduced exchange reactions of cytosine (Ia) and 5-methylcytosine (IIa) with N alpha-acetyl-L-lysine, a derivative of the common amino acid L-lysine, were studied. These reactions of Ia and IIa at pH 7.5 produce, respectively, 2-N-acetylamino-6-(1-cytosinyl)hexanoic acid (Ib) and 2-N-acetylamino-6-(1-(5-methylcytosinyl]hexanoic acid (IIb) as major final products. In addition, small amounts of the corresponding deamination products were formed in the 5-methylcytosine-N alpha-acetyl-L-lysine and cytosine-N alpha-acetyl-L-lysine systems, namely 2-N-acetylamino-6-(1-thyminyl)-hexanoic acid and 2-N-acetylamino-6-(1-uracilyl)hexanoic acid. The compounds Ib and IIb were deacetylated by acid hydrolysis to yield the corresponding lysine products: 2-amino-6-(1-cytosinyl)hexanoic acid (Ic) and 2-amino-6-(1-(5-methylcytosinyl]hexanoic acid (IIc). The compound Ic was identified as a product in the photoreaction of cytosine with L-lysine at near neutral pH, while IIc is found as a product in the corresponding reaction of 5-methylcytosine. The occurrence of the above photoexchange reactions at pH values near those found in physiological systems could have biological implications; in particular, our observations suggest that cytosine and 5-methylcytosine residues, contained in DNA, might react with the epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues in proteins upon UV irradiation of nucleosomes and other DNA-protein complexes under physiological conditions. Capillary electrophoresis using a capillary coated with a double-strand coating of polyaniline:poly(methyacrylate-co-acrylic acid) (PAN:P[MA-AAI) was used to separate advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) formed at 37 degrees C from model systems containing either glucose (Glc), fructose (Fru), or glyceraldehyde (GA) and N-alpha-acetyl-L-lysine (NALys). The presence of the P(MA-AA) as a second strand in the polymer allows the maintenance of the conductive state of the PAN at a wide pH range. Effects of buffer pH and coating concentration on the electroosmotic flow (EOF) were investigated. More AGE species can be detected for the GA/NALys mixtures using this coated capillary than upon an uncoated capillary. The coating procedure is simple and the stability of the coated capillary is good.	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -0.00039170796}
458	2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose	WIKIPEDIA	N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is an amide derivative of the monosaccharide glucose. It is a secondary amide between glucosamine and acetic acid. It is significant in several biological systems. It is part of a biopolymer in the bacterial cell wall, which is built from alternating units of GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), cross-linked with oligopeptides at the lactic acid residue of MurNAc. This layered structure is called peptidoglycan (formerly called murein). GlcNAc is the monomeric unit of the polymer chitin, which forms the exoskeletons of arthropods like insects and crustaceans. It is the main component of the radulas of mollusks, the beaks of cephalopods, and a major component of the cell walls of most fungi. Polymerized with glucuronic acid, it forms hyaluronan. GlcNAc has been reported to be an inhibitor of elastase release from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (range 8–17% inhibition), however this is much weaker than the inhibition seen with N-acetylgalactosamine (range 92–100%). == Medical uses == It has been proposed as a treatment for autoimmune diseases and recent tests have claimed some success. == O-GlcNAcylation == O-GlcNAcylation is the process of adding a single N-acetylglucosamine sugar to the serine or threonine of a protein. Comparable to phosphorylation, addition or removal of N-acetylglucosamine is a means of activating or deactivating enzymes or transcription factors. In fact, O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation often compete for the same serine/threonine sites. O-GlcNAcylation most often occurs on chromatin proteins, and is often seen as a response to stress. Hyperglycemia increases O-GlcNAcylation, leading to insulin resistance. Increased O-GlcNAcylation due to hyperglycemia is evidently a dysfunctional form of O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAcylation decline in the brain with age is associated with cognitive decline. When O-GlcNAcylation was increased in the hippocampus of aged mice, spatial learning and memory improved. == See also == Keratan sulfate N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) N-Acetyllactosamine synthase Wheat germ agglutinin, a plant lectin that binds to this substrate == References == == External links == Re Multiple Sclerosis	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.0026675693, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.1652511, ' FOOD': -0.00023691374}
461	N-acetyl-l-glutamic acid	WIKIPEDIA	N-Acetylglutamic acid (also referred to as N-acetylglutamate, abbreviated NAG, chemical formula C7H11NO5) is biosynthesized from glutamate and acetylornithine by ornithine acetyltransferase, and from glutamic acid and acetyl-CoA by the enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase. The reverse reaction, hydrolysis of the acetyl group, is catalyzed by a specific hydrolase. It is the first intermediate involved in the biosynthesis of arginine in prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes and a regulator in the process known as the urea cycle that converts toxic ammonia to urea for excretion from the body in vertebrates. == Discovery == N-Acetylglutamic acid is an extracellular metabolite isolated from the prokaryote Rhizobium trifolii that was characterized using many structure determination techniques such as proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In Rhizobium, extracellular build-up of N-acetylglutamic acid is due to metabolism involving nod factor genes on a symbiotic plasmid. When the nod factors are mutated, less N-acetylglutamic acid is produced. == Biosynthesis == === Prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes === In prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes, N-acetylglutamic acid can be produced by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) or ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT). ==== Ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT) synthesis ==== OAT synthesizes N-acetylglutamic acid from glutamate and acetylornithine and is the method of choice for production in prokaryotes that have the ability to synthesize the compound ornithine. ==== N-Acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) synthesis ==== N-Acetylglutamate synthase is an enzyme that serves as a replenisher of N-acetylglutamic acid to supplement any N-acetylglutamic acid lost by the cell through mitosis or degradation. NAGS synthesizes N-acetylglutamic acid by catalyzing the addition of an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A to glutamate. In prokaryotes with non-cyclic ornithine production, NAGS is the sole method of N-acetylglutamic acid synthesis and is inhibited by arginine. Acetylation of glutamate is thought to prevent glutamate from being used by proline biosynthesis. === Vertebrates === In contrast to prokaryotes, NAGS in mammals is enhanced by arginine, along with protamines. It is inhibited by N-acetylglutamic acid and its analogues (other N-acetylated compounds). The brain also contains N-acetylglutamic acid at trace amounts, however no expression of NAGS is found. This suggests that N-acetylglutamic acid is produced by another enzyme in the brain that is yet to be determined. == Biological roles == === Vertebrates and mammals === In vertebrae and mammals, N-acetylglutamic acid is the allosteric activator molecule to mitochondrial carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) which is the first enzyme in the urea cycle. It triggers the production of the first urea cycle intermediate, carbamyl phosphate. CPSI is inactive when N-acetylglutamic acid is not present. In the liver and small intestines, N-acetylglutamic acid-dependent CPSI produces citrulline, the second intermediate in the urea cycle. Liver cell distribution of N-acetylglutamic acid is highest in the mitochondria at 56% of total N-acetylglutamic acid availability, 24% in the nucleus, and the remaining 20% in the cytosol. Aminoacylase I in liver and kidney cells degrades N-acetylglutamic acid to glutamate and acetate. In contrast, N-acetylglutamic acid is not the allosteric cofactor to carbamyl phosphate synthetase found in the cytoplasm, which is involved in pyrimidine synthesis. N-acetylglutamic acid concentrations increase when protein consumption increases due to the accumulation of ammonia that must be secreted through the urea cycle, which supports the role of N-acetylglutamic acid as the cofactor for CPSI. Furthermore, N-acetylglutamic acid can be found in many commonly consumed foods such as soy, corn, and coffee, with cocoa powder containing a notably high concentration. Deficiency in N-acetylglutamic acid in humans is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in blockage of urea production which ultimately increases the concentration of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). Deficiency can be caused by defects in the NAGS coding gene or by deficiencies in the precursors essential for synthesis. === Bacteria === N-Acetylglutamic acid is the second intermediate in the arginine production pathway in Escherichia coli and is produced via NAGS. In this pathway, N-acetylglutamic acid kinase (NAGK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of the gamma (third) carboxyl group of N-acetylglutamic acid using the phosphate produced by hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). === White clover seedling roots === Rhizobium can form a symbiotic relationship with white clover seedling roots and form colonies. The extracellular N-acetylglutamic acid produced by these bacteria have three morphological effects on the white clover seedling roots: branching of root hairs, swelling of root tips, and increase in the number of cell divisions in undifferentiated cells found on the outer-most cell layer of the root. This suggests that N-acetylglutamic acid is involved in the stimulation of mitosis. The same effects were observed on the strawberry clover, but not in legumes. The effects of N-acetylglutamic acid on the clover species were more potent than the effects from glutamine, glutamate, arginine, or ammonia. == Structure == N-Acetylglutamic acid is composed of two carboxylic acid groups and an amide group protruding from the second carbon. The structure of N-acetylglutamic acid at physiological pH (7.4) has all carboxyl groups deprotonated. === Proton NMR spectroscopy === The molecular structure of N-acetylglutamic acid was determined using proton NMR spectroscopy. Proton NMR reveals the presence and functional group location of protons based on chemical shifts recorded on the spectrum. === 13C NMR spectroscopy === Like proton NMR, carbon-13 (13C) NMR spectroscopy is a method used in molecular structure determination. 13C NMR reveals the types of carbons present in a molecule based on chemical shifts that correspond to certain functional groups.

464	84211-46-1	PUBMED	 Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that is mainly triggered by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. A growing body of evidence suggests that ferroptosis is involved in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) deficiency would mediate TBI pathologies. As an agonist of TrkB and an immediate precursor of melatonin, N-acetyl serotonin (NAS) exerts several beneficial effects on TBI, but there is no information regarding the role of NAS in ferroptosis after TBI. Here, we examined the effect of NAS treatment on TBI-induced functional outcomes and ferroptosis. Remarkably, the administration of NAS alleviated TBI-induced neurobehavioral deficits, lesion volume, and neurodegeneration. NAS also rescued TBI-induced mitochondrial shrinkage, the changes in ferroptosis-related molecule expression, and iron accumulation in the ipsilateral cortex. Similar results were obtained with a well-established ferroptosis inhibitor, liproxstatin-1. Furthermore, NAS activated the TrkB/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway in the mouse model of TBI, while inhibition of PI3K and Nrf2 weakened the protection of NAS against ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that a possible pathway linking NAS to the action of anti-ferroptosis was TrkB/PI3K/Akt/Nrf2. Given that ferritin H (Fth) is a known transcription target of Nrf2, we then investigated the effects of NAS on neuron-specific Fth knockout (Fth-KO) mice. Strikingly, Fth deletion almost abolished the protective effects of NAS against TBI-induced ferroptosis and synaptic damage, although Fth deletion-induced susceptibility toward ferroptosis after TBI was reversed by an iron chelator, deferoxamine. Taken together, these data indicate that the TrkB agonist NAS treatment appears to improve brain function after TBI by suppressing ferroptosis, at least in part, through activation of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2/Fth pathway, providing evidence that NAS is likely to be a promising anti-ferroptosis agent for further treatment for TBI. In the setting of bone defects, the injured vasculature and loss of hemodynamic inflow leads to hematoma formation and low oxygen tension which stimulates vascular expansion through the HIf-1α pathway. Most importantly, this pathway upregulates sprouting of type H vessels (CD31hiEmcnhi vessels). H vessels engage in direct interaction with perivascular osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs), osteoblasts, and preosteoclasts of bone formation and remodeling. This angiogenic-osteogenic coupling leads to synchronous propagation of vascular and bony tissue for regenerative healing. A growing body of literature demonstrates that H vessels constitute a large portion of bone's innate capacity for osteogenic healing. We believe that CD31hiEmcnhi vessels play a role in bone healing during distraction osteogenesis (DO). DO is a procedure that utilizes traction forces to facilitate induction of endogenous bone formation and regeneration of surrounding soft tissues such as skin, muscle, tendon, and neurovascular structures. While the H vessel response to mechanical injury is adequate to facilitate healing in normal healthy tissue, it remains inadequate to overcome the devastation of radiation. We posit that the destruction of CD31hiEmcnhi vessels plays a role in precluding DO's effectiveness in irradiated bone defect healing. We aim, therefore, to recapitulate the normal pathway of bony healing by utilizing the regenerative capacity of H vessels. We hypothesize that using localized application of deferoxamine (DFO) will enhance the H vessel-mediated vasculogenic response to radiation damage and ultimately enable osteogenic healing during DO. This discovery could potentially be exploited by developing translational therapeutics to hopefully accelerate bone formation and shorten the DO consolidation period, thereby potentially expanding DO's utilization in irradiated bone healing. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: DO, radiation with DO (xDO), and radiation with DO and DFO implantation (xDODFO). Experimental groups received 35 Gy of radiation. All groups underwent DO. The treatment group received injections into the osteotomy site, every other day, beginning on postoperative day (POD) 4 of DFO. Animals were sacrificed on POD 40. For immunohistochemical analysis, mandibles were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours, decalcified in Cal-Ex II for 2 days, dehydrated through graded ethanol of increasing concentration, and then embedded in paraffin. Samples were cut into 7-μm thick longitudinally oriented sections including the metaphysis and diaphysis. CD31 and Emcn double immunofluorescent staining were performed to evaluate the extent of CD31hiEmcnhi vessel formation. Bone sections were then stained with conjugated antibodies overnight at 4°C. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst. Slides were also double stained with Osterix and CD31 to study the quantity of H vessel-mediated recruitment of OPCs to accelerate bone healing. Images were acquired with a Nikon Ti2 widefield microscope and analyzed in NIS- Elements Advanced Research 5.41.02 software. The abundance of type H vessels is represented by the area fraction of CD31 + Emcn+ vessel area inside the regenerate sample. OPC concomitant proliferation into the distraction gap is represented by the area fraction of Osterix+ cell area inside of the regenerate sample. There were 6× more type H vessels in DO groups than in xDO groups. Localized DFO significantly increased the abundance of type H vessels of irradiated DO animals compared to xDO by 15× (  The formation of a calcified cartilaginous callus (CACC) is crucial during bone repair. CACC can stimulate the invasion of type H vessels into the callus to couple angiogenesis and osteogenesis, induce osteoclastogenesis to resorb the calcified matrix, and promote osteoclast secretion of factors to enhance osteogenesis, ultimately achieving the replacement of cartilage with bone. In this study, a porous polycaprolactone/hydroxyapatite-iminodiacetic acid-deferoxamine (PCL/HA-SF-DFO) 3D biomimetic CACC is developed using 3D printing. The porous structure can mimic the pores formed by the matrix metalloproteinase degradation of the cartilaginous matrix, HA-containing PCL can mimic the calcified cartilaginous matrix, and SF anchors DFO onto HA for the slow release of DFO. The in vitro results show that the scaffold significantly enhances angiogenesis, promotes osteoclastogenesis and resorption by osteoclasts, and enhances the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal stem cells by promoting collagen triple helix repeat-containing 1 expression by osteoclasts. The in vivo results show that the scaffold significantly promotes type H vessels formation and the expression of coupling factors to promote osteogenesis, ultimately enhancing the regeneration of large-segment bone defects in rats and preventing dislodging of the internal fixation screw. In conclusion, the scaffold inspired by biological bone repair processes effectively promotes bone regeneration.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.019803764}

EGF stimulates growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF and at least seven other growth factors and their transmembrane receptor kinases play important roles in cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. The EGF receptor (EGFR) family consists of four transmembrane receptors: EGFR (HER1/erbB-1), HER2 (erbB-2/neu), HER3 (erbB-3), and HER4 (erbB-4) (2). HER1, HER3, and HER4 comprise three major functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. No ligand has been clearly identified for HER2; however, HER2 can be activated as a result of ligand binding to other HER receptors with the formation of receptor homodimers and/or heterodimers (3). HER1 and HER2 are overexpressed on many solid tumor cells such as breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, and colon cancers (4-6). The high levels of HER1 and HER2 expression on cancer cells are associated with poor patient prognosis because high levels are related to increased proliferation (7-10). Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) maps information about tissues spatially and functionally (1). Protons (hydrogen nuclei) are widely used to create images because of their abundance in water molecules, which comprise >80% of most soft tissues. The contrast of proton MRI images depends mainly on the density of nuclear proton spins, the relaxation times of the nuclear magnetization (T1, longitudinal; T2, transverse), the magnetic environment of the tissues, and the blood flow to the tissues. However, insufficient contrast between normal and diseased tissues requires the use of contrast agents. Most contrast agents affect the T1 and T2 relaxation of the surrounding nuclei, mainly the protons of water. T2* is the spin–spin relaxation time composed of variations from molecular interactions and intrinsic magnetic heterogeneities of tissues in the magnetic field (2). Cross-linked iron oxide (CLIO) and other iron oxide formulations affect T2 primarily and lead to a decreased signal.

495	Alpha-aspartylphenylalanine	PUBMED	 Microorganisms produce a large number of pharmacologically and biotechnologically important peptides by using nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Due to their modular arrangement and their domain organization NRPSs are particularly suitable for engineering recombinant proteins for the production of novel peptides with interesting properties. In order to compare different strategies of domain assembling and module fusions we focused on the selective construction of a set of peptide synthetases that catalyze the formation of the dipeptide alpha-l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine (Asp-Phe), the precursor of the high-intensity sweetener alpha-l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester (aspartame). The de novo design of six different Asp-Phe synthetases was achieved by fusion of Asp and Phe activating modules comprising adenylation, peptidyl carrier protein and condensation domains. Product release was ensured by a C-terminally fused thioesterase domains and quantified by HPLC/MS analysis. Significant differences of enzyme activity caused by the fusion strategies were observed. Two forms of the Asp-Phe dipeptide were detected, the expected alpha-Asp-Phe and the by-product beta-Asp-Phe. Dependent on the turnover rates ranging from 0.01-0.7 min-1, the amount of alpha-Asp-Phe was between 75 and 100% of overall product, indicating a direct correlation between the turnover numbers and the ratios of alpha-Asp-Phe to beta-Asp-Phe. Taken together these results provide useful guidelines for the rational construction of hybrid peptide synthetases. Cross-linked polyurethane (PU) was prepared for entrapping thermolysin. Using the immobilized thermolysin (IT), Z-L-aspartic acid (ZA) was reacted with -Lphenylalanine methyl ester (L-PM) in water-saturated ethyl acetate to give only alpha-Z-L-aspartylL-phenylalanine methyl ester (alpha-ZAPM). Ninety-four percent conversion of alpha-ZAPM was obtained for 30 h of reaction at 40 degrees C when 46 mg of enzyme was entrapped. PU support prepared from polypropylene glycol (#2000) showed better properties than from polypropylene (#1000) and polyethylene (#1000). Addition of polyol could increase the gel fraction of PU. The IT PU-ll-G-3, prepared from 1/2 mole ratio of PPG (#2000)/glycerin, gave the highest gel fraction and best swelling, and 89.0% of residual activity was obtained after four times of reuse (72 h). The stability of immobilized thermolysin was good; the activity loss resulting from degradatin and leak of enzyme in each time of reuse were found only about 2%. The kinetics of immobilized thermolysin-catalyzed condensation reaction of ZA with L-PM in water-saturated ethyl acetate was found to be first order in L-PM and the Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/V against 1/[ZA] yields a straight line, showing that the reaction involves consecutive reactions of ZA and L-PM with the immobilized enzyme and with the ZA-immobilized enzyme complex, with the second reaction being the rate determining step. Screening was carried out for microorganisms able to produce N-(l-alpha-l-aspartyl)-l-phenylalanine methyl ester [APM] from l-isoasparagine and l-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride. Of the 422 strains examined, 44 strains belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae were found to produce APM. The enzyme catalyzing APM production was purified and identified as dipeptidase E.

Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG We present here five new hemoglobin (Hb) variants which have been identified during routine Hb analysis before their genotypic characterization. Four of these result from a classical missense mutation: Hb Canuts [alpha85(F6)Asp-->His (alpha1)], Hb Ambroise Pare [alpha117(GH5)Phe-->Ile (alpha2)], Hb Beaujolais [beta84(EF8)Thr-->Asn] and HbA(2)-North Africa [delta59(E3)Lys-->Met]. The last one, Hb Monplaisir [beta147 (Tyr-Lys-Leu-Ala-Phe-Phe-Leu-Leu-Ser-Asn-Phe-Tyr-158-COOH)], results from a frameshift mutation at the stop codon of the beta-globin gene which leads to a modified C-terminal sequence in the beta-globin chain. None of these variants seem to have a particular clinical expression in the heterozygous state. The circumstances of the discovery of these five new Hb variants emphasize the fact that an association of techniques is necessary for a complete screening of Hb variants during routine Hb analysis. Globin chain separation by reversed phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) appears to be the most relevant method. Pancreatic cancer is a digestive system malignant carcinoma with poor prognosis. The majority of patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease, which is also the leading cause of pancreatic cancer death. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimetastatic effect of Asn-Phe-Gly-Lys (NFGK), a tetrapeptide derived from bovine hemoglobin pepsin hydrolysate, on human pancreatic cancer cell line MIAPaCa-2. Wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay results showed that NFGK inhibited MIAPaCa-2 cell migration and invasion dose-dependently. Cell proliferation assay data showed that NFGK had slight cytotoxicity on MIAPaCa-2 cells. Fluorescence confocal imaging data revealed that NFGK targeted the cell membrane of MIAPaCa-2. Molecular docking data displayed that NFGK bond to the N-terminus ATP-binding pocket of secreted heat shock protein 90α (Hsp90α). Western blotting results further proved that NFGK inhibited secreted Hsp90α and downstream matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) level dose dependently, while it did not inhibit intracellular Hsp90 and cyclin-dependent-kinase 4 (CDK4). All above results demonstrated that bovine hemoglobin derived peptide NFGK inhibited pancreatic cancer cell metastasis by targeting secreted Hsp90α and its downstream MMP-9. Peptide NFGK comes from bovine hemoglobin, which is digested by pepsin in stomach after eating. After digesting to NFGK, bovine hemoglobin will obtain new function of inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell metastasis without dramatic cell toxicity. These means NFGK may help those patients who are suffering pancreatic cancer to avoid cancer cell metastasis without too much side effect.	INFO	FOOD	{'FO': -0.38243756, 'OD': 0.0}

503	Phenylalanylglutamate	PUBMED	 The murine immune response patterns to (Phe-Glu-Ala-Gly)n and (Phe-Ala-Glu-Gly)n differ from those of the tyrosine analogues (Tyr-Glu-Ala-Gly)n and (Tyr-Ala-Glu-Gly)n. (Phe-Glu-Ala-Gly)n was not immunogenetic in inbred, congenic or recombinant strains of mice. (Phe-Ala-Glu-Gly)n was immunogenic only in mice having f alleles in the IA subregion of the H-2 complex. Reciprocal in vitro cross reactions were noted with T cells from mice of H-2f that respond to either (Phe-Ala-Glu-Gly)n or (Tyr-Ala-Glu-Gly)n. T cells from mice of H-2b, which are responders to (Tyr-Glu-Ala-Gly)n, could not be stimulated with the nonimmunogenic (Phe-Glu-Ala-Gly)n. These results support other studies showing that for any polymer to elicit cross T-cell proliferative responses it must be (a) structurally related to the homologous polymer and (b) immunogenic in the mouse strain whose T cells are being challenged in vitro. Explanations are offered for these statements. Antibodies elicited against the two synthetic polypeptides, poly(Tyr,Glu)-poly(DLAla)-poly(Lys) [(T,G)-A-L] and poly(Phe,Glu)-poly(DLAla)-poly(Lys) [(Phe,G)-A-L], are crossreactive although the humoral responses to these immunogens are under different genetic controls. The fine specificity of the antibodies elicited by the two polypeptides was studied in the present work. Antisera against (Phe,G)-A-L bind both (125)I-labeled (T,G)-A-L and iodinated modified (Phe,G)-A-L. However, while the binding to (T,G)-A-L could be inhibited completely with the two antigens, the binding to (Phe,G)-A-L was inhibited completely with (Phe,G)-A-L and only partially with (T,G)-A-L. The binding of (125)I-labeled (T,G)-A-L to antisera against (T,G)-A-L was inhibted more efficiently by the homologous antigen than by (Phe,G)-A-L although both antigens completely inhibited the binding. (T,G)-A-L specific antibodies were purified on (T,G)-A-L immunoadsorbents from antisera of high and low responder mice to (T,G)-A-L immunized with (Phe,G)-A-L. (Phe,G)-A-L specific antibodies that did not bind (T,G)-A-L were isolated from the effluent of these columns. By use of anti-idiotypic antibodies of guinea pig against C3H.SW antibodies to (T,G)-A-L it was shown that (T,G)-A-L specific antibodies isolated from antisera against (Phe,G)-A-L of C3H.SW and C3H/DiSn mice possess part of the idiotypic determinants existing on antibodies of C3H.SW obtained by immunization with (T,G)-A-L. In contrast, antibodies to (Phe,G)-A-L that did not bind (T,G)-A-L did not share idiotypic determinants with C3H.SW antibody molecules against (T,G)-A-L. These results suggest that the B cell repertoire expressed by high and low responders to (T,G)-A-L after immunization with (Phe,G)-A-L is similar and represents only part of that of high responders immunized with (T,G)-A-L. To construct a possible model of hydrolytic enzymes, the sequential polypeptide H[Cys(Acm)-Ser-Phe-Glu-Glu]nOH, n = 3-110, was prepared by polycondensation of H-Cys(Acm)-Ser(But)-Phe-Glu(OBut)-Glu(OBut)-O Su/1-hydroxybenzotriazole. In a solid state the polypeptide material showed beta-conformation both before and after cleavage of t-butyl protecting groups.

504	17355-18-9	PUBMED	 In-depth analytical characterization of biotherapeutics originating from different production batches is mandatory to ensure product safety and consistent molecule efficacy. Previously, we have shown unintended incorporation of tyrosine (Tyr) and leucine/isoleucine (Leu/Ile) at phenylalanine (Phe) positions in a recombinant produced monoclonal antibody (mAb) using an orthogonal MASCOT/SIEVE based approach for mass spectrometry data analysis. The misincorporation could be avoided by sufficient supply of phenylalanine throughout the process. Several non-annotated signals in the primarily chromatographic peptide separation step for apparently single Phe→Tyr sequence variants (SVs) suggest a role for isobar tyrosine isoforms. Meta- and ortho-Tyr are spontaneously generated during aerobic fed-batch production processes using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Process induced meta- and ortho-Tyr but not proteinogenic para-Tyr are incorporated at Phe locations in Phe-starved CHO cultures expressing a recombinant mAb. Furthermore, meta- and ortho-Tyr are preferably misincorporated over Leu. Structural modeling of the l-phenylalanyl-tRNA-synthetase (PheRS) substrate activation site indicates a possible fit of non-cognate ortho-Tyr and meta-Tyr substrates. Dose-dependent misincorporations of Tyr isoforms support the hypothesis that meta- and ortho-Tyr are competing, alternative substrates for PheRS in CHO processes. Finally, easily accessible at-line surrogate markers for Phe→Tyr SV formation in biotherapeutic production were defined by the calculation of critical ratios for meta-Tyr/Phe and ortho-Tyr/Phe to support early prediction of SV probability, and finally, to allow for immediate process controlled Phe→Tyr SV prevention.

Osteotomies of the distal femur were fixed with these rods (2 mm by 15 mm) in 64 other rats. The follow-up times varied from 1 week to 1 year. After sacrifice, three-point bending and shear tests and molecular weight measurements were performed for subcutaneously placed rods. Radiological, histological, histomorphometrical, microradiographic, and oxytetracycline-fluorescence studies of the osteotomized and intact control femurs were performed. At 36 weeks, the bending strength of the rods was nearly at the same level as the initial value, and the shear strength was decreased to about one quarter of the initial value. One of the 64 evaluated osteotomies showed signs of infection at 24 weeks, and there were five failures of fixation. Fifty-eight osteotomies healed uneventfully. No gross signs of inflammatory or foreign-body reactions were observed. The present investigation showed that the mechanical strength and fixation properties of SR-poly(DTE carbonate) rods are suitable for fixation of cancellous bone osteotomies in rats.

526	Ala-phe	PUBMED	 The separation of stereoisomers, particularly enantiomers, is important when their physiological activity differs. We have resolved the four stereoisomers each of alanylphenylalanine (Ala-Phe) and of leucylphenylalanine (Leu-Phe) by capillary electrophoresis using beta-cyclodextrin as a buffer additive and urea to enhance its solubility. A study of the influence of pH and beta-cyclodextrin concentration on the separations showed that weak inclusion complexes were formed between the dipeptides and chiral selector. It was found that pH could alter the migration order of enantiomers L-Ala-L-Phe and D-Ala-D-Phe, as well as L-Leu-L-Phe and D-Leu-D-Phe; however, there was no change in order for the other pairs of optical isomers. Electrophoretic mobility data were used to estimate the acid dissociation constants of the dipeptide isomers at pH < 7 with no chiral selector present. By varying the concentration of beta-cyclodextrin, the chiral selector, the binding constants of Ala-Phe and Leu-Phe optical isomers in their fully protonated and zwitterionic forms were estimated. For the four Ala-Phe stereoisomers, K = 42-66 M(-1) and 4-41 M(-1) for the cationic and zwitterionic forms, respectively. For the four Leu-Phe stereoisomers, K = 43-94 M(-1) and 1-28 M(-1) for the cationic and zwitterionic forms, respectively. The separation of the ll- and dd-enantiomers of the dipeptides Ala-Phe, Ala-phenylglycine (Phg), Ala-homoPhe, Ala-β-Phe, Gly-Phe and β-Ala-Phe was studied by capillary electrophoresis in the presence of negatively charged α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives. Analysis was performed under standardized conditions in fused-silica capillaries at pH 2.5, 3.5 and 5.3. All analyte enantiomers could be separated at pH 2.5 under at least one of the experimental conditions. Especially β-CD derivatives proved to be effective chiral selectors. The enantiomer migration order depended on CD cavity size and substituent type, while peptide structure had only a minor effect. Upon increasing the pH from 2.5 to 5.3, reversal of the enantiomer migration order was observed frequently. Investigation of the apparent and, in the case of randomly substituted CDs, averaged complexation constants and mobilities of the diastereomeric peptide enantiomer-CD complexes indicated that in most cases the migration order in the presence of sulfated α-, β- and γ-CD and heptakis(6-O-sulfo)-β-CD could be explained by the stronger binding of the second migrating analyte by the CD at pH 2.5. However, in few cases the weaker bound enantiomer migrated second, which could be attributed to the higher mobility of the respective CD complexes.

558	Phe-thr	PUBMED	 A nanoantioxidant of mesoporous organosilica (Trp-Met-PMO) based on the framework of tryptophan-methionine dipeptide was first designed and constructed by condensation between self-created dipeptide organosilica precursor (Trp-Met-Si) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in alkaline conditions under the template hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). Trp-Met-Si was prepared by the reaction between dipeptide Trp-Met and conventional organosilicon coupling agent isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane (IPTES) via a multiple-step reaction method. The material Trp-Met-PMO was confirmed by XRD, FT-IR and N Hypertension is a significant risk factor for various diseases, especially heart, brain, and kidney diseases. It is known that many peptides have the property of lowering blood pressure and determine as ACE inhibitors. The purpose of this study is to obtain information about the molecular structure of Val-Trp (L-valyl-L-tryptophan), which is one of the antihypertensive peptides, by molecular mechanical, quantum mechanical, and spectroscopic methods (FT-IR and Raman). Also, it is aimed to investigate the interactions of Val-Trp dipeptide with receptors related to hypertension and to determine the pharmacokinetic profile due to the potential of the peptide to be a drug candidate. The peptide structure was optimized by DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) basis set, then vibrational wavenumbers, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), HOMO-LUMO (highest occupied molecular orbital- lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), NBO (natural bond orbital) analyzes were performed. The assignment of fundamental theoretical vibration wavenumbers was carried out with potential energy distribution analysis (PED). After the structural analyzes of the peptide were performed, the interactions of the peptide with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Angiotensin II Receptor Type 1 (AT1R) and Renin were investigated by molecular docking study. Then, the molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of the peptide-ACE complex with the best binding affinity in the molecular docking studies was carried out for 50 ns. ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) analysis of Val-Trp dipeptide was performed. In support of the studies carried out, enlightening information about the feasibility of the antihypertensive drug of Val-Trp dipeptide with the help of the ADME profile was presented to the literature.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

559	H-thr-phe-oh	PUBMED	 Somatostatin (SST) is an inhibitor of the release of somatotropin, glucagon, insulin, gastrointestinal hormones, and other secretory proteins (1). SST is also known as somatotropin release-inhibiting factor (SRIF). SST is a cyclic polypeptide with two biologically active isoforms, SRIF-14 and SRIF-28, of 14 and 28 amino acids, respectively. SRIF has a short plasma half-life of <3 min (2). SST receptors (SSTRs) (G-protein–coupled) have been found on a variety of neuroendocrine tumors and cells of the immune system, and five individual subtypes (sst Somatostatin (SST) is an inhibitor of the release of somatotropin, glucagon, insulin, gastrointestinal hormones, and other secretory proteins (1).

Regulation of protein synthesis via AA occurs at least in part by alterations in the phosphorylation status of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway proteins. Although the ideal profile of Lys:Met to promote milk protein synthesis during established lactation in dairy cows has been proposed to be 3:1, aside from being the most-limiting AA for milk protein synthesis, the role of Met in other key biologic pathways such as methylation is not well characterized in the bovine. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of increasing supplemental Met, based on the ideal 3:1 ratio of Lys to Met, on intracellular metabolism related to protein synthesis and mTOR pathway phosphorylation status. MAC-T cells, an immortalized bovine mammary epithelial cell line, were incubated (n = 5 replicates/treatment) for 12 h with 3 incremental doses of Met while holding Lys concentration constant to achieve the following: Lys:Met 2.9:1 (ideal AA ratio; IPAA), Lys:Met 2.5:1 (LM2.5), and Lys:Met 2.0:1 (LM2.0). The ratios of Thr:Phe (1.05:1), Lys:Thr (1.8:1), Lys:His (2.38:1), and Lys:Val (1.23:1) were the same across the 3 treatments. Applying gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics revealed distinct clusters of differentially concentrated metabolites in response to Lys:Met. Lower Phe, branched-chain AA, and putrescine concentrations were observed with LM2.5 compared with IPAA. Apart from greater intracellular Met concentrations, further elevations in Met level (LM2.0) led to greater intracellular concentrations of nonessential AA (Pro, Glu, Gln, and Gly) compared with IPAA and greater essential AA (EAA; Met, Ile, and Leu) and nonessential AA (Pro, Gly, Ala, Gln, and Glu) compared with LM2.5. However, compared with IPAA, mRNA expression of β-casein and AA transporters (SLC7A5, SLC36A1, SLC38A2, SLC38A9, and SLC43A1) and mTOR phosphorylation were lower in response to LM2.5 and LM2.0. Overall, the results of this study provide evidence that increasing Met while Lys and the ratios of Phe, Thr, His, and Val relative to Lys were held constant could increase the concentration and utilization of intracellular EAA, in particular branched-chain AA, potentially through improving the activity of AA transporters partly controlled by mTOR signaling. Because EAA likely are metabolized by other tissues upon absorption, a question for future in vivo studies is whether formulating diets for optimal ratios of EAA in the metabolizable protein is sufficient to provide the desired levels of these AA to the mammary cells.

560	H-thr-leu-oh	PUBMED	 Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly being used to obtain images of biological functions of specific targets  Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly being used to monitor biological functions of specific targets in small animals (1-3). However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the natural background fluorescence interference of biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues in small animals. NIR fluorophores have a wider dynamic range and minimal background fluorescence as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. NIR fluorophores also have high sensitivity, attributable to low background fluorescence, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals. Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans that surround connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (4). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play a role in inflammation and atherogenesis, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (5). Invasive tumor cells adhere to the ECM, which provides a matrix environment for permeation of tumor cells through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases by tumor cells allows intravasation of tumor cells into the circulatory system after degrading the basement membrane and ECM (6). Several families of proteases are involved in atherogenesis, myocardial infarction, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastases (7-10). The gelatinase family is a subgroup of MMPs consisting of gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) (11). Gelatinase expression in normal cells, such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils, and macrophages, is highly regulated. Elevated levels of gelatinases have been found in tumors associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients (12).

566	Beta-muricholic acid	PUBMED	 Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

572	Sumaresinol	PUBMED	 Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability. Currently, there is no effective pharmacological treatment for this disease, which can be partially attributed to the inability to efficiently deliver therapeutics to the brain. Here we report the development of natural compound-derived nanoparticles (NPs), which function both as a potent therapeutic agent for stroke treatment and as an efficient carrier for drug delivery to the ischemic brain. First, we screened a collection of natural nanomaterials and identified betulinic acid (BA) as one of the most potent antioxidants for stroke treatment. Next, we engineered BA NPs for preferential drug release in acidic ischemic tissue through chemically converting BA to betulinic amine (BAM) and for targeted drug delivery through surface conjugation of AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist. The resulting AMD3100-conjugated BAM NPs, or A-BAM NPs, were then assessed as a therapeutic agent for stroke treatment and as a carrier for delivery of NA1, a neuroprotective peptide. We show that intravenous administration of A-BAM NPs effectively improved recovery from stroke and its efficacy was further enhanced when NA1 was encapsulated. Due to their multifunctionality and significant efficacy, we anticipate that A-BAM NPs have the potential to be translated both as a therapeutic agent and as a drug carrier to improve the treatment of stroke.

573	55-40-3	WIKIPEDIA	"Methyldopa, also known as α-methyl-L-DOPA and sold under the brand name Aldomet among others, is a medication used for high blood pressure. It is one of the preferred treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy. For other types of high blood pressure including very high blood pressure resulting in symptoms other medications are typically preferred. It can be given by mouth or injection into a vein. Onset of effects is around 5 hours and they last about a day. Common side effects include sleepiness. More severe side effects include red blood cell breakdown, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Methyldopa is in the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist family of medication. It works by stimulating the brain to decrease the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Methyldopa was discovered in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Methyldopa is used in the clinical treatment of the following disorders: Hypertension (or high blood pressure) Gestational hypertension (or pregnancy-induced hypertension) and pre-eclampsia. == Side effects == Methyldopa is capable of inducing a number of adverse side effects, which range from mild to severe. Nevertheless, they are generally mild when the dose is less than 1 gram per day. Side effects may include: Psychological Depression or even suicidal ideation, as well as nightmares Apathy or anhedonia, as well as dysphoria Anxiety, especially of the social anxiety variant Decreased alertness, awareness, and wakefulness Impaired attention, focus, and concentration Decreased desire, drive, and motivation Fatigue or lethargy or malaise or lassitude Sedation or drowsiness or somnolence or sleepiness Agitation or restlessness Cognitive and memory impairment Derealization or depersonalization, as well as mild psychosis Sexual dysfunction including impaired libido, desire, and drive Physiological Dizziness, lightheadedness, or vertigo Miosis or pupil constriction Xerostomia or dry mouth Gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea or constipation Headache or migraine Myalgia or muscle aches, arthralgia or joint pain, or paresthesia (""pins and needles"") Restless legs syndrome (RLS) Parkinsonian symptoms such as muscle tremors, rigidity, hypokinesia, or balance or postural instability Akathisia, ataxia, dyskinesia as well as even tardive dyskinesia, or dystonia Bell's palsy or facial paralysis Sexual dysfunction consisting of impaired erectile dysfunction or anorgasmia Hyperprolactinemia or excess prolactin, gynecomastia/breast enlargement in males, or amenorrhoea or absence of menstrual cycles in females Bradycardia or decreased heart rate Hypotension or decreased blood pressure (though this may also be considered a therapeutic benefit) Orthostatic hypotension (also known as postural hypotension) Hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, or liver dysfunction or damage Pancreatitis or inflammation of the pancreas Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia or deficiency in red blood cells (RBCs) Myelotoxicity or bone marrow suppression, potentially leading to thrombocytopenia or blood platelet deficiency or leukopenia or white blood cell (WBC) deficiency Hypersensitivity such as lupus erythematosus, myocarditis, or pericarditis Lichenoid reactions such as skin lesions or rashes Pallor === Rebound/withdrawal === Rebound hypertension via withdrawal on account of tolerance upon the abrupt discontinuation of methyldopa has been reported. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of action of methyldopa is not fully clear. Although it is a centrally acting sympathomimetic, it does not block reuptake or transporters. It may reduce the dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission in the peripheral nervous system and it indirectly affects norepinephrine (noradrenaline) synthesis. Methyldopa acts on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which are found on the pre synaptic nerve terminal. This inhibits the synthesis of norepinephrine by inhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase. The S-enantiomer of methyldopa is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (LAAD), which converts L-DOPA into dopamine. L-DOPA can cross the blood brain barrier and thus methyldopa may have similar effects. LAAD converts it into alpha-methyldopamine, a false prescursor to norepinephrine, which in turn reduces synthesis of norepinephrine in the vesicles. Dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) converts alpha-methyldopamine into alpha-methylnorepinephrine, which is an agonist of the presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptor causing inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Methyldopa has been found to be a monoamine depleting agent. == Pharmacokinetics == Maximum decrease in blood pressure occurs 4-6 hours after oral dosage. The half-life of methyldopa is 105 minutes. Methyldopa exhibits variable absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized in the liver and intestines and is excreted in urine. == History == When methyldopa was first introduced, it was the mainstay of antihypertensive treatment, but its use has declined on account of relatively severe adverse side effects, with increased use of other safer and more tolerable agents such as alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Additionally, it has yet to be associated with reducing adverse cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke, or overall all-cause mortality reduction in clinical trials. Nonetheless, one of methyldopa's still current indications is in the management of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), as it is relatively safe in pregnancy compared to many other antihypertensives which may affect the fetus. == See also == Difluoromethyldopa D-DOPA (dextrodopa) L-DOPA (levodopa; trade names Sinemet, Pharmacopa, Atamet, Stalevo, Madopar, Prolopa, etc.) L-DOPS (droxidopa) Dopamine (Intropan, Inovan, Revivan, Rivimine, Dopastat, Dynatra, etc.) Norepinephrine (noradrenaline; Levophed, etc.) Epinephrine (adrenaline; Adrenalin, EpiPed, Twinject, etc.) MK-872 HCl salt: [55943-64-1] α-Methyltyrosine α-Methyl-5-hydroxytryptophan == References == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}

615	N-(1,3-dihydroxyoctadec-4-en-2-yl)octadecanamide	PUBMED	 Vesicles, recently claimed as drug delivery carriers, were prepared by taking advantage of an electrostatic interaction between the carboxylic groups of fatty acids (FAs) and the amino groups of N-[3-(Dimethylamino)propyl]-Octadecanamide (DMAPODA). The study is to find out the effect of FAs' chain length on physicochemical properties of vesicles. Decanoic acid (DA), myristic acid (MA), stearic acid (SA) and behenic acid (BA) were used as FAs. Vesicles composed of them and DMAPODA were studied about formation on microscope, calorimetric analysis, size and zeta potential. On microphotographs, all of FAs could form vesicles when mixed with DMAPODA in an equi-molar ratio. However, DA/DMAPODA vesicles were disintegrated during the homogenization. Due to the asymmetry of DA/DMAPODA associate, it seems to hardly form a stable and well-packed bilayer. On thermograms, the vesicles exhibited one strong peak, indicating that FAs can be homogeneously mixed with the cationic amphiphile. The sizes of the four kinds of vesicles suspended in an aqueous solution (final pH 7.5) were in the same order (hundreds of nanometer) on microphotographs. But, on a light scattering machine, the mean size of MA/DMAPODA vesicle was measured to be much greater than those of the other vesicles, possibly because of the low absolute value of the zeta potential. In addition, the medium pH value had a significant effect on the size of BA/DMAPODA vesicle possibly because the zeta potential was strongly dependent on the pH value. FAs' chain length would affect the physicochemical properties of vesicles composed of them and DMAPODA. The integrity and properties of mycolic acid (MA) antigens integrated into a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of N-(2-mercaptoethyl)octadecanamide, (MEODA), on a gold electrode have been interrogated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS data showed that Au-MEODA and Au-MEODA-MA behave as microelectrode arrays, with pinholes acting as the microelectrodes that permit electron transport between a redox-active probe in solution and the underlying gold surface. The average radii of the pinholes (r(a)) and half the distance between the centers of the neighbouring pinholes (r(b)), were estimated from EIS using the pore size model, and discussed. Anti-MA antibodies present in a tuberculosis (TB)-infected patient (co-infected with HIV) strongly interact with Au-MEODA-MA showing a rather compact and stable bio-complex structure that is virtually defect-free. The electrochemical impedimetric properties associated with the ability of the Au-MEODA-MA to discriminate between TB positive and negative human sera are also discussed. We prove that the Au-MEODA and Au-MEODA-MA electrodes, as well as the MA-anti-MA antibody interactions, are characterized with time-constant dispersion, typical of microstructures with grain/grain boundary phases. These crucial physico-electrochemical insights into the behaviour of surface-confined MA should provide a useful basis for the design and development of a potential impedimetric immunosensing platform for active tuberculosis.

In this article, we highlight the application of this versatile method in synthetic approaches towards substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs).

These approaches were divided into three key steps: aromatization (which finalises the CPP), macrocyclization (the formation of a strain-reduced macrocycle) and the [2+2+2] CA. Based on this analysis the strategies were categorised into four classes based on which task the [2+2+2] CA fulfills.

In this article, we highlight the application of this versatile method in synthetic approaches towards substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs). The [2+2+2] CA can take over different tasks within the synthesis depending on the targeted CPP. These approaches were divided into three key steps: aromatization (which finalises the CPP), macrocyclization (the formation of a strain-reduced macrocycle) and the [2+2+2] CA. Based on this analysis the strategies were categorised into four classes based on which task the [2+2+2] CA fulfills. We point out the benefits and drawbacks of each synthesic strategy and summarize our findings to provide the reader with an easy insight into this research field.	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -2.618001e-05}

608	Proposed tyr-c3:0	PUBMED	" Working memory is the fundamental function by which we break free from reflexive input-output reactions to gain control over our own thoughts. It has two types of mechanisms: online maintenance of information and its volitional or executive control. Classic models proposed persistent spiking for maintenance but have not explicitly addressed executive control. We review recent theoretical and empirical studies that suggest updates and additions to the classic model. Synaptic weight changes between sparse bursts of spiking strengthen working memory maintenance. Executive control acts via interplay between network oscillations in gamma (30-100 Hz) in superficial cortical layers (layers 2 and 3) and alpha and beta (10-30 Hz) in deep cortical layers (layers 5 and 6). Deep-layer alpha and beta are associated with top-down information and inhibition. It regulates the flow of bottom-up sensory information associated with superficial layer gamma. We propose that interactions between different rhythms in distinct cortical layers underlie working memory maintenance and its volitional control. Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) response criteria have been established and were updated in 2023 for MRI-based response evaluation of diffuse gliomas in clinical trials. In addition, PET-based imaging with amino acid tracers is increasingly considered for disease monitoring in both clinical practice and clinical trials. So far, a standardised framework defining timepoints for baseline and follow-up investigations and response evaluation criteria for PET imaging of diffuse gliomas has not been established. Therefore, in this Policy Review, we propose a set of criteria for response assessment based on amino acid PET imaging in clinical trials enrolling participants with diffuse gliomas as defined in the 2021 WHO classification of tumours of the central nervous system. These proposed PET RANO criteria provide a conceptual framework that facilitates the structured implementation of PET imaging into clinical research and, ultimately, clinical routine. To this end, the PET RANO 1.0 criteria are intended to encourage specific investigations of amino acid PET imaging of gliomas. The new field of primate archaeology investigates the technological behavior and material record of nonhuman primates, providing valuable comparative data on our understanding of human technological evolution. Yet, paralleling hominin archaeology, the field is largely biased toward the analysis of lithic artifacts. While valuable comparative data have been gained through an examination of extant nonhuman primate tool use and its archaeological record, focusing on this one single aspect provides limited insights. It is therefore necessary to explore to what extent other non-technological activities, such as non-tool aided feeding, traveling, social behaviors or ritual displays, leave traces that could be detected in the archaeological record. Here we propose four new areas of investigation which we believe have been largely overlooked by primate archaeology and that are crucial to uncovering the full archaeological potential of the primate behavioral repertoire, including that of our own: (1) Plant technology; (2) Archaeology beyond technology; (3) Landscape archaeology; and (4) Primate cultural heritage. We discuss each theme in the context of the latest developments and challenges, as well as propose future directions. Developing a more ""inclusive"" primate archaeology will not only benefit the study of primate evolution in its own right but will aid conservation efforts by increasing our understanding of changes in primate-environment interactions over time."
