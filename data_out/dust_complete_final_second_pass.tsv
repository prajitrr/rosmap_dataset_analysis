0	Carbamazepine	WIKIPEDIA	"Carbamazepine, sold under the brand name Tegretol among others, is an anticonvulsant medication used in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. It is used as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia along with other medications and as a second-line agent in bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine appears to work as well as phenytoin and valproate for focal and generalized seizures. It is not effective for absence or myoclonic seizures. Carbamazepine was discovered in 1953 by Swiss chemist Walter Schindler. It was first marketed in 1962. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2020, it was the 185th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. Photoswitchable analogues of carbamazepine have been developed to control its pharmacological activity locally and on demand using light (photopharmacology), with the purpose of reducing the adverse systemic effects of the drug. One of these light-regulated compounds (carbadiazocine, based on a bridged azobenzene or diazocine) has been shown to produce analgesia with noninvasive illumination in vivo in a rat model of neuropathic pain. == Medical uses == Carbamazepine is typically used for the treatment of seizure disorders and neuropathic pain. It is used off-label as a second-line treatment for bipolar disorder and in combination with an antipsychotic in some cases of schizophrenia when treatment with a conventional antipsychotic alone has failed. However, evidence does not support its usage for schizophrenia. It is not effective for absence seizures or myoclonic seizures. Although carbamazepine may have a similar effectiveness (as measured by people continuing to use a medication) and efficacy (as measured by the medicine reducing seizure recurrence and improving remission) when compared to phenytoin and valproate, choice of medication should be evaluated on an individual basis as further research is needed to determine which medication is most helpful for people with newly-onset seizures. In the United States, carbamazepine is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy (including partial seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and mixed seizures), and trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine is the only medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. As of 2014, a controlled release formulation was available for which there is tentative evidence showing fewer side effects and unclear evidence with regard to whether there is a difference in efficacy. It has also been shown to improve symptoms of ""typewriter tinnitus"", a type of tinnitus caused by the neurovascular compression of the cochleovestibular nerve. == Adverse effects == In the US, the label for carbamazepine contains warnings concerning: effects on the body's production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets: rarely, there are major effects of aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis reported and more commonly, there are minor changes such as decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, but these do not progress to more serious problems. increased risks of suicide increased risks of hyponatremia and SIADH risk of seizures, if the person stops taking the drug abruptly risks to the fetus in women who are pregnant, specifically congenital malformations like spina bifida, and developmental disorders. Pancreatitis Hepatitis Dizziness Bone marrow suppression Stevens–Johnson syndrome Common adverse effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and migraines, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and/or constipation. Alcohol use while taking carbamazepine may lead to enhanced depression of the central nervous system. Less common side effects may include increased risk of seizures in people with mixed seizure disorders, abnormal heart rhythms, blurry or double vision. Also, rare case reports of an auditory side effect have been made, whereby patients perceive sounds about a semitone lower than previously; this unusual side effect is usually not noticed by most people, and disappears after the person stops taking carbamazepine. === Pharmacogenetics === Serious skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) due to carbamazepine therapy are more common in people with a particular human leukocyte antigen gene-variant (allele), HLA-B*1502. Odds ratios for the development of SJS or TEN in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied. HLA-B*1502 occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele has been shown to be a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions, such as the DRESS form of severe cutaneous reactions, to carbamazepine among Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Europeans. It is suggested that carbamazepine acts as a potent antigen that binds to the antigen-presenting area of HLA-B*1502 alike, triggering an everlasting activation signal on immature CD8-T cells, thus resulting in widespread cytotoxic reactions like SJS/TEN. == Interactions == Carbamazepine has a potential for drug interactions. Drugs that decrease breaking down of carbamazepine or otherwise increase its levels include erythromycin, cimetidine, propoxyphene, and calcium channel blockers. Grapefruit juice raises the bioavailability of carbamazepine by inhibiting the enzyme CYP3A4 in the gut wall and in the liver. Lower levels of carbamazepine are seen when administered with phenobarbital, phenytoin, or primidone, which can result in breakthrough seizure activity. Valproic acid and valnoctamide both inhibit microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide into inactive metabolites. By inhibiting mEH, valproic acid and valnoctamide cause a build-up of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion. Carbamazepine, as an inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, may increase clearance of many drugs, decreasing their concentration in the blood to subtherapeutic levels and reducing their desired effects. Drugs that are more rapidly metabolized with carbamazepine include warfarin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, theophylline, valproic acid, many benzodiazepines, and methadone. Carbamazepine also increases the metabolism of the hormones in birth control pills and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Carbamazepine is a sodium channel blocker. It binds preferentially to voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactive conformation, which prevents repetitive and sustained firing of an action potential. Carbamazepine has effects on serotonin systems but the relevance to its antiseizure effects is uncertain. There is evidence that it is a serotonin releasing agent and possibly even a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It has been suggested that carbamazepine can also block voltage-gated calcium channels, which will reduce neurotransmitter release. === Pharmacokinetics === Carbamazepine is relatively slowly but practically completely absorbed after administration by mouth. Highest concentrations in the blood plasma are reached after 4 to 24 hours depending on the dosage form. Slow release tablets result in about 15% lower absorption and 25% lower peak plasma concentrations than ordinary tablets, as well as in less fluctuation of the concentration, but not in significantly lower minimum concentrations. In the circulation, carbamazepine itself comprises 20 to 30% of total residues. The remainder is in the form of metabolites; 70 to 80% of residues is bound to plasma proteins. Concentrations in breast milk are 25 to 60% of those in the blood plasma. Carbamazepine itself is not pharmacologically active. It is activated, mainly by CYP3A4, to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, which is solely responsible for the drug's anticonvulsant effects. The epoxide is then inactivated by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) to carbamazepine-trans-10,11-diol and further to its glucuronides. Other metabolites include various hydroxyl derivatives and carbamazepine-N-glucuronide. The plasma half-life is about 35 to 40 hours when carbamazepine is given as single dose, but it is a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and the plasma half-life shortens to about 12 to 17 hours when it is given repeatedly. The half-life can be further shortened to 9–10 hours by other enzyme inducers such as phenytoin or phenobarbital. About 70% are excreted via the urine, almost exclusively in form of its metabolites, and 30% via the faeces. == History == Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of Novartis) in Basel, Switzerland, in 1953. It was first marketed as a drug to treat epilepsy in Switzerland in 1963 under the brand name Tegretol; its use for trigeminal neuralgia (formerly known as tic douloureux) was introduced at the same time. It has been used as an anticonvulsant and antiepileptic in the United Kingdom since 1965, and has been approved in the United States since 1968. Carbamazepine was studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s. == Society and culture == === Environmental impact === Carbamazepine and its bio-transformation products have been detected in wastewater treatment plant effluent: 224 and in streams receiving treated wastewater. Field and laboratory studies have been conducted to understand the accumulation of carbamazepine in food plants grown in soil treated with sludge, which vary with respect to the concentrations of carbamazepine present in sludge and in the concentrations of sludge in the soil. Taking into account only studies that used concentrations commonly found in the environment, a 2014 review concluded that ""the accumulation of carbamazepine into plants grown in soil amended with biosolids poses a de minimis risk to human health according to the approach."": 227 === Brand names === Carbamazepine is available worldwide under many brand names including Tegretol. == Research == == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Carbamazepine"".

1	Spiroxamine	PUBMED	 The conclusions of the EFSA following the peer review of the initial risk assessment carried out by the competent authority of the rapporteur Member State, Germany, for the pesticide active substance spiroxamine are reported. The context of the peer review was that requested by the European Commission following the submission and evaluation of confirmatory ecotoxicology data. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of spiroxamine as a fungicide on grapes, wheat, triticale, rye, barley and oats. The reliable end points concluded as being appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, derived from the available studies and literature in the dossier peer reviewed, are presented. The dissipation dynamic and residues of spiroxamine in open-field-grown strawberries were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Spiroxamine application was performed according to Egyptian good agricultural practices recommendation. A QuEChERS-based extraction method along with direct analysis with an LC-MS/MS analytical method were optimized and validated, and the specificity of the techniques used was considered satisfactory. Good linearity (R Dissipation of the fungicide spiroxamine in grapes of two vine varieties, Roditis and Cabernet Sauvignon, exposed to field treatments was evaluated. Vines of a grape vineyard located in central Greece were sprayed once or twice with a commercial formulation of the fungicide at 30 g a.i./hL. Residues in grapes, must, and wine were determined by gas chromatography/IT-MS after extraction with cyclohexane-dichloromethane (9:1), with a limit of quantitation 0.02 mg/kg in grapes and 0.012 mg/kg in wine. Under field conditions, spiroxamine dissipation on grapes was faster during the first 2 weeks and then slower to the sixth week. About 7 days after application, half of the initial spiroxamine concentration remained on the grapes; the respective proportion at 42 days was about 10%. At 14 and 35 days, residues were lower than 0.44 and 0.22 mg/kg, respectively, values below the maximum residue levels set by the European Union (1 mg/kg). Spiroxamine residues transferred from grapes into the must and through the vinification process into the wine were also studied. Mean transfer factors of 0.26 and 0.55 were found from grapes into wine for the wines obtained without maceration and with maceration, respectively. Residues in wine, prepared from grapes with a spiroxamine content of 0.11-0.20 mg/kg, varied from <0.026 to 0.09 mg/kg. Spiroxamine diastereomer B was found to dissipate slower than diastereomer A in the field as well as during the vinification process.

2	Piperyline	PUBMED	 Amide alkaloidsare typical constituents in plants of the Piperaceae family. Most of the pharmacological properties of Piper nigrum L. are attributed to the major amide alkaloid, piperine. Piperyline (PIPE) is a further amide alkaloid that has been isolated from P. nigrum. This study was performed to examine the biological effects of PIPE on pre-osteoblasts and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We investigated the effects of PIPE in MC3T3E-1 cells, which are widely used for studying osteoblast behavior in in vitro cell systems. We evaluated cell viability based on the MTT assay, apoptosis by TUNEL staining, adhesion and migration by cell adhesion and migration assays, and osteoblast differentiation by alkaline phosphatase activity and staining. Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses were used to investigate cell signaling pathways. We found that at concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 μM, PIPE inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in pre-osteoblasts, which was accompanied by the upregulation of apoptotic proteins but downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. In contrast, PIPE had no appreciable effect on the autophagy pathway. Nevertheless, PIPE reduced cell adhesion and migration via the inactivation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Src)/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases, and also promoted the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 levels. Furthermore, at concentrations of 10 and 30 μM, PIPE suppressed osteoblast differentiation, as indicated by reductions in alkaline phosphatase staining and activity. In addition, PIPE reduced the protein levels of phospho-Smad1/5/8 and runt-related transcription factor 2, and the mRNA levels of osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin. The findings of this study indicate that PIPE has biological effects associated with cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and osteoblast differentiation, and suggest a potential role for this alkaloid in the treatment of bone diseases.

5	Praziquantel	WIKIPEDIA	"Praziquantel (PZQ), sold under the brandname Biltricide among others, is a medication used to treat a number of types of parasitic worm infections in mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish. In humans specifically, it is used to treat schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, tapeworm infections, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, paragonimiasis, fasciolopsiasis, and fasciolosis. It should not be used for worm infections of the eye. It is taken by mouth. Side effects in humans may include poor coordination, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and allergic reactions. While it may be used during pregnancy, it is not recommended for use during breastfeeding. Praziquantel is in the anthelmintic class of medications. It works partly by affecting the function of the worm's sucker. Praziquantel was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Praziquantel is used to treat diseases caused by infection with several types of internal/gastrointestinal, and external parasites, including: Hydatid disease caused by infection of various organs with larval stages of tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus Cysticercosis caused by infection of the brain and/or muscles with the eggs and larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium (though it has been judged less effective than albendazole in treatment of neurocysticercosis) Taeniasis caused by intestinal infection with Taenia saginata and Taenia solium Diphyllobothriasis caused by intestinal infection with Diphyllobothrium latum Hymenolepiasis caused by Hymenolepis nana and Hymenolepis diminuta Bertielliasis caused by intestinal infection with Bertiella studeri In dogs and cats, whose gastrointestinal tracts are infected with the tapeworms Dipylidium caninum or Taenia taeniaeformis, respectively; praziquantel is also often used in fixed combination with pyrantel embonate against the roundworms (ascarids): Toxocara cati and Toxascaris leonina. Praziquantel is also effective against Echinococcus multilocularis. Schistosomiasis caused by trematodes of the genus Schistosoma: As of 2005, praziquantel is the primary treatment for human schistosomiasis, for which it is usually effective in a single dose. Clonorchiasis brought on by the Chinese liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis Opisthorchiasis brought on by the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini and Opisthorchis felineus Paragonimiasis caused by infection with lung flukes, mostly of the species Paragonimus westermani Fasciolopsiasis caused by the giant intestinal fluke Fasciolopsis buski Echinostomiasis caused by infection with intestinal flukes of the genus Echinostoma Metagonimiasis caused by infection with intestinal flukes of the genus Metagonimus Heterophyiasis caused by the intestinal fluke Heterophyes heterophyes == Side effects == The majority of side effects develop due to the release of the contents of the parasites as they are killed and the consequent host immune reaction. The heavier the parasite burden, the heavier and more frequent the side effects normally are. Central nervous system (CNS): Frequently occurring side effects are dizziness, headache, and malaise. Drowsiness, somnolence, fatigue, and vertigo have also been seen. Almost all patients with cerebral cysticercosis experience CNS side effects related to the cell-death of the parasites (headache, worsening of pre-existing neurological problems, seizures, arachnoiditis, and meningism). These side effects may be life-threatening and can be reduced by coadministration of corticosteroids. All patients with cerebral cysticercosis are strongly recommended to be hospitalized during treatment. Gastrointestinal tract: About 90% of all patients have abdominal pain or cramps with or without nausea and vomiting. Diarrhea may develop and may be severe with colic. Sweating, fever, and sometimes bloody stools may occur together with diarrhea. Liver: Asymptomatic and transient increases of liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are noted frequently (up to 27%). No case of symptomatic liver damage has been seen so far. Sensitivity reactions: Urticaria, rash, pruritus and eosinophilia in white blood cell counts Other locations/body as a whole: Lower back pain, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, sweating, various cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension === Pregnancy === The WHO states praziquantel is safe during pregnancy (although does not recommend use during the first trimester). Animal studies have failed to reveal evidence of fetal harm. Praziquantel is effective in reducing schistosomiasis during pregnancy. Another trial found that treatment with praziquantel did not increase the rates of low birthweight, fetal death, or congenital anomalies. == Drug interactions == The antibiotic rifampicin decreases plasma concentrations of praziquantel. Carbamazepine and phenytoin are reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Chloroquine also reduces its bioavailability. The drug cimetidine heightens praziquantel bioavailability. == Mechanism of action == The drug's mode of action is not exactly known at present, but experimental evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites' muscle, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites. Another hypothesis regarding the mechanism of action is that it interferes with adenosine uptake in worms. This effect may have therapeutical relevance given that the schistosome, as the Taenia and the Echinococcus (other praziquantel-sensitive parasites), is unable to synthesize purines, such as adenosine, de novo. Bayer's Animal Health Division website states, ""Praziquantel is active against cestodes (tapeworms). Praziquantel is absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the bile. Upon entering the digestive tract from the bile, cestocidal activity is exhibited. Following exposure to praziquantel, the tapeworm loses its ability to resist digestion by the mammalian host. Because of this, whole tapeworms, including the scolices (plural of ""scolex""), are very rarely passed after administration of praziquantel. In many instances, only disintegrated and partially digested pieces of tapeworms will be seen in the stool. The majority of tapeworms are digested and are not found in the feces."" Praziquantel is administered as a racemate, but only the (R)-enantiomer is biologically active; the enantiomers may be separated using a resolution of an amine obtained from praziquantel. == Pharmacokinetics == Praziquantel is well absorbed (about 80%) from the gastrointestinal tract. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, only a relatively small amount enters systemic circulation. Praziquantel has a serum half-life of 0.8 to 1.5 hours in adults with normal renal and liver function. Metabolites have a half-life of 4 to 5 hours. In patients with significantly impaired liver function (Child-Pugh score B and C), the serum half-life is increased to 3 to 8 hours. Praziquantel and its metabolites are mainly excreted renally; within 24 h after a single oral dose, 70 to 80% is found in urine, but less than 0.1% as the unchanged drug. Praziquantel is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 pathway via CYP3A4. Agents that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 such as phenytoin, rifampin, and azole antifungals will affect the metabolism of praziquantel. Praziquantel has a particularly dramatic effect on patients with schistosomiasis. Studies of those treated have shown that within six months of receiving a dose of praziquantel, up to 90% of the damage done to internal organs due to schistosomiasis infection can be reversed. == History == Praziquantel was developed in the laboratories for parasitological research of Bayer AG and Merck KGaA in Germany (Elberfeld and Darmstadt) in the mid-1970s. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Biltricide (Bayer) Tablets (for human use) Cesol (Merck) Tablets Cestoved (Vedco) both tablets and injectable for veterinary use Cysticide (Merck) Tablets Distocide (Shin Poong Pharm.

6	Terbinafine	WIKIPEDIA	Terbinafine is an antifungal medication used to treat pityriasis versicolor, fungal nail infections, and ringworm including jock itch and athlete's foot. It is either taken by mouth or applied to the skin as a cream or ointment. The cream and ointment should not be used for fungal nail infections. Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, diarrhea, headache, cough, rash, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. Liver injury is, however, unusual. Oral use during pregnancy is not typically recommended. The cream and ointment may result in itchiness but are generally well tolerated. Terbinafine is in the allylamines family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to synthesize ergosterol. It appears to result in fungal cell death. Terbinafine was discovered in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 255th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Terbinafine is mainly effective on molds of the order Onygenales and some yeasts in the genus Candida. As a cream or powder, it is used topically for superficial skin infections such as jock itch (tinea cruris), athlete's foot (tinea pedis), and other types of ringworm (tinea corporis). Tablets by mouth are often prescribed for the treatment of onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection, typically by a dermatophyte or Candida species. Fungal nail infections are located deep under the nail in the cuticle to which topically applied treatments are unable to penetrate in sufficient amounts. The tablets may, rarely, cause hepatotoxicity, so patients are warned of this and may be monitored with liver function tests. Alternatives to oral administration have been studied. Terbinafine may induce or exacerbate subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Persons with lupus erythematosus should first discuss possible risks with their doctor before initiation of therapy. == Side effects == Many side effects and adverse drug reactions have been reported with oral terbinafine hydrochloride, possibly due to its extensive biodistribution and the often extended durations involved in antifungal treatment (longer than two months). A comprehensive list of adverse events associated with terbinafine use includes: Gastrointestinal problems: Diarrhea, constipation, nausea, fullness, abdominal pain, indigestion, dyspepsia, gastritis, cholestasis, flatulence, altered stool colour, abdominal muscular pain Central nervous system or neurological problems: Headaches, dizziness, vertigo, light-headedness, decreased concentration levels, paraesthesia (pins and needles) Hepatic problems: Raised liver enzyme levels, liver inflammation (hepatitis), liver damage, liver failure Immune system problems: Decreased white blood cell counts including pancytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and neutropenia, autoimmune reactions such as lupus erythematosus Psychological problems: Depression, anxiety, insomnia, increased or unusual dream activity, malaise Sensory problems: Complete loss of taste (ageusia), decreased taste (hypogeusia) and distorted taste (dysgeusia), often involving a metallic taste sensation and dry mouth, visual disturbances including blurred vision, green vision and double vision. In extremely rare cases, the loss or impairment of taste is permanent Skin problems: Rashes, hives (urticaria), skin irritation, itching, jaundice, Stevens–Johnson syndrome Other side effects: Fatigue, increased heart rate (tachycardia), hair loss (alopecia), decreased red blood cell count (anemia), muscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia) In 2015, physicians reported that a patient with an MTHFR enzyme mutation (specifically the C677T variant) had developed an adverse reaction to terbinafine (Lamisil) (headache, fatigue, and dizziness). Genetic testing revealed the MTHFR C677T mutation. It was noted that Lamisil interferes with the methylation cycle and that this can cause side effects in individuals with the MTHFR C677T mutation. == Pharmacology == Like other allylamines, terbinafine inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of squalene to lanosterol. In fungi, lanosterol is then converted to ergosterol; in humans, lanosterol becomes cholesterol. However, as fungi and animals diverged around 1.1 billion years ago - there is enough difference in this enzyme that terbinafine preferentially binds fungal squalene epoxidase, making it selective for inhibiting ergosterol production in fungi without significantly affecting cholesterol production in mammals. This is thought to fatally disrupt the fungal cell membrane. Terbinafine is highly lipophilic and tends to accumulate in hair, skin, nails, and fat cells. This accumulation results in therapeutic levels of terbinafine even after 80 days following one week treatment of 250 mg/day. Different dosing schedules have been proposed such as 500 mg/day for one week or 250 mg/day for two weeks each followed by a drug-free period of two or three weeks, totaling 3 months of treatment including the drug-free periods. Such intermittent dosing schedules appear to be as effective as continuous regimens. == Chemistry == Terbinafine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol and dichloromethane, soluble in ethanol, and slightly soluble in water. Terbinafine is produced from olefin metathesis of 1,3-dichloropropene and neohexene followed by reaction with N-methyl-1-naphthalenemethanamine. Despite its name it does not contain terbium. == History == Terbinafine first became available in Europe in 1991 and in the United States in 1996. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first generic versions of prescription Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) tablets. The remaining patent or exclusivity for Lamisil expired on June 30, 2007. On September 28, 2007, the FDA stated that terbinafine is now approved for use by children age four and up. The antifungal granules can be sprinkled on a child's food to treat scalp fungus. In the United States the price in 1999 was $547 for a 12-week course; this fell to $10 by 2015, after the patent had expired. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Terbinafine is sold in India as Terboderm by Omega Pharma and Tyza (Abbott Healthcare). Lamisil in Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Egypt, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela Corbinal and Terbisil in Turkey, Pakistan, Undofen in Poland. Another alternate is Terbistad (Stada Arzneimittel). As a generic oral medication, it is sold as Sebifin, Tinasil, Terbisil, Terbicor, and Tamsil in Australia, whilst the generic topical medication is sold there as SolvEasyTinea and Tamsil. It is also available as a generic medication in the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Switzerland, Brazil, Mexico, Canada and France. In India, terbinafine hydrochloride is available in topical form under the brand names Triabin by Medley Pharmaceuticals, Sebifin (Sun Pharma), Zimig (GSK Pharma) and mycoCeaze (Progreś Laboratories).

Other names include Terbinaforce (Mankind Pharma) and Tafine (Deurali Janta Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd.) Turbo (Apex Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd) in Nepal. The topical form is sold as Lamisil AT in the United States. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
8	Caffeine	WIKIPEDIA	"Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class and is the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance globally. It is mainly used for its eugeroic (wakefulness promoting), ergogenic (physical performance-enhancing), or nootropic (cognitive-enhancing) properties. Caffeine acts by blocking binding of adenosine at a number of adenosine receptor types, inhibiting the centrally depressant effects of adenosine and enhancing the release of acetylcholine. Caffeine has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of adenosine, which allows it to bind and block its receptors. Caffeine also increases cyclic AMP levels through nonselective inhibition of phosphodiesterase, increases calcium release from intracellular stores, and antagonizes GABA receptors, although these mechanisms typically occur at concentrations beyond usual human consumption. Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline purine, a methylxanthine alkaloid, and is chemically related to the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). It is found in the seeds, fruits, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to Africa, East Asia and South America and helps to protect them against herbivores and from competition by preventing the germination of nearby seeds, as well as encouraging consumption by select animals such as honey bees. The best-known source of caffeine is the coffee bean, the seed of the Coffea plant. People may drink beverages containing caffeine to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve cognitive performance. To make these drinks, caffeine is extracted by steeping the plant product in water, a process called infusion. Caffeine-containing drinks, such as coffee, tea, and cola, are consumed globally in high volumes. In 2020, almost 10 million tonnes of coffee beans were consumed globally. Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike most other psychoactive substances, caffeine remains largely unregulated and legal in nearly all parts of the world. Caffeine is also an outlier as its use is seen as socially acceptable in most cultures with it even being encouraged. Caffeine has both positive and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent the premature infant breathing disorders bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Some people experience sleep disruption or anxiety if they consume caffeine, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal; some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit caffeine to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less. Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence – associated with withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness, headache, and irritability – when an individual stops using caffeine after repeated daily intake. Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use (i.e., these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use). Caffeine is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as generally recognized as safe. Toxic doses, over 10 grams per day for an adult, are much higher than the typical dose of under 500 milligrams per day. The European Food Safety Authority reported that up to 400 mg of caffeine per day (around 5.7 mg/kg of body mass per day) does not raise safety concerns for non-pregnant adults, while intakes up to 200 mg per day for pregnant and lactating women do not raise safety concerns for the fetus or the breast-fed infants. A cup of coffee contains 80–175 mg of caffeine, depending on what ""bean"" (seed) is used, how it is roasted, and how it is prepared (e.g., drip, percolation, or espresso). Thus it requires roughly 50–100 ordinary cups of coffee to reach the toxic dose. However, pure powdered caffeine, which is available as a dietary supplement, can be lethal in tablespoon-sized amounts. == Uses == === Medical === Caffeine is used for both prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. It may improve weight gain during therapy and reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy as well as reduce language and cognitive delay. On the other hand, subtle long-term side effects are possible. Caffeine is used as a primary treatment for apnea of prematurity, but not prevention. It is also used for orthostatic hypotension treatment. Some people use caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee or tea to try to treat their asthma. Evidence to support this practice is poor. It appears that caffeine in low doses improves airway function in people with asthma, increasing forced expiratory volume (FEV1) by 5% to 18% for up to four hours. The addition of caffeine (100–130 mg) to commonly prescribed pain relievers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen modestly improves the proportion of people who achieve pain relief. Consumption of caffeine after abdominal surgery shortens the time to recovery of normal bowel function and shortens length of hospital stay. Caffeine was formerly used as a second-line treatment for ADHD. It is considered less effective than methylphenidate or amphetamine but more so than placebo for children with ADHD. Children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD are more likely to consume caffeine, perhaps as a form of self-medication. === Enhancing performance === ==== Cognitive performance ==== Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that may reduce fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, wakefulness, concentration, and motor coordination. The amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance. The desired effects arise approximately one hour after consumption, and the desired effects of a moderate dose usually subside after about three or four hours. Caffeine can delay or prevent sleep and improves task performance during sleep deprivation. Shift workers who use caffeine make fewer mistakes that could result from drowsiness. Caffeine in a dose dependent manner increases alertness in both fatigued and normal individuals. A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2014 found that concurrent caffeine and L-theanine use has synergistic psychoactive effects that promote alertness, attention, and task switching; these effects are most pronounced during the first hour post-dose. ==== Physical performance ==== Caffeine is a proven ergogenic aid in humans. Caffeine improves athletic performance in aerobic (especially endurance sports) and anaerobic conditions. Moderate doses of caffeine (around 5 mg/kg) can improve sprint performance, cycling and running time trial performance, endurance (i.e., it delays the onset of muscle fatigue and central fatigue), and cycling power output. Caffeine increases basal metabolic rate in adults. Caffeine ingestion prior to aerobic exercise increases fat oxidation, particularly in persons with low physical fitness. Caffeine improves muscular strength and power, and may enhance muscular endurance. Caffeine also enhances performance on anaerobic tests. Caffeine consumption before constant load exercise is associated with reduced perceived exertion. While this effect is not present during exercise-to-exhaustion exercise, performance is significantly enhanced. This is congruent with caffeine reducing perceived exertion, because exercise-to-exhaustion should end at the same point of fatigue. Caffeine also improves power output and reduces time to completion in aerobic time trials, an effect positively (but not exclusively) associated with longer duration exercise. === Specific populations === ==== Adults ==== For the general population of healthy adults, Health Canada advises a daily intake of no more than 400 mg. This limit was found to be safe by a 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology. ==== Children ==== In healthy children, moderate caffeine intake under 400 mg produces effects that are ""modest and typically innocuous"". As early as six months old, infants can metabolize caffeine at the same rate as that of adults. Higher doses of caffeine (>400 mg) can cause physiological, psychological and behavioral harm, particularly for children with psychiatric or cardiac conditions. There is no evidence that coffee stunts a child's growth. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that caffeine consumption, particularly in the case of energy and sports drinks, is not appropriate for children and adolescents and should be avoided. This recommendation is based on a clinical report released by American Academy of Pediatrics in 2011 with a review of 45 publications from 1994 to 2011 and includes inputs from various stakeholders (Pediatricians, Committee on nutrition, Canadian Pediatric Society, Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Sports Medicine & Fitness committee, National Federations of High School Associations). For children age 12 and under, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 2.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Based on average body weights of children, this translates to the following age-based intake limits: ==== Adolescents ==== Health Canada has not developed advice for adolescents because of insufficient data. However, they suggest that daily caffeine intake for this age group be no more than 2.5 mg/kg body weight. This is because the maximum adult caffeine dose may not be appropriate for light-weight adolescents or for younger adolescents who are still growing. The daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight would not cause adverse health effects in the majority of adolescent caffeine consumers. This is a conservative suggestion since older and heavier-weight adolescents may be able to consume adult doses of caffeine without experiencing adverse effects. ==== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ==== The metabolism of caffeine is reduced in pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, and the half-life of caffeine during pregnancy can be increased up to 15 hours (as compared to 2.5 to 4.5 hours in non-pregnant adults). Evidence regarding the effects of caffeine on pregnancy and for breastfeeding are inconclusive. There is limited primary and secondary advice for, or against, caffeine use during pregnancy and its effects on the fetus or newborn. The UK Food Standards Agency has recommended that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake, out of prudence, to less than 200 mg of caffeine a day – the equivalent of two cups of instant coffee, or one and a half to two cups of fresh coffee. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200 mg per day in pregnant women. For women who breastfeed, are pregnant, or may become pregnant, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300 mg, or a little over two 8 oz (237 mL) cups of coffee. A 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology found evidence supporting that caffeine consumption up to 300 mg/day for pregnant women is generally not associated with adverse reproductive or developmental effect. There are conflicting reports in the scientific literature about caffeine use during pregnancy. A 2011 review found that caffeine during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations, miscarriage or growth retardation even when consumed in moderate to high amounts. Other reviews, however, concluded that there is some evidence that higher caffeine intake by pregnant women may be associated with a higher risk of giving birth to a low birth weight baby, and may be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss. A systematic review, analyzing the results of observational studies, suggests that women who consume large amounts of caffeine (greater than 300 mg/day) prior to becoming pregnant may have a higher risk of experiencing pregnancy loss. == Adverse effects == === Physiological === Caffeine in coffee and other caffeinated drinks can affect gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion. In postmenopausal women, high caffeine consumption can accelerate bone loss. Caffeine, alongside other factors such as stress and fatigue, can also increase the pressure in various muscles, including the eyelids. Acute ingestion of caffeine in large doses (at least 250–300 mg, equivalent to the amount found in 2–3 cups of coffee or 5–8 cups of tea) results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived of caffeine for a period of days or weeks. This increase is due to both a diuresis (increase in water excretion) and a natriuresis (increase in saline excretion); it is mediated via proximal tubular adenosine receptor blockade. The acute increase in urinary output may increase the risk of dehydration. However, chronic users of caffeine develop a tolerance to this effect and experience no increase in urinary output. === Psychological === Minor undesired symptoms from caffeine ingestion not sufficiently severe to warrant a psychiatric diagnosis are common and include mild anxiety, jitteriness, insomnia, increased sleep latency, and reduced coordination. Caffeine can have negative effects on anxiety disorders. According to a 2011 literature review, caffeine use may induce anxiety and panic disorders in people with Parkinson's disease. At high doses, typically greater than 300 mg, caffeine can both cause and worsen anxiety. For some people, discontinuing caffeine use can significantly reduce anxiety. In moderate doses, caffeine has been associated with reduced symptoms of depression and lower suicide risk. Two reviews indicate that increased consumption of coffee and caffeine may reduce the risk of depression. Some textbooks state that caffeine is a mild euphoriant, while others state that it is not a euphoriant. Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder is a subclass of the DSM-5 diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. === Reinforcement disorders === ==== Addiction ==== Whether caffeine can result in an addictive disorder depends on how addiction is defined. Compulsive caffeine consumption under any circumstances has not been observed, and caffeine is therefore not generally considered addictive. However, some diagnostic models, such as the ICDM-9 and ICD-10, include a classification of caffeine addiction under a broader diagnostic model. Some state that certain users can become addicted and therefore unable to decrease use even though they know there are negative health effects. Caffeine does not appear to be a reinforcing stimulus, and some degree of aversion may actually occur, with people preferring placebo over caffeine in a study on drug abuse liability published in an NIDA research monograph. Some state that research does not provide support for an underlying biochemical mechanism for caffeine addiction. Other research states it can affect the reward system. ""Caffeine addiction"" was added to the ICDM-9 and ICD-10. However, its addition was contested with claims that this diagnostic model of caffeine addiction is not supported by evidence. The American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 does not include the diagnosis of a caffeine addiction but proposes criteria for the disorder for more study. ==== Dependence and withdrawal ==== Withdrawal can cause mild to clinically significant distress or impairment in daily functioning. The frequency at which this occurs is self-reported at 11%, but in lab tests only half of the people who report withdrawal actually experience it, casting doubt on many claims of dependence. and most cases of caffeine withdrawal were 13% in the moderate sense. Moderately physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms may occur upon abstinence, with greater than 100 mg caffeine per day, although these symptoms last no longer than a day. Some symptoms associated with psychological dependence may also occur during withdrawal. The diagnostic criteria for caffeine withdrawal require a previous prolonged daily use of caffeine. Following 24 hours of a marked reduction in consumption, a minimum of 3 of these signs or symptoms is required to meet withdrawal criteria: difficulty concentrating, depressed mood/irritability, flu-like symptoms, headache, and fatigue. Additionally, the signs and symptoms must disrupt important areas of functioning and are not associated with effects of another condition. The ICD-11 includes caffeine dependence as a distinct diagnostic category, which closely mirrors the DSM-5's proposed set of criteria for ""caffeine-use disorder"". Caffeine use disorder refers to dependence on caffeine characterized by failure to control caffeine consumption despite negative physiological consequences. The APA, which published the DSM-5, acknowledged that there was sufficient evidence in order to create a diagnostic model of caffeine dependence for the DSM-5, but they noted that the clinical significance of the disorder is unclear. Due to this inconclusive evidence on clinical significance, the DSM-5 classifies caffeine-use disorder as a ""condition for further study"". Tolerance to the effects of caffeine occurs for caffeine-induced elevations in blood pressure and the subjective feelings of nervousness. Sensitization, the process whereby effects become more prominent with use, may occur for positive effects such as feelings of alertness and wellbeing. Tolerance varies for daily, regular caffeine users and high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200 mg/day spread throughout the day) have been shown to produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100 mg/day, such as a 6 oz (170 g) cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz (340 g) servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular caffeine users have the least caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not. === Risk of other diseases === A neuroprotective effect of caffeine against Alzheimer's disease and dementia is possible but the evidence is inconclusive. Caffeine may lessen the severity of acute mountain sickness if taken a few hours prior to attaining a high altitude. One meta analysis has found that caffeine consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Regular caffeine consumption may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and may slow the progression of Parkinson's disease. Caffeine increases intraocular pressure in those with glaucoma but does not appear to affect normal individuals. The DSM-5 also includes other caffeine-induced disorders consisting of caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, caffeine-induced sleep disorder and unspecified caffeine-related disorders. The first two disorders are classified under ""Anxiety Disorder"" and ""Sleep-Wake Disorder"" because they share similar characteristics. Other disorders that present with significant distress and impairment of daily functioning that warrant clinical attention but do not meet the criteria to be diagnosed under any specific disorders are listed under ""Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorders"". === Energy crash === Caffeine is reputed to cause a fall in energy several hours after drinking, but this is not well researched. == Overdose == Consumption of 1–1.5 grams (1,000–1,500 mg) per day is associated with a condition known as caffeinism. Caffeinism usually combines caffeine dependency with a wide range of unpleasant symptoms including nervousness, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and palpitations after caffeine use. Caffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system overstimulation known as caffeine intoxication, a clinically significant temporary condition that develops during, or shortly after, the consumption of caffeine. This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400–500 mg at a time). According to the DSM-5, caffeine intoxication may be diagnosed if five (or more) of the following symptoms develop after recent consumption of caffeine: restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, diuresis, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, rambling flow of thought and speech, tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia, periods of inexhaustibility, and psychomotor agitation. According to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), cases of very high caffeine intake (e.g. > 5 g) may result in caffeine intoxication with symptoms including mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations or psychosis, and rhabdomyolysis. === Energy drinks === High caffeine consumption in energy drinks (at least one liter or 320 mg of caffeine) was associated with short-term cardiovascular side effects including hypertension, prolonged QT interval, and heart palpitations. These cardiovascular side effects were not seen with smaller amounts of caffeine consumption in energy drinks (less than 200 mg). === Severe intoxication === As of 2007 there is no known antidote or reversal agent for caffeine intoxication. Treatment of mild caffeine intoxication is directed toward symptom relief; severe intoxication may require peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or hemofiltration. Intralipid infusion therapy is indicated in cases of imminent risk of cardiac arrest in order to scavenge the free serum caffeine. === Lethal dose === Death from caffeine ingestion appears to be rare, and most commonly caused by an intentional overdose of medications. In 2016, 3702 caffeine-related exposures were reported to Poison Control Centers in the United States, of which 846 required treatment at a medical facility, and 16 had a major outcome; and several caffeine-related deaths are reported in case studies. The LD50 of caffeine in rats is 192 milligrams per kilogram of body mass. The fatal dose in humans is estimated to be 150–200 milligrams per kilogram, which is 10.5–14 grams for a typical 70 kg (150 lb) adult, equivalent to about 75–100 cups of coffee. There are cases where doses as low as 57 milligrams per kilogram have been fatal. A number of fatalities have been caused by overdoses of readily available powdered caffeine supplements, for which the estimated lethal amount is less than a tablespoon. The lethal dose is lower in individuals whose ability to metabolize caffeine is impaired due to genetics or chronic liver disease. A death was reported in 2013 of a man with liver cirrhosis who overdosed on caffeinated mints. == Interactions == Caffeine is a substrate for CYP1A2, and interacts with many substances through this and other mechanisms. === Alcohol === According to DSST, alcohol causes a decrease in performance on their standardized tests, and caffeine causes a significant improvement. When alcohol and caffeine are consumed jointly, the effects of the caffeine are changed, but the alcohol effects remain the same. For example, consuming additional caffeine does not reduce the effect of alcohol. However, the jitteriness and alertness given by caffeine is decreased when additional alcohol is consumed. Alcohol consumption alone reduces both inhibitory and activational aspects of behavioral control. Caffeine antagonizes the effect of alcohol on the activational aspect of behavioral control, but has no effect on the inhibitory behavioral control. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend avoidance of concomitant consumption of alcohol and caffeine, as taking them together may lead to increased alcohol consumption, with a higher risk of alcohol-associated injury. === Smoking === Smoking tobacco has been shown to increase caffeine clearance by 56% as a result of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons inducing the CYP1A2 enzyme. The CYP1A2 enzyme that is induced by smoking is responsible for the metabolism of caffeine; increased enzyme activity leads to increased caffeine clearance, and is associated with greater coffee consumption for regular smokers. === Birth control === Birth control pills can extend the half-life of caffeine by as much as 40%, requiring greater attention to caffeine consumption. === Medications === Caffeine sometimes increases the effectiveness of some medications, such as those for headaches. Caffeine was determined to increase the potency of some over-the-counter analgesic medications by 40%. The pharmacological effects of adenosine may be blunted in individuals taking large quantities of methylxanthines like caffeine. Some other examples of methylxanthines include the medications theophylline and aminophylline, which are prescribed to relieve symptoms of asthma or COPD. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === In the absence of caffeine and when a person is awake and alert, little adenosine is present in CNS neurons. With a continued wakeful state, over time adenosine accumulates in the neuronal synapse, in turn binding to and activating adenosine receptors found on certain CNS neurons; when activated, these receptors produce a cellular response that ultimately increases drowsiness. When caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness. ==== Receptor and ion channel targets ==== Caffeine is an antagonist of adenosine A2A receptors, and knockout mouse studies have specifically implicated antagonism of the A2A receptor as responsible for the wakefulness-promoting effects of caffeine. Antagonism of A2A receptors in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) reduces inhibitory GABA neurotransmission to the tuberomammillary nucleus, a histaminergic projection nucleus that activation-dependently promotes arousal. This disinhibition of the tuberomammillary nucleus is the downstream mechanism by which caffeine produces wakefulness-promoting effects. Caffeine is an antagonist of all four adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), although with varying potencies. The affinity (KD) values of caffeine for the human adenosine receptors are 12 μM at A1, 2.4 μM at A2A, 13 μM at A2B, and 80 μM at A3. Antagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine also stimulates the medullary vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, which increases respiratory rate, reduces heart rate, and constricts blood vessels. Adenosine receptor antagonism also promotes neurotransmitter release (e.g., monoamines and acetylcholine), which endows caffeine with its stimulant effects; adenosine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. Heart palpitations are caused by blockade of the A1 receptor. Because caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily crosses the blood–brain barrier that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors (in other words, an agent that reduces the effects of adenosine). The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a competitive antagonist. In addition to its activity at adenosine receptors, caffeine is an inositol trisphosphate receptor 1 antagonist and a voltage-independent activator of the ryanodine receptors (RYR1, RYR2, and RYR3). It is also a competitive antagonist of the ionotropic glycine receptor. ==== Effects on striatal dopamine ==== While caffeine does not directly bind to any dopamine receptors, it influences the binding activity of dopamine at its receptors in the striatum by binding to adenosine receptors that have formed GPCR heteromers with dopamine receptors, specifically the A1–D1 receptor heterodimer (this is a receptor complex with one adenosine A1 receptor and one dopamine D1 receptor) and the A2A–D2 receptor heterotetramer (this is a receptor complex with two adenosine A2A receptors and two dopamine D2 receptors). The A2A–D2 receptor heterotetramer has been identified as a primary pharmacological target of caffeine, primarily because it mediates some of its psychostimulant effects and its pharmacodynamic interactions with dopaminergic psychostimulants. Caffeine also causes the release of dopamine in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens core (a substructure within the ventral striatum), but not the nucleus accumbens shell, by antagonizing A1 receptors in the axon terminal of dopamine neurons and A1–A2A heterodimers (a receptor complex composed of one adenosine A1 receptor and one adenosine A2A receptor) in the axon terminal of glutamate neurons. During chronic caffeine use, caffeine-induced dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens core is markedly reduced due to drug tolerance. ==== Enzyme targets ==== Caffeine, like other xanthines, also acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. As a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caffeine raises intracellular cyclic AMP, activates protein kinase A, inhibits TNF-alpha and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. Caffeine also affects the cholinergic system where it is a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. === Pharmacokinetics === Caffeine from coffee or other beverages is absorbed by the small intestine within 45 minutes of ingestion and distributed throughout all bodily tissues. Peak blood concentration is reached within 1–2 hours. It is eliminated by first-order kinetics. Caffeine can also be absorbed rectally, evidenced by suppositories of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine (for the relief of migraine) and of chlorobutanol and caffeine (for the treatment of hyperemesis). However, rectal absorption is less efficient than oral: the maximum concentration (Cmax) and total amount absorbed (AUC) are both about 30% (i.e., 1/3.5) of the oral amounts. Caffeine's biological half-life – the time required for the body to eliminate one-half of a dose – varies widely among individuals according to factors such as pregnancy, other drugs, liver enzyme function level (needed for caffeine metabolism) and age. In healthy adults, caffeine's half-life is between 3 and 7 hours. The half-life is decreased by 30-50% in adult male smokers, approximately doubled in women taking oral contraceptives, and prolonged in the last trimester of pregnancy. In newborns the half-life can be 80 hours or more, dropping rapidly with age, possibly to less than the adult value by age 6 months. The antidepressant fluvoxamine (Luvox) reduces the clearance of caffeine by more than 90%, and increases its elimination half-life more than tenfold, from 4.9 hours to 56 hours. Caffeine is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzyme system (particularly by the CYP1A2 isozyme) into three dimethylxanthines, each of which has its own effects on the body: Paraxanthine (84%): Increases lipolysis, leading to elevated glycerol and free fatty acid levels in blood plasma. Theobromine (12%): Dilates blood vessels and increases urine volume. Theobromine is also the principal alkaloid in the cocoa bean (chocolate). Theophylline (4%): Relaxes smooth muscles of the bronchi, and is used to treat asthma. The therapeutic dose of theophylline, however, is many times greater than the levels attained from caffeine metabolism. 1,3,7-Trimethyluric acid is a minor caffeine metabolite. 7-Methylxanthine is also a metabolite of caffeine. Each of the above metabolites is further metabolized and then excreted in the urine. Caffeine can accumulate in individuals with severe liver disease, increasing its half-life. A 2011 review found that increased caffeine intake was associated with a variation in two genes that increase the rate of caffeine catabolism. Subjects who had this mutation on both chromosomes consumed 40 mg more caffeine per day than others. This is presumably due to the need for a higher intake to achieve a comparable desired effect, not that the gene led to a disposition for greater incentive of habituation. == Chemistry == Pure anhydrous caffeine is a bitter-tasting, white, odorless powder with a melting point of 235–238 °C. Caffeine is moderately soluble in water at room temperature (2 g/100 mL), but quickly soluble in boiling water (66 g/100 mL). It is also moderately soluble in ethanol (1.5 g/100 mL). It is weakly basic (pKa of conjugate acid = ~0.6) requiring strong acid to protonate it. Caffeine does not contain any stereogenic centers and hence is classified as an achiral molecule. The xanthine core of caffeine contains two fused rings, a pyrimidinedione and imidazole. The pyrimidinedione in turn contains two amide functional groups that exist predominantly in a zwitterionic resonance the location from which the nitrogen atoms are double bonded to their adjacent amide carbons atoms. Hence all six of the atoms within the pyrimidinedione ring system are sp2 hybridized and planar. The imidazole ring also has a resonance. Therefore, the fused 5,6 ring core of caffeine contains a total of ten pi electrons and hence according to Hückel's rule is aromatic. === Synthesis === The biosynthesis of caffeine is an example of convergent evolution among different species. Caffeine may be synthesized in the lab starting with 1,3-dimethylurea and malonic acid. Production of synthesized caffeine largely takes place in pharmaceutical plants in China. Synthetic and natural caffeine are chemically identical and nearly indistinguishable. The primary distinction is that synthetic caffeine is manufactured from urea and chloroacetic acid, while natural caffeine is extracted from plant sources, a process known as decaffeination. Despite the different production methods, the final product and its effects on the body are similar. Research on synthetic caffeine supports that it has the same stimulating effects on the body as natural caffeine. And although many claim that natural caffeine is absorbed slower and therefore leads to a gentler caffeine crash, there is little scientific evidence supporting the notion. === Decaffeination === Germany, the birthplace of decaffeinated coffee, is home to several decaffeination plants, including the world's largest, Coffein Compagnie. Over half of the decaf coffee sold in the U.S. first travels from the tropics to Germany for caffeine removal before making its way to American consumers. Extraction of caffeine from coffee, to produce caffeine and decaffeinated coffee, can be performed using a number of solvents. Following are main methods: Water extraction: Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains many other compounds in addition to caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through activated charcoal, which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter caffeine tablets. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction: Supercritical carbon dioxide is an excellent nonpolar solvent for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: CO2 is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1 °C and pressures above 73 atm. Under these conditions, CO2 is in a ""supercritical"" state: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden CO2 is then sprayed with high-pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by charcoal adsorption (as above) or by distillation, recrystallization, or reverse osmosis. Extraction by organic solvents: Certain organic solvents such as ethyl acetate present much less health and environmental hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used formerly. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds. ""Decaffeinated"" coffees do in fact contain caffeine in many cases – some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable levels. One study found that decaffeinated coffee contained 10 mg of caffeine per cup, compared to approximately 85 mg of caffeine per cup for regular coffee. === Detection in body fluids === Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2–10 mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36 mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15 mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse. === Analogs === Some analog substances have been created which mimic caffeine's properties with either function or structure or both. Of the latter group are the xanthines DMPX and 8-chlorotheophylline, which is an ingredient in dramamine. Members of a class of nitrogen substituted xanthines are often proposed as potential alternatives to caffeine. Many other xanthine analogues constituting the adenosine receptor antagonist class have also been elucidated. Some other caffeine analogs: Dipropylcyclopentylxanthine 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine 8-Phenyltheophylline === Precipitation of tannins === Caffeine, as do other alkaloids such as cinchonine, quinine or strychnine, precipitates polyphenols and tannins. This property can be used in a quantitation method. == Natural occurrence == Around thirty plant species are known to contain caffeine. Common sources are the ""beans"" (seeds) of the two cultivated coffee plants, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora (the quantity varies, but 1.3% is a typical value); and of the cocoa plant, Theobroma cacao; the leaves of the tea plant; and kola nuts. Other sources include the leaves of yaupon holly, South American holly yerba mate, and Amazonian holly guayusa; and seeds from Amazonian maple guarana berries. Temperate climates around the world have produced unrelated caffeine-containing plants. Caffeine in plants acts as a natural pesticide: it can paralyze and kill predator insects feeding on the plant. High caffeine levels are found in coffee seedlings when they are developing foliage and lack mechanical protection. In addition, high caffeine levels are found in the surrounding soil of coffee seedlings, which inhibits seed germination of nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving seedlings with the highest caffeine levels fewer competitors for existing resources for survival. Caffeine is stored in tea leaves in two places. Firstly, in the cell vacuoles where it is complexed with polyphenols. This caffeine probably is released into the mouth parts of insects, to discourage herbivory. Secondly, around the vascular bundles, where it probably inhibits pathogenic fungi from entering and colonizing the vascular bundles. Caffeine in nectar may improve the reproductive success of the pollen producing plants by enhancing the reward memory of pollinators such as honey bees. The differing perceptions in the effects of ingesting beverages made from various plants containing caffeine could be explained by the fact that these beverages also contain varying mixtures of other methylxanthine alkaloids, including the cardiac stimulants theophylline and theobromine, and polyphenols that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine. == Products == Products containing caffeine include coffee, tea, soft drinks (""colas""), energy drinks, other beverages, chocolate, caffeine tablets, other oral products, and inhalation products. According to a 2020 study in the United States, coffee is the major source of caffeine intake in middle-aged adults, while soft drinks and tea are the major sources in adolescents. Energy drinks are more commonly consumed as a source of caffeine in adolescents as compared to adults. === Beverages === ==== Coffee ==== The world's primary source of caffeine is the coffee ""bean"" (the seed of the coffee plant), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of coffee bean and the method of preparation used; even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety espresso, to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of drip coffee. Arabica coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the robusta variety. In general, dark-roast coffee has slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces caffeine content of the bean by a small amount. ==== Tea ==== Tea contains more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since less of the product is used as compared to an equivalent serving of coffee. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, teas contain varying amounts of caffeine. Tea contains small amounts of theobromine and slightly higher levels of theophylline than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese green tea, gyokuro, for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like lapsang souchong, which has minimal content. ==== Soft drinks and energy drinks ==== Caffeine is also a common ingredient of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce (350 mL) serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient. ==== Other beverages ==== Maté is a drink popular in many parts of South America. Its preparation consists of filling a gourd with the leaves of the South American holly yerba mate, pouring hot but not boiling water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves. Guaraná is a soft drink originating in Brazil made from the seeds of the Guaraná fruit. The leaves of Ilex guayusa, the Ecuadorian holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a guayusa tea. The leaves of Ilex vomitoria, the yaupon holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a yaupon tea. Commercially prepared coffee-flavoured milk beverages are popular in Australia. Examples include Oak's Ice Coffee and Farmers Union Iced Coffee. The amount of caffeine in these beverages can vary widely. Caffeine concentrations can differ significantly from the manufacturer's claims. === Cacao solids === Cocoa solids (derived from cocoa bean) contain 230 mg caffeine per 100 g. The caffeine content varies between cocoa bean strains. Caffeine content mg/g (sorted by lowest caffeine content): Forastero (defatted): 1.3 mg/g Nacional (defatted): 2.4 mg/g Trinitario (defatted): 6.3/g Criollo (defatted): 11.3 mg/g ==== Chocolate ==== Caffeine per 100 g: Dark chocolate, 70-85% cacao solids: 80 mg Dark chocolate, 60-69% cacao solids: 86 mg Dark chocolate, 45- 59% cacao solids: 43 mg Milk chocolate: 20 mg The stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine. === Tablets === Tablets offer several advantages over coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages, including convenience, known dosage, and avoidance of concomitant intake of sugar, acids, and fluids. A use of caffeine in this form is said to improve mental alertness. These tablets are commonly used by students studying for their exams and by people who work or drive for long hours. === Other oral products === One U.S. company is marketing oral dissolvable caffeine strips. Another intake route is SpazzStick, a caffeinated lip balm. Alert Energy Caffeine Gum was introduced in the United States in 2013, but was voluntarily withdrawn after an announcement of an investigation by the FDA of the health effects of added caffeine in foods. === Inhalants === Similar to an e-cigarette, a caffeine inhaler may be used to deliver caffeine or a stimulant like guarana by vaping. In 2012, the FDA sent a warning letter to one of the companies marketing an inhaler, expressing concerns for the lack of safety information available about inhaled caffeine. === Combinations with other drugs === Some beverages combine alcohol with caffeine to create a caffeinated alcoholic drink. The stimulant effects of caffeine may mask the depressant effects of alcohol, potentially reducing the user's awareness of their level of intoxication. Such beverages have been the subject of bans due to safety concerns. In particular, the United States Food and Drug Administration has classified caffeine added to malt liquor beverages as an ""unsafe food additive"". Ya ba contains a combination of methamphetamine and caffeine. Painkillers such as propyphenazone/paracetamol/caffeine combine caffeine with an analgesic. == History == === Discovery and spread of use === According to Chinese legend, the Chinese emperor Shennong, reputed to have reigned in about 3000 BCE, inadvertently discovered tea when he noted that when certain leaves fell into boiling water, a fragrant and restorative drink resulted. Shennong is also mentioned in Lu Yu's Cha Jing, a famous early work on the subject of tea. The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee plant appears in the middle of the fifteenth century, in the Sufi monasteries of the Yemen in southern Arabia. From Mocha, coffee spread to Egypt and North Africa, and by the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia and Turkey. From the Middle East, coffee drinking spread to Italy, then to the rest of Europe, and coffee plants were transported by the Dutch to the East Indies and to the Americas. Kola nut use appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many West African cultures, in both private and social settings, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs. The earliest evidence of cocoa bean use comes from residue found in an ancient Mayan pot dated to 600 BCE. Also, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called xocolatl, often seasoned with vanilla, chile pepper, and achiote. Xocolatl was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the theobromine and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, and cocoa beans were often used as currency. Xocolatl was introduced to Europe by the Spaniards, and became a popular beverage by 1700. The Spaniards also introduced the cacao tree into the West Indies and the Philippines. The leaves and stems of the yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) were used by Native Americans to brew a tea called asi or the ""black drink"". Archaeologists have found evidence of this use far into antiquity, possibly dating to Late Archaic times. === Chemical identification, isolation, and synthesis === In 1819, the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time; he called it ""Kaffebase"" (i.e., a base that exists in coffee). According to Runge, he did this at the behest of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In 1821, caffeine was isolated both by the French chemist Pierre Jean Robiquet and by another pair of French chemists, Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou, according to Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in his yearly journal. Furthermore, Berzelius stated that the French chemists had made their discoveries independently of any knowledge of Runge's or each other's work. However, Berzelius later acknowledged Runge's priority in the extraction of caffeine, stating: ""However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his Phytochemical Discoveries, 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name Caffeebase a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris."" Pelletier's article on caffeine was the first to use the term in print (in the French form Caféine from the French word for coffee: café). It corroborates Berzelius's account: Caffeine, noun (feminine). Crystallizable substance discovered in coffee in 1821 by Mr. Robiquet. During the same period – while they were searching for quinine in coffee because coffee is considered by several doctors to be a medicine that reduces fevers and because coffee belongs to the same family as the cinchona [quinine] tree – on their part, Messrs. Pelletier and Caventou obtained caffeine; but because their research had a different goal and because their research had not been finished, they left priority on this subject to Mr. Robiquet. We do not know why Mr. Robiquet has not published the analysis of coffee which he read to the Pharmacy Society. Its publication would have allowed us to make caffeine better known and give us accurate ideas of coffee's composition ... Robiquet was one of the first to isolate and describe the properties of pure caffeine, whereas Pelletier was the first to perform an elemental analysis. In 1827, M. Oudry isolated ""théine"" from tea, but in 1838 it was proved by Mulder and by Carl Jobst that theine was actually the same as caffeine. In 1895, German chemist Hermann Emil Fischer (1852–1919) first synthesized caffeine from its chemical components (i.e. a ""total synthesis""), and two years later, he also derived the structural formula of the compound. This was part of the work for which Fischer was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902. === Historic regulations === Because it was recognized that coffee contained some compound that acted as a stimulant, first coffee and later also caffeine has sometimes been subject to regulation. For example, in the 16th century Islamists in Mecca and in the Ottoman Empire made coffee illegal for some classes. Charles II of England tried to ban it in 1676, Frederick II of Prussia banned it in 1777, and coffee was banned in Sweden at various times between 1756 and 1823. In 1911, caffeine became the focus of one of the earliest documented health scares, when the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of Coca-Cola syrup in Chattanooga, Tennessee, alleging the caffeine in its drink was ""injurious to health"". Although the Supreme Court later ruled in favor of Coca-Cola in United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola, two bills were introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1912 to amend the Pure Food and Drug Act, adding caffeine to the list of ""habit-forming"" and ""deleterious"" substances, which must be listed on a product's label. == Society and culture == === Regulations === ==== United States ==== The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers safe beverages containing less than 0.02% caffeine; but caffeine powder, which is sold as a dietary supplement, is unregulated. It is a regulatory requirement that the label of most prepackaged foods must declare a list of ingredients, including food additives such as caffeine, in descending order of proportion. However, there is no regulatory provision for mandatory quantitative labeling of caffeine, (e.g., milligrams caffeine per stated serving size). There are a number of food ingredients that naturally contain caffeine. These ingredients must appear in food ingredient lists. However, as is the case for ""food additive caffeine"", there is no requirement to identify the quantitative amount of caffeine in composite foods containing ingredients that are natural sources of caffeine. While coffee or chocolate are broadly recognized as caffeine sources, some ingredients (e.g., guarana, yerba maté) are likely less recognized as caffeine sources. For these natural sources of caffeine, there is no regulatory provision requiring that a food label identify the presence of caffeine nor state the amount of caffeine present in the food. The FDA guidance was updated in 2018. === Consumption === Global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000 tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance. The consumption of caffeine has remained stable between 1997 and 2015. Coffee, tea and soft drinks are the most common caffeine sources, with energy drinks contributing little to the total caffeine intake across all age groups. === Religions === The Seventh-day Adventist Church asked for its members to ""abstain from caffeinated drinks"", but has removed this from baptismal vows (while still recommending abstention as policy). Some from these religions believe that one is not supposed to consume a non-medical, psychoactive substance, or believe that one is not supposed to consume a substance that is addictive. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has said the following with regard to caffeinated beverages: ""... the Church revelation spelling out health practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) does not mention the use of caffeine. The Church's health guidelines prohibit alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and 'hot drinks' – taught by Church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee."" Gaudiya Vaishnavas generally also abstain from caffeine, because they believe it clouds the mind and overstimulates the senses. To be initiated under a guru, one must have had no caffeine, alcohol, nicotine or other drugs, for at least a year. Caffeinated beverages are widely consumed by Muslims. In the 16th century, some Muslim authorities made unsuccessful attempts to ban them as forbidden ""intoxicating beverages"" under Islamic dietary laws. == Other organisms == The bacteria Pseudomonas putida CBB5 can live on pure caffeine and can cleave caffeine into carbon dioxide and ammonia. Caffeine is toxic to birds and to dogs and cats, and has a pronounced adverse effect on mollusks, various insects, and spiders. This is at least partly due to a poor ability to metabolize the compound, causing higher levels for a given dose per unit weight. Caffeine has also been found to enhance the reward memory of honey bees. == Research == Caffeine has been used to double chromosomes in haploid wheat. == See also == Adderall Amphetamine Cocaine Health effects of coffee Health effects of tea List of chemical compounds in coffee Low caffeine coffee Methylliberine Nootropic Theobromine Theophylline Wakefulness-promoting agent == References == Notes Citations == Bibliography == == External links == GMD MS Spectrum Caffeine: ChemSub Online Caffeine at The Periodic Table of Videos (University of Nottingham)"	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.013084466, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -1.9361265e-07, ' FOOD': -9.610702e-06}
9	Triphenylphosphine oxide	WIKIPEDIA	Triphenylphosphine oxide (often abbreviated TPPO) is the organophosphorus compound with the formula OP(C6H5)3, also written as Ph3PO or PPh3O (Ph = C6H5). It is one of the more common phosphine oxides. This colourless crystalline compound is a common but potentially useful waste product in reactions involving triphenylphosphine. It is a popular reagent to induce the crystallizing of chemical compounds. == Structure and properties == Ph3PO is structurally related to POCl3. As established by X-ray crystallography, the geometry around P is tetrahedral, and the P-O distance is 1.48 Å. Other modifications of Ph3PO have been found: For example, a monoclinic form crystalizes in the space group P21/c with Z = 4 and a = 15.066(1) Å, b = 9.037(2) Å, c = 11.296(3) Å, and β = 98.47(1)°.The orthorhombic modification crystallizes in the space group Pbca with Z = 4 and 29.089(3) Å, b = 9.1347(9), c = 11.261(1) Å. The oxygen center is relatively basic. The rigidity of the backbone and the basicity of the oxygen center make this species a popular agent to crystallize otherwise difficult to crystallize molecules. This trick is applicable to molecules that have acidic hydrogen atoms, e.g. phenols. == As a byproduct of organic synthesis == Ph3PO is a byproduct of many useful reactions in organic synthesis including the Wittig, Staudinger, and Mitsunobu reactions. It is also formed when PPh3Cl2 is employed to convert alcohols into alkyl chlorides: Ph3PCl2 + ROH → Ph3PO + HCl + RCl Triphenylphosphine can be regenerated from the oxide by treatment with a variety of deoxygenation agents, such as phosgene or trichlorosilane/triethylamine: Ph3PO + SiHCl3 → PPh3 + 1/n (OSiCl2)n + HCl Triphenylphosphine oxide can be difficult to remove from reaction mixtures by means of chromatography. It is poorly soluble in hexane and cold diethyl ether. Trituration or chromatography of crude products with these solvents often leads to a good separation of triphenylphosphine oxide. Its removal is facilitated by conversion to its Mg(II) complex, which is poorly soluble in toluene or dichloromethane and can be filtered off. An alternative filtration method where ZnCl2(TPPO)2 is formed upon addition of ZnCl2 may be used with more polar solvents such as ethanol, ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran. == Coordination chemistry == Ph3PO forms a variety of complexes. A representative complex is the tetrahedral species NiCl2(OPPh3)2. Ph3PO is a common impurity in PPh3. The oxidation of PPh3 by oxygen, including air, is catalysed by many metal ions: 2 PPh3 + O2 → 2 Ph3PO == References ==	INDUSTRIAL	INDUSTRIAL	{'IND': -1.1756368e-05, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0}
11	Dioctyl phthalate	WIKIPEDIA	"Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate, diisooctyl phthalate, DEHP; incorrectly — dioctyl phthalate, DIOP) is an organic compound with the formula C6H4(CO2C8H17)2. DEHP is the most common member of the class of phthalates, which are used as plasticizers. It is the diester of phthalic acid and the branched-chain 2-ethylhexanol. This colorless viscous liquid is soluble in oil, but not in water. == Production == Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate is produced commercially by the reaction of excess 2-ethylhexanol with phthalic anhydride in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid or para-toluenesulfonic acid. It was first produced in commercial quantities in Japan circa 1933 and in the United States in 1939. DEHP has two stereocenters, located at the carbon atoms carrying the ethyl groups. As a result, it has three distinct stereoisomers, consisting of an (R,R) form, an (S,S) form (diastereomers), and a meso (R, S) form. As most 2-ethylhexanol is produced as a racemic mixture, commercially-produced DEHP is therefore racemic as well, and consists of a 1:1:2 statistical mixture of stereoisomers. == Use == Due to its suitable properties and the low cost, DEHP is widely used as a plasticizer in manufacturing of articles made of PVC. Plastics may contain 1% to 40% of DEHP. It is also used as a hydraulic fluid and as a dielectric fluid in capacitors. DEHP also finds use as a solvent in glowsticks. Approximately three million tonnes are produced and used annually worldwide. Manufacturers of flexible PVC articles can choose among several alternative plasticizers offering similar technical properties as DEHP. These alternatives include other phthalates such as diisononyl phthalate (DINP), di-2-propyl heptyl phthalate (DPHP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and non-phthalates such as 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH), dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP), and citrate esters. == Environmental exposure == DEHP is a component of many household items, including tablecloths, floor tiles, shower curtains, garden hoses, rainwear, dolls, toys, shoes, medical tubing, furniture upholstery, and swimming pool liners. DEHP is an indoor air pollutant in homes and schools. Common exposures come from the use of DEHP as a fragrance carrier in cosmetics, personal care products, laundry detergents, colognes, scented candles, and air fresheners. The most common exposure to DEHP comes through food with an average consumption of 0.25 milligrams per day. It can also leach into a liquid that comes in contact with the plastic; it extracts faster into nonpolar solvents (e.g. oils and fats in foods packed in PVC). Fatty foods that are packaged in plastics that contain DEHP are more likely to have higher concentrations such as milk products, fish or seafood, and oils. The US FDA therefore permits use of DEHP-containing packaging only for foods that primarily contain water. DEHP can leach into drinking water from discharges from rubber and chemical factories; The US EPA limits for DEHP in drinking water is 6 ppb. It is also commonly found in bottled water, but unlike tap water, the EPA does not regulate levels in bottled water. DEHP levels in some European samples of milk, were found at 2000 times higher than the EPA Safe Drinking Water limits (12,000 ppb). Levels of DEHP in some European cheeses and creams were even higher, up to 200,000 ppb, in 1994. Additionally, workers in factories that utilize DEHP in production experience greater exposure. The U.S. agency OSHA's limit for occupational exposure is 5 mg/m3 of air. === Use in medical devices === DEHP is the most common phthalate plasticizer in medical devices such as intravenous tubing and bags, IV catheters, nasogastric tubes, dialysis bags and tubing, blood bags and transfusion tubing, and air tubes. DEHP makes these plastics softer and more flexible and was first introduced in the 1940s in blood bags. For this reason, concern has been expressed about leachates of DEHP transported into the patient, especially for those requiring extensive infusions or those who are at the highest risk of developmental abnormalities, e.g. newborns in intensive care nursery settings, hemophiliacs, kidney dialysis patients, neonates, premature babies, lactating, and pregnant women. According to the European Commission Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), exposure to DEHP may exceed the tolerable daily intake in some specific population groups, namely people exposed through medical procedures such as kidney dialysis. The American Academy of Pediatrics has advocated not to use medical devices that can leach DEHP into patients and, instead, to resort to DEHP-free alternatives. In July 2002, the U.S. FDA issued a Public Health Notification on DEHP, stating in part, ""We recommend considering such alternatives when these high-risk procedures are to be performed on male neonates, pregnant women who are carrying male fetuses, and peripubertal males"" noting that the alternatives were to look for non-DEHP exposure solutions; they mention a database of alternatives. The CBC documentary The Disappearing Male raised concerns about sexual development in male fetal development, miscarriage, and as a cause of dramatically lower sperm counts in men. A review article in 2010 in the Journal of Transfusion Medicine showed a consensus that the benefits of lifesaving treatments with these devices far outweigh the risks of DEHP leaching out of these devices. Although more research is needed to develop alternatives to DEHP that gives the same benefits of being soft and flexible, which are required for most medical procedures, if a procedure requires one of these devices and if patient is at high risk to suffer from DEHP then a DEHP alternative should be considered if medically safe. === Metabolism === DEHP hydrolyzes to mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and subsequently to phthalate salts. The released alcohol is susceptible to oxidation to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid. == Effects on living organisms == === Toxicity === The acute toxicity of DEHP is low in animal models: 30 g/kg in rats (oral) and 24 g/kg in rabbits (dermal). Concerns instead focus on its potential as an endocrine disruptor. === Endocrine disruption === DEHP, along with other phthalates, is believed to cause endocrine disruption in males, through its action as an androgen antagonist, and may have lasting effects on reproductive function, for both childhood and adult exposures. Prenatal phthalate exposure has been shown to be associated with lower levels of reproductive function in adolescent males. In another study, airborne concentrations of DEHP at a PVC pellet plant were significantly associated with a reduction in sperm motility and chromatin DNA integrity. Additionally, the authors noted the daily intake estimates for DEHP were comparable to the general population, indicating a ""high percentage of men are exposed to levels of DEHP that may affect sperm motility and chromatin DNA integrity"". The claims have received support by a study using dogs as a ""sentinel species to approximate human exposure to a selection of chemical mixtures present in the environment"". The authors analyzed the concentration of DEHP and other common chemicals such as PCBs in testes from dogs from five different world regions. The results showed that regional differences in concentration of the chemicals are reflected in dog testes and that pathologies such as tubule atrophy and germ cells were more prevalent in testes of dogs from regions with higher concentrations. === Development === Numerous studies of DEHP have shown changes in sexual function and development in mice and rats. DEHP exposure during pregnancy has been shown to disrupt placental growth and development in mice, resulting in higher rates of low birthweight, premature birth, and fetal loss. In a separate study, exposure of neonatal mice to DEHP through lactation caused hypertrophy of the adrenal glands and higher levels of anxiety during puberty. In another study, pubertal administration of higher-dose DEHP delayed puberty in rats, reduced testosterone production, and inhibited androgen-dependent development; low doses showed no effect. === Obesity === When DEHP is ingested intestinal lipases convert it to MEHP, which then is absorbed. MEHP is suspected to have an obesogenic effect. Rodent studies and human studies have shown DEHP to be a possible disruptor of thyroid function, which plays a key role in energy balance and metabolism. Exposure to DEHP has been associated with lower plasma thyroxine levels and decreased uptake of iodine in thyroid follicular cells. Previous studies have shown that slight changes in thyroxine levels can have dramatic effects on resting energy expenditure, similar to that of patients with hypothyroidism, which has been shown to cause increased weight gain in those study populations. === Cardiotoxicity === Even at relatively low doses of DEHP, cardiovascular reactivity was significantly affected in mice. A clinically relevant dose and duration of exposure to DEHP has been shown to have a significant impact on the behavior of cardiac cells in culture. This includes an uncoupling effect that leads to irregular rhythms in vitro. Untreated cells had fast conduction velocity, along with homogenous activation wave fronts and synchronized beating. Cells treated with DEHP exhibited fractured wave fronts with slow propagation speeds. This is observed in conjunction with a significant decrease in the amount of expression and instability of gap junctional connexin proteins, specifically connexin-43, in cardiomyocytes treated with DEHP. The decrease in expression and instability of connexin-43 may be due to the down regulation of tubulin and kinesin genes, and the alteration of microtubule structure, caused by DEHP; all of which are responsible for the transport of protein products. Also, DEHP caused down regulation of several growth factors, such as angiotensinogen, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor C and A, and endothelial-1. The DEHP-induced down regulation of these growth factors may also contribute to the reduced expression and instability of connexin-43. DEHP has also been shown, in vitro using cardiac muscle cells, to cause activation of PPAR-alpha gene, which is a key regulator in lipid metabolism and peroxisome proliferation; both of which can be involved in atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia, which are precursors of cardiovascular disease. Once metabolized into MEHP, the molecule has been shown to lengthen action potential duration and slow epicardial conduction velocity in Langendorff perfused rodent hearts. === Other health effects === Studies in mice have shown other adverse health effects due to DEHP exposure. Ingestion of 0.01% DEHP caused damage to the blood-testis barrier as well as induction of experimental autoimmune orchitis. There is also a correlation between DEHP plasma levels in women and endometriosis. DEHP is also a possible cancer causing agent in humans, although human studies remain inconclusive, due to the exposure of multiple elements and limited research. In vitro and rodent studies indicate that DEHP is involved in many molecular events, including increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, oxidative damage, and selective clonal expansion of the initiated cells; all of which take place in multiple sites of the human body. == Government and industry response == === Taiwan === In October 2009, Consumers' Foundation, Taiwan (CFCT) published test results that found 5 out of the sampled 12 shoes contained over 0.1% of phthalate plasticizer content, including DEHP, which exceeds the government's Toy Safety Standard (CNS 4797). CFCT recommend that users should first wear socks to avoid direct skin contact. In May 2011, the illegal use of the plasticizer DEHP in clouding agents for use in food and beverages has been reported in Taiwan. An inspection of products initially discovered the presence of plasticizers. As more products were tested, inspectors found more manufacturers using DEHP and DINP. The Department of Health confirmed that contaminated food and beverages had been exported to other countries and regions, which reveals the widespread prevalence of toxic plasticizers. === European Union === Concerns about chemicals ingested by children when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission to order a temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of which is based on an opinion by the Commission's Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other phthalates (DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of phthalates (DINP, DIDP, and DNOP) ""in toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth by children"". Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including musk xylene, MDA, HBCDD, DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in Annex XIV of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011. According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015. In 2012, Danish Environment Minister Ida Auken announced the ban of DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP, pushing Denmark ahead of the European Union which has already started a process of phasing out phthalates. However, it was postponed by two years and would take effect in 2015 and not in December 2013, which was the initial plan. The reason is that the four phthalates are far more common than expected and that producers cannot phase out phthalates as fast as the Ministry of Environment requested. In 2012, France became the first country in the EU to ban the use of DEHP in pediatrics, neonatal, and maternity wards in hospitals. DEHP has now been classified as a Category 1B reprotoxin, and is now on the Annex XIV of the European Union's REACH legislation. DEHP has been phased out in Europe under REACH and can only be used in specific cases if an authorization has been granted. Authorizations are granted by the European Commission, after obtaining the opinion of the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). === California === DEHP is classified as a ""chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm"" (in this case, both) under the terms of Proposition 65. == References == == Further reading == Maradonna, Francesca; Evangelisti, Matteo; Gioacchini, Giorgia; et al.

13	Ofloxacin	WIKIPEDIA	"Ofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. When taken by mouth or injection into a vein, these include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, plague, and certain types of infectious diarrhea. Other uses, along with other medications, include treating multidrug resistant tuberculosis. An eye drop may be used for a superficial bacterial infection of the eye and an ear drop may be used for otitis media when a hole in the ear drum is present. When taken by mouth, common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash. Other serious side effect include tendon rupture, numbness due to nerve damage, seizures, and psychosis. Use in pregnancy is typically not recommended. Ofloxacin is in the fluoroquinolone family of medications. It works by interfering with the bacterium's DNA. Ofloxacin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1985. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ofloxacin is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 206th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ofloxacin is used in the treatment of bacterial infections such as: Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Community-acquired pneumonia Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections Nongonococcal urethritis and cervicitis Epididymitis Mixed Infections of the urethra and cervix Acute pelvic inflammatory disease Uncomplicated cystitis Complicated urinary tract infections Prostatitis Acute, uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea Ofloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis. Fluoroquinolones, the class of drug ofloxacin belongs to, were the drug of choice for treating gonorrhea in the 1980s; However, due to the development of fluoroquinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, fluoroquinolones were no longer used to treat gonorrhea by the late 1990s. As of 2004, the failure of single dose ofloxacin to treat gonorrhea has been reported in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. === Susceptible bacteria === According to the product package insert, ofloxacin is effective against these microorganisms: Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter koseri (Citrobacter diversus) Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria gonorrhoeae Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Other microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis == Adverse effects == In general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side effects being mild to moderate. On occasion, serious adverse effects occur. Common side effects include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as headache and insomnia. The overall rate of adverse events in patients treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in patients treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control study found patients treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, or vancomycin. Postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of ""black box"" warnings in the United States. The most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the Achilles tendon. Younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients. The overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated Achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments. Risk is substantially elevated in the elderly and in those with recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Simultaneous use of corticosteroids is present in almost one-third of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. Tendon damage may manifest during and up to a year after fluoroquinolone therapy has been completed. Fluoroquinolones prolong the QT interval by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. Prolongation of the QT interval can lead to torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice, this appears relatively uncommon in part because the most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) only minimally prolong the QT interval. Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea may occur in connection with the use of any antibacterial drug, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity such as clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinoline treatment is associated with risk similar to or less than that associated with broad spectrum cephalosporins. Fluoroquinolone administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridium strain. The US prescribing information contains a warning regarding uncommon cases of peripheral neuropathy, which can be permanent. Other nervous system effects include insomnia, restlessness, and rarely, seizure, convulsions, and psychosis Other rare and serious adverse events have been observed with varying degrees of evidence for causation. Events that may occur in acute overdose are rare, and include kidney failure and seizure. Susceptible groups of patients, such as children and the elderly, are at greater risk of adverse reactions during therapeutic use. Ofloxacin, like some other fluoroquinolones, may inhibit drug-metabolizing enzymes, and thereby increase blood levels of other drugs such as cyclosporine, theophylline, and warfarin, among others. These increased blood levels may result in a greater risk of side effects. Careful monitoring of serum glucose is advised when ofloxacin or other fluorquinolones are used by people who are taking sulfonylurea antidiabetes drugs. The concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a quinolone, including ofloxacin, may increase the risk of central nervous system stimulation and convulsive seizures. The fluoroquinolones have been shown to increase the anticoagulant effect of acenocoumarol, anisindione, and dicumarol. Additionally, the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias is increased when co-administered with drugs such as dihydroquinidine barbiturate, quinidine, and quinidine barbiturate. Current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones. == Contraindications == As noted above, under licensed use, ofloxacin is now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance. Caution should be used in people with liver disease. The excretion of ofloxacin may be reduced in patients with severe liver function disorders (e.g., cirrhosis with or without ascites). Ofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients with psychiatric illnesses and in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders. === Pregnancy === Ofloxacin has not been shown to have any teratogenic effects at oral doses as high as 810 mg/kg/day (11 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 50 times based on mg/kg) and 160 mg/kg/day (four times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 10 times based on mg/kg) when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively. Additional studies in rats with oral doses up to 360 mg/kg/day (five times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 23 times based on mg/kg) demonstrated no adverse effect on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. Doses equivalent to 50 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose of ofloxacin (based on mg/kg) were fetotoxic (i.e., decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality) in rats and rabbits, respectively. Minor skeletal variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810 mg/kg/day, which is more than 10 times higher than the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ofloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. === Children === Oral and intravenous ofloxacin are not licensed for use in children, except as noted above, due to the risk of musculoskeletal injury. In one study, 1534 juvenile patients (age 6 months to 16 years) treated with levofloxacin as part of three efficacy trials were followed up to assess all musculoskeletal events occurring up to 12 months after treatment. At 12 months' follow-up, the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics. In the levafloxacin-treated group, about two-thirds of these musculoskeletal adverse events occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae. In a study comparing the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with levofloxacin and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these adverse events were thought to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the levofloxacin. Two deaths were observed in the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System at the time of the 20 September 2011 FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee include musculoskeletal events (39, including five cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including five cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. An estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for levofloxacin were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period. == Overdose == Limited information is available on overdose with ofloxacin. Advice for the management of an acute overdose of ofloxacin is emptying of the stomach, along with close observation, and making sure that the patient is appropriately hydrated. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is of only limited effectiveness. Overdose may result in central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon/articular toxicity, and hepatic toxicity as well as kidney failure and seizure. Both seizures and severe psychiatric reactions have, however, been reported to occur at therapeutic dosage. == Pharmacokinetics == The bioavailability of ofloxacin in the tablet form is roughly 98% following oral administration, reaching maximum serum concentrations within one to two hours. Between 65% and 80% of an administered oral dose of ofloxacin is excreted unchanged via the kidneys within 48 hours of dosing. Therefore, elimination is mainly by renal excretion. However, 4-8% of an ofloxacin dose is excreted in the feces. This would indicate a small degree of biliary excretion, as well. Plasma elimination half-life is around 4 to 5 hours in patients and 6.4 to 7.4 hours in elderly patients. Ofloxacin is a racemic mixture, which consists of 50% levofloxacin (the biologically active component) and 50% of its “mirror image” or enantiomer dextrofloxacin. ""After multiple-dose administration of 200 mg and 300 mg doses, peak serum levels of 2.2 and 3.6 μg/ml, respectively, are predicted at steady-state. In vitro, approximately 32% of the drug in plasma is protein bound. Floxin is widely distributed to body tissues. Ofloxacin has been detected in blister fluid, cervix, lung tissue, ovary, prostatic fluid, prostatic tissue, skin, and sputum. Pyridobenzoxazine ring appears to decrease the extent of parent compound metabolism. Less than 5% is eliminated by the kidneys as desmethyl or N-oxide metabolites; 4% to 8% by feces."" A number of the endogenous compounds have been reported to be affected by ofloxacin as inhibitors, alteraters, and depletors. See the latest package insert for ofloxacin for additional details. == Mode of action == Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting two bacterial type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme necessary to separate (mostly in prokaryotes, in bacteria in particular) replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting bacterial cell division. == History == Ofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone, being a broader-spectrum analog of norfloxacin, and was synthesized and developed by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku. It was first approved for marketing in Japan in 1985, for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under the brand name Tarvid. Daiichi, working with Johnson & Johnson, obtained FDA approval in December 1990, under the brand name Floxin, labelled for use in adults with lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, and sexually transmitted diseases. By 1991, it was also marketed as Tarvid by Hoechst in the UK, Germany, Belgium, and Portugal; as Oflocet in France, Portugal, Tunisia, and several African countries by Roussel-Uclaf, as Oflocin by Glaxo in Italy, and as Flobacin by Sigma-Tau in Italy. The market for ofloxacin was seen as difficult from its launch; it was approved as a ""1C"" drug, a new molecular entity with little or no therapeutic gain over existing therapies, and ciprofloxacin, which had a broader spectrum, was already on the market. By 1992, an intravenous solution was approved for marketing, In 1997, an indication for pelvic inflammatory disease was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the oral formulation, and in the same year, a solution for ear infections was approved under the brand Daiichi and J&J also cannibalized its own market by introducing levofloxacin, the levo-enantiomer of ofloxacin, in 1996; Johnson and Johnson's annual sales of Floxin in 2003 was about $30 million, whereas their combined sales of Levaquin/Floxin exceeded $1.15 billion in the same year. Johnson & Johnson withdrew the marketing application in 2009. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Ofloxacin for systemic use is available in multiple strengths as a tablet, an oral suspension, and an injectable solution. It is also used as eye drops and ear drops and is available in combination with ornidazole. === Antibiotic use and bacterial resistance === Resistance to ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during a course of treatment. Numerous pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes now exhibit resistance worldwide. Floxacin and other fluoroquinolones had become the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics to adults in 2002. Nearly half (42%) of these prescriptions were for conditions not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as acute bronchitis, otitis media, and acute upper respiratory tract infection. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.0280384e-06, 'ICAL': 0.0}
14	Acacetin	WIKIPEDIA	Acacetin is a 4′-O-methylated flavone of the parent compound apigenin, found in Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust), Turnera diffusa (damiana), Betula pendula (silver birch), and in the fern Asplenium normale. In plant synthesis the enzyme apigenin 4′-O-methyltransferase uses S-adenosyl methionine and 5,7,4′-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) to produce S-adenosylhomocysteine and 4′-methoxy-5,7-dihydroxyflavone (acacetin). It shows moderate aromatase inhibition. == See also == Genkwanin (methoxylated apigenin) Thevetiaflavone (methoxylated apigenin) == References ==	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -5.6219335e-05, 'OD': 0.0}
15	Noscapine	WIKIPEDIA	"Noscapine, also known as narcotine, nectodon, nospen, anarcotine and (archaic) opiane, is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid of the phthalideisoquinoline structural subgroup, which has been isolated from numerous species of the family Papaveraceae (poppy family). It lacks effects associated with opioids such as sedation, euphoria, or analgesia (pain-relief) and lacks addictive potential. Noscapine is primarily used for its antitussive (cough-suppressing) effects. == Medical uses == Noscapine is often used as an antitussive medication. A 2012 Dutch guideline, however, does not recommend its use for acute coughing. == Side effects == Nausea Vomiting Loss of coordination Hallucinations (auditory and visual) Loss of sexual drive Swelling of prostate Loss of appetite Dilated pupils Increased heart rate Shaking and muscle spasms Chest pain Increased alertness Increased wakefulness Loss of stereoscopic vision == Interactions == Noscapine can increase the effects of centrally sedating substances such as alcohol and hypnotics. The drug should not be taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as unknown and potentially fatal effects may occur. Noscapine should not be taken in conjunction with warfarin as the anticoagulant effects of warfarin may be increased. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of noscapine in P. somniferum begins with chorismic acid, which is synthesized via the shikimate pathway from erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate. Chorismic acid is a precursor to the amino acid tyrosine, the source of nitrogen in benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Tyrosine can undergo a PLP-mediated transamination to form 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (4-HPP), followed by a TPP-mediated decarboxylation to form 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). Tyrosine can also be hydroxylated to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), followed by a PLP-mediated decarboxylation to form dopamine. Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) catalyzes a Pictet-Spengler reaction between 4-HPAA and dopamine to synthesize (S)-norcoclaurine, providing the characteristic benzylisoquinoline scaffold. (S)-Norcoclaurine is sequentially 6-O-methylated (6OMT), N-methylated (CNMT), 3-hydroxylated (NMCH), and 4′-O-methylated (4′OMT), with the use of cofactors S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) and NADP+ for methylations and hydroxylations, respectively. These reactions produce (S)-reticuline, a key branchpoint intermediate in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. The remainder of the noscapine biosynthetic pathway is largely governed by a single biosynthetic 10-gene cluster. Genes comprising the cluster encode enzymes responsible for nine of the eleven remaining chemical transformations. First, berberine bridge enzyme (BBE), an enzyme not encoded by the cluster, forms the fused four-ring structure in (S)-scoulerine. BBE uses O2 as an oxidant and is aided by cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Next, an O-methyltransferase (SOMT) methylates the 9-hydroxyl group. Canadine synthase (CAS) catalyzes the formation of a unique C2-C3 methylenedioxy bridge in (S)-canadine. An N-methylation (TNMT) and two hydroxylations (CYP82Y1, CYP82X2) follow, aided by SAM and O2/NADPH, respectively. The C13 alcohol is then acetylated by an acetyltransferase (AT1) using acetyl-CoA. Another cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP82X1) catalyzes the hydroxylation of C8, and the newly formed hemiaminal spontaneously cleaves, yielding a tertiary amine and aldehyde. A methyltransferase heterodimer (OMT2:OMT3) catalyzes a SAM-mediated O-methylation on C4′. The O-acetyl group is then cleaved by a carboxylesterase (CXE1), yielding an alcohol which immediately reacts with the neighboring C1 aldehyde to form a hemiacetal in a new five-membered ring. The apparent counteractivity between AT1 and CXE1 suggests that acetylation in this context is employed as a protective group, preventing hemiacetal formation until the ester is enzymatically cleaved. Finally, an NAD+-dependent short-chain dehydrogenase (NOS) oxidizes the hemiacetal to a lactone, completing noscapine biosynthesis. == Mechanism of action == Noscapine's antitussive effects appear to be primarily mediated by its σ–receptor agonist activity. Evidence for this mechanism is suggested by experimental evidence in rats. Pretreatment with rimcazole, a σ-specific antagonist, causes a dose-dependent reduction in antitussive activity of noscapine. Noscapine, and its synthetic derivatives called noscapinoids, are known to interact with microtubules and inhibit cancer cell proliferation == Structure analysis == The lactone ring is unstable and opens in basic media. The opposite reaction is presented in acidic media. The bond (C1−C3′) connecting the two optically active carbon atoms is also unstable. In aqueous solution of sulfuric acid and heating it dissociates into cotarnine (4-methoxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]isoquinoline) and opic acid (6-formyl-2,3-dimethoxybenzoic acid). When noscapine is reduced with zinc/HCl, the bond C1−C3′ saturates and the molecule dissociates into hydrocotarnine (2-hydroxycotarnine) and meconine (6,7-dimethoxyisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one). == History == Noscapine was first isolated and characterized in chemical breakdown and properties in 1803 under the denomination of ""Narcotine"" by Jean-Francois Derosne, a French chemist in Paris. Then Pierre-Jean Robiquet, another French chemist, proved narcotine and morphine to be distinct alkaloids in 1831. Finally, Pierre-Jean Robiquet conducted over 20 years between 1815 and 1835 a series of studies in the enhancement of methods for the isolation of morphine, and also isolated in 1832 another very important component of raw opium, that he called codeine, currently a widely used opium-derived compound. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === There are anecdotal reports of the recreational use of over-the-counter drugs in several countries, being readily available from local pharmacies without a prescription. The effects, beginning around 45 to 120 minutes after consumption, are similar to dextromethorphan and alcohol intoxication. Unlike dextromethorphan, noscapine is not an NMDA receptor antagonist. === Noscapine in heroin === Noscapine can survive the manufacturing processes of heroin and can be found in street heroin. This is useful for law enforcement agencies, as the amounts of contaminants can identify the source of seized drugs. In 2005 in Liège, Belgium, the average noscapine concentration was around 8%. Noscapine has also been used to identify drug users who are taking street heroin at the same time as prescribed diamorphine. Since the diamorphine in street heroin is the same as the pharmaceutical diamorphine, examination of the contaminants is the only way to test whether street heroin has been used. Other contaminants used in urine samples alongside noscapine include papaverine and acetylcodeine. Noscapine is metabolised by the body, and is itself rarely found in urine, instead being present as the primary metabolites, cotarnine and meconine. Detection is performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) but can also use a variety of other analytical techniques. == Research == === Clinical trials === The efficacy of noscapine in the treatment of certain hematological malignancies has been explored in the clinic. Polyploidy induction by noscapine has been observed in vitro in human lymphocytes at high dose levels (>30 μM); however, low-level systemic exposure, e.g. with cough medications, does not appear to present a genotoxic hazard. The mechanism of polyploidy induction by noscapine is suggested to involve either chromosome spindle apparatus damage or cell fusion. === Noscapine biosynthesis reconstitution === Many of the enzymes in the noscapine biosynthetic pathway was elucidated by the discovery of a 10 gene ""operon-like cluster"" named HN1. In 2016, the biosynthetic pathway of noscapine was reconstituted in yeast cells, allowing the drug to be synthesised without the requirement of harvest and purification from plant material. In 2018, the entire noscapine pathway was reconstituted and produced in yeast from simple molecules. In addition, protein expression was optimised in yeast, allowing production of noscapine to be improved 18,000 fold. It is hoped that this technology could be used to produce pharmaceutical alkaloids such as noscapine which are currently expressed at too low a yield in plantae to be mass-produced, allowing them to become marketable therapeutic drugs. === Anticancer derivatives === Noscapine is itself an antimitotic agent, therefore its analogs have great potential as novel anti-cancer drugs. Analogs having significant cytotoxic effects through modified 1,3-benzodioxole moiety have been developed. Similarly, N-alkyl amine, 1,3-diynyl, 9-vinyl-phenyl and 9-arylimino derivatives of noscapine have also been developed. Their mechanism of action is through tubulin inhibition. === Anti-inflammatory effects === Various studies have indicated that noscapine has anti-inflammatory effects and significantly reduces the levels of proinflammatory factors such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IFN-c, and IL-6. In this regard, in another study, Khakpour et al. examined the effect of noscapine against carrageenan-induced inflammation in rats. They found that noscapine at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight in three hours after the injection has the most anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, they showed that the amount of inflammation reduction at this dose of noscapine is approximately equal to indomethacin, a standard anti-inflammatory medication. Furthermore, Shiri et al. concluded that noscapine prevented the progression of bradykinin-induced inflammation in the rat's foot by antagonising bradykinin receptors. In addition, Zughaier et al. evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of brominated noscapine. The brominated form of noscapine has been shown to inhibit the secretion of the cytokine TNF-α and the chemokine CXCL10 from macrophages, thereby reducing inflammation without affecting macrophage survival. Furthermore, the bromated derivative of noscapine has about 5 to 40 times more potent effects than noscapine. Again, this brominated derivative also inhibits toll-like receptors (TLR), TNF-α, and nitric oxide (NO) in human and mouse macrophages without causing toxicity. == See also == Cough syrup Codeine; Pholcodine Dextromethorphan; Dimemorfan Racemorphan; Dextrorphan; Levorphanol Butamirate Pentoxyverine Tipepidine Cloperastine Levocloperastine Narceine, a related opium alkaloid. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
16	Ensulizole	WIKIPEDIA	Ensulizole (INN; also known as phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid) is a common sunscreen agent. In 1999, the United States Food and Drug Administration regulated that the name ensulizole be used on sunscreen labels in the United States. Ensulizole is primarily a UVB protecting agent providing only minimal UVA protection. The scope of UVB is 290 to 340 nanometers whereas the UVA range is 320 to 400 nanometers. For better UVA protection, it must be paired with avobenzone, titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide; outside of the United States it can also be paired with a UV absorber of the Tinosorb or Mexoryl types. Because ensulizole is water-soluble, it has the characteristic of feeling lighter on skin. As such, it is often used in sunscreen lotions or moisturizers whose aesthetic goal is a non-greasy finish. The free acid is poorly soluble in water, so it is only used as its soluble salts. == References == == External links == Thomson MICROMEDEX - Sunscreen Agents (Topical) Phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid	PERSONAL CARE	PERSONAL CARE	{'PERSON': -9.849109e-06, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}
17	Ethacridine	WIKIPEDIA	Ethacridine lactate (ethacridine monolactate monohydrate, acrinol, trade name Rivanol) is an aromatic organic compound based on acridine. Its formal name is 2-ethoxy-6,9-diaminoacridine monolactate monohydrate. It forms orange-yellow crystals with a melting point of 226 °C and it has a stinging smell. Its primary use is as an antiseptic in solutions of 0.1%. It is effective against mostly Gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococci and Staphylococci, but ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethacridine is also used as an agent for second trimester abortion. Up to 150 ml of a 0.1% solution is instilled extra-amniotically using a foley catheter. After 20 to 40 hours, 'mini labor' ensues. In China, an intra-amniotic method has also been used. Ethacridine as an abortifacient is found to be safer and better tolerated than 20% hypertonic saline. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
19	Genistin	WIKIPEDIA	"Genistin is an isoflavone found in a number of dietary plants like soy and kudzu. It was first isolated in 1931 from the 90% methanol extract of a soybean meal, when it was found that hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid produced 1 mole each of genistein and glucose. Chemically it is the 7-O-beta-D-glucoside form of genistein and is the predominant form of the isoflavone naturally occurring in plants. In fact, studies in the 1970s revealed that 99% of the isoflavonoid compounds in soy are present as their glucosides. The glucosides are converted by digestive enzymes in the digestive system to exert their biological effects. Genistin is also converted to a more familiar genistein, thus, the biological activities including antiatherosclerotic, estrogenic and anticancer effects are analogous. == Metabolism == When ingested along the diet, genistin is readily converted to its aglycone form, genistein. It is hydrolyzed by removing the covalently bound glucose to form genistein and that genistein is the form of the compound that is absorbed in the intestine and is the form responsible for the biological activities of the isoflavone. The digestive metabolism was first demonstrated in 2002 that the gut microflora played a large role in the conversion of genistin to genistein. It was later found that enzymes present in the human small intestine and liver also have the ability to convert the isoflavone. Hydrolysis actually starts very quickly in the digestive system once genistin is ingested, conversion begins in the mouth and then continues in the small intestine. Moreover, both human saliva and the intestinal cell-free extract from mice can cause the complete conversion. == Biological importance == === Estrogenic activity === Genistin, like genistein, is a phytoestrogen as it was shown to stimulate estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell growth in vivo. At a concentration of 1200 ppm, genistin caused significant increase of growth of breast tumors (MCF-7), cellular proliferation and estrogen-responsive pS2 gene expression in mice. Removal of genistin or genistein from the diet caused tumors to regress. === Antiviral activity === Genistin and other isoflavones are demonstrated to be bioactive within the neonatal intestine and may reduce the severity of rotavirus infections; genistin alone shows inhibition of the viral infectivity by 40-60%. === Bone metabolism === In vitro study have shown that both genistin and genistein are capable of enhancing bone metabolism in the femoral-metaphyseal tissues of elderly rats. The presence of genistein or genistin in the tissue culture caused a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and calcium contents. The effect of genistein was greater than that of genistin. It is also revealed that genistin has a strong bone loss preventive activity on experimental rats, and is especially enhanced by combination with fructooligosaccharides. The amount of new bone produced by grafting genistin in collagen matrix was compared to the bone produced by collagen matrix alone in New Zealand white rabbits, and was observed that genistin caused significant increase in bone formation. == References == == External links == ""Genistin (Genistein-7-O-β-D-glucoside)"".

20	9h-pyrido[3,4-b]indole	PUBMED	 Occupational and tobacco exposure to aromatic amines (AAs) including 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) and 2-naphthylamine (2-NA) are associated with bladder cancer (BC) risk. Several epidemiological studies have also reported a possible role for structurally related heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) formed in tobacco smoke or cooked meats with BC risk. We had screened for DNA adducts of 4-ABP, 2-NA, and several prominent HAAs formed in tobacco smoke or grilled meats including 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylmidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AαC) in the bladder DNA of BC patients, using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. We detected DNA adducts of 4-ABP, but not adducts of the other carcinogens. In this study, we have examined the capacity of RT4 cells, an epithelial human bladder cell line, to bioactivate AAs and HAAs to DNA damaging agents, which may contribute to BC. 4-ABP and AαC formed DNA adducts, but DNA adducts of 2-NA, PhIP, and MeIQx were not detected. 4-ABP DNA adducts were formed at tenfold higher levels than AαC adducts. Pretreatment of RT4 cells with α-naphthoflavone (1-10 µM), a specific cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1) inhibitor, decreased AαC adduct formation by 50% but did not affect the level of 4-ABP adducts. However, cell pretreatment with 8-methoxypsoralen (0.1-1 µM), a potent inhibitor of CYP2A, resulted in a 90% decrease of 4-ABP DNA adducts levels. These data signify that CYP2A and CYP1A isoforms expressed in the target urothelium bioactivate 4-ABP and AαC, respectively, and may be a critical feature of aromatic amine-induced urinary bladder carcinogenesis. The bioactivation of other tobacco and environmental AAs by bladder CYPs and their ensuing bladder DNA damage warrants further study. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a late-life neurodegenerative disease. Genetic and environmental factors play an etiological role. Harmane (1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole) is a potent tremor-producing neurotoxin that shows structural resemblance to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). In 2002 and 2007, we demonstrated elevated blood harmane concentrations [HA] in essential tremor (ET) cases. We now assessed whether blood [HA] were elevated in Parkinson's disease (PD) as well. Blood [HA] were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. Subjects comprised 113 PD cases and 101 controls. Mean log blood [HA] in PD cases was double that of controls (0.59±0.63 g(-10)/ml vs. 0.27±0.63 g(-10)/ml, p<0.001). A non-parametric test on non-transformed data (median blood [HA]=3.31 g(-10)/ml in cases and 1.44 g(-10)/ml in controls) also showed this difference (p<0.001). In unadjusted and then adjusted logistic regression analyses, log blood [HA] was associated with PD (odds ratio [OR]unadjusted 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.46-3.67, p<0.001; OR(adjusted) 2.54, 95% CI 1.55-4.16, p<0.001). In PD, log blood [HA] co-varied with family history, being lowest in PD cases with no family history (0.54±0.60 g(-10)/ml) and highest in PD cases with a family history of both ET and PD (0.84±0.68 g(-10)/ml) (p=0.06). Blood harmane appears to be elevated in PD. The finding needs to be reproduced in additional cohorts to assess its generalizability. The higher concentration in familial PD suggests that the mechanism may involve genetic factors.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.120398864}
21	Kynurenic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Kynurenic acid (KYNA or KYN) is a product of the normal metabolism of amino acid L-tryptophan. It has been shown that kynurenic acid possesses neuroactive activity. It acts as an antiexcitotoxic and anticonvulsant, most likely through acting as an antagonist at excitatory amino acid receptors. Because of this activity, it may influence important neurophysiological and neuropathological processes. As a result, kynurenic acid has been considered for use in therapy in certain neurobiological disorders. Conversely, increased levels of kynurenic acid have also been linked to certain pathological conditions. Kynurenic acid was discovered in 1853 by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in dog urine, which it was apparently named after. It is formed from L-kynurenine in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme kynurenine—oxoglutarate transaminase. == Mechanism of action == KYNA has been proposed to act on five targets: As an antagonist at ionotropic AMPA, NMDA and Kainate glutamate receptors in the concentration range of 0.1-2.5 mM. As a noncompetitive antagonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor. As an antagonist of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, recently (2011) direct recording of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor currents in adult (noncultured) hippocampal interneurons by the Cooper laboratory validated a 2009 study that failed to find any blocking effect of kynurenic acid across a wide range of concentrations, thus suggesting that in noncultured, intact preparations from adult animals there is no effect of kynurenic acid on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor currents. As a ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35. As an agonist for the G protein-coupled receptor HCAR3. == Role in disease == High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in patients with tick-borne encephalitis, schizophrenia and HIV-related illnesses. In all these situations, increased levels were associated with confusion and psychotic symptoms. Kynurenic acid acts in the brain as a glycine-site NMDAr antagonist, key in glutamatergic neurotransmission system, which is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The kynurenic acid hypothesis of schizophrenia was proposed in 2007, based on its action on midbrain dopamine activity and NMDArs, thus linking dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia with the glutamate hypothesis of the disease. Kynurenic acid is reduced in individuals with mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, especially during depressive episodes. High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in human urine in certain metabolic disorders, such as marked pyridoxine deficiency and deficiency/absence of kynureninase. When researchers decreased the levels of kynurenic acid in the brains of mice, their cognition was shown to improve markedly. However, kynurenic acid also shows neuroprotective properties. Some researchers have posited that the increased levels found in cases of neurological degradation is due to a failed attempt to protect the cells. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid compared to kynurenine appear to be associated with poorer T cell response and higher mortality in male subjects with COVID-19, suggesting an explanation for the poorer clinical outcomes observed in males than in females. == Link to ketogenic diet == One controlled study kept mice on a ketogenic diet and measured kynurenic acid concentrations in different parts of the brain. It found that the mice on the ketogenic diet had greater kynurenic acid concentrations in the striatum and hippocampus compared to mice on a normal diet, with no significant difference in the cortex. In response to the studies showing detrimental behaviour following increases in kynurenic acid the authors also note that the diet was generally well tolerated by the animals, with no ""gross behavioural abnormalities"". They posit that the increases in concentrations found were insufficient to produce behavioural changes seen in those studies. == See also == Xanthurenic acid == References == == External links == Link found between TBE and schizophrenia - TheLocal.se, Sweden's news in English, 6 November 2007."

22	Kynurenine	WIKIPEDIA	l-Kynurenine is a metabolite of the amino acid l-tryptophan used in the production of niacin. Kynurenine is synthesized by the enzyme tryptophan dioxygenase, which is made primarily but not exclusively in the liver, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which is made in many tissues in response to immune activation. Kynurenine and its further breakdown products carry out diverse biological functions, including dilating blood vessels during inflammation and regulating the immune response. Some cancers increase kynurenine production, which increases tumor growth. Kynurenine protects the eye by absorbing UV light, especially in the UVA region (315–400 nm). Kynurenine is present in the lens and retina as one of multiple tryptophan derivatives produced in the eye, including 3-hydroxykynurenine, that together provide UV protection and aid in enhancing visual acuity. The use of kynurenine as a UV filter is consistent with its photostability and low photosensitization, owing to its efficient relaxation from the UV-induced excited state. The concentration of this UV filter decreases with age, and this loss of free kynurenine and the concomitant formation of relatively more photosensitizing kynurenine derivatives and kynurenine-protein conjugates may contribute to the formation of cataracts. Evidence suggests that increased kynurenine production may precipitate depressive symptoms associated with interferon treatment for hepatitis C. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated with imbalances in the enzymes that break down kynurenine. Blood levels of kynurenine are reduced in people with bipolar disorder. Kynurenine production is increased in Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease where its metabolites are associated with cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms. Kynurenine is also associated with tics. Kynureninase catabolizes the conversion of kynurenine into anthranilic acid while kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase catabolizes its conversion into kynurenic acid. Kynurenine 3-hydroxylase converts kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine. Kynurenine has also been identified as one of two compounds that makes up the pigment that gives the goldenrod crab spider its yellow color. == Kynurenine pathway dysfunction == Dysfunctional states of distinct steps of the kynurenine pathway (such as kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine) have been described for a number of disorders, including: HIV dementia Tourette syndrome Tic disorders Psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, anxiety disorders) Multiple sclerosis Huntington's disease Encephalopathies Lipid metabolism Liver fat metabolism Systemic lupus erythematosus Glutaric aciduria Vitamin B6 deficiency Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Downregulation of kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) can be caused by genetic polymorphisms, cytokines, or both. KMO deficiency leads to an accumulation of kynurenine and to a shift within the tryptophan metabolic pathway towards kynurenine acid and anthranilic acid. Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase deficiency is associated with disorders of the brain (e.g. major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, tic disorders) and of the liver. == Drug development == It is hypothesized that the kynurenine pathway is partly responsible for the therapeutic effect of lithium on bipolar disorder. If that is the case, it could be a target of drug discovery. == See also == Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) N′-Formylkynurenine == References ==	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': -4.3202e-07, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
25	Piperine	WIKIPEDIA	"Piperine, possibly along with its isomer chavicine, is the compound responsible for the pungency of black pepper and long pepper. It has been used in some forms of traditional medicine. == Preparation == Due to its poor solubility in water, piperine is typically extracted from black pepper by using organic solvents like dichloromethane. The amount of piperine varies from 1–2% in long pepper, to 5–10% in commercial white and black peppers. Piperine can also be prepared by treating the solvent-free residue from a concentrated alcoholic extract of black pepper with a solution of potassium hydroxide to remove resin (said to contain chavicine, an isomer of piperine). The solution is decanted from the insoluble residue and left to stand overnight in alcohol. During this period, the alkaloid slowly crystallizes from the solution. Piperine has been synthesized by the action of piperonoyl chloride on piperidine. == Reactions == Piperine forms salts only with strong acids. The platinichloride B4·H2PtCl6 forms orange-red needles (""B"" denotes one mole of the alkaloid base in this and the following formula). Iodine in potassium iodide added to an alcoholic solution of the base in the presence of a little hydrochloric acid gives a characteristic periodide, B2·HI·I2, crystallizing in steel-blue needles with melting point 145 °C. Piperine can be hydrolyzed by an alkali into piperidine and piperic acid. In light, especially ultraviolet light, piperine is changed into its isomers chavicine, isochavicine and isopiperine, which are tasteless. == History == Piperine was discovered in 1819 by Hans Christian Ørsted, who isolated it from the fruits of Piper nigrum, the source plant of both black and white pepper. Piperine was also found in Piper longum and Piper officinarum (Miq.) C. DC.

27	Carbendazim	WIKIPEDIA	Carbendazim is a fungicide, a member benzimidazole fungicides. It is a metabolite of benomyl. The fungicide is used to control plant diseases in cereals and fruits, including citrus, bananas, strawberries, macadamia nuts, pineapples, and pomes. A 4.7% solution of carbendazim hydrochloride, sold as Eertavas, is marketed as a treatment for Dutch elm disease. == Other uses == It is also employed as a casting worm control agent in amenity turf situations such as golf greens, tennis courts etc. and in some countries is licensed for that use only. == Safety, regulation, controversy == High doses of carbendazim destroy the testicles of laboratory animals. Maximum pesticide residue limits (MRLs) for fresh produce in the EU are between 0.1 and 0.7 mg/kg with the exception of loquat fruits, which is set at 2 mg/kg. The limits for more commonly consumed citrus and pome fruits are between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg.

32	Hyodeoxycholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Hyodeoxycholic acid, also known as 3α,6α-Dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid or HDCA, is a secondary bile acid, one of the metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria. It differs from deoxycholic acid in that the 6α-hydroxyl is in the 12 position in the former. The 6α-hydroxyl group makes HDCA a hydrophilic acid, a property it shares with hyocholic acid. HDCA is present in mammalian species in different proportions. It is the main acid constituent of hog bile, and for this reason it was used industrially as precursor for steroid synthesis before total synthesis became practical. == Metabolism == In rat intestinal microflora hyodeoxycholic acid is produced by a Gram-positive rod—termed HDCA-1—from several isomers of hyocholic acid and muricholic acid. In pigs with a normal gastrointestinal flora the majority of hyodeoxycholic acid found in bile is of secondary nature, but a small amount was also found in germ free pigs, which supports the hypothesis that HDCA may be a primary bile acid in this species. In healthy humans only traces of HDCA have been found in urine, but in patients with cholestatic liver disease or intestinal malabsorption a significant amount has been found excreted. Hyodeoxycholic acid undergoes glucuronidation in human liver and kidneys. Glucuronidation of hyodeoxycholic and hyocholic acids was observed to occur extensively at the 6α-hydroxyl group, unlike primary bile acids which form 3α-hydroxy-linked glucuronides. This suggests an important pathway for the elimination of toxic and cholestatic bile acids, e.g. lithocholic and chenodeoxycholic acids which can form hyodeoxycholic and hyocholic acids, respectively, after 6α-hydroxilation. The enzyme family responsible for glucosidation of hyodeoxycholic acid in human liver is UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. Both the UGT2B4 and UGT2B7 isoforms are able to glucuronidate HDCA. This is an example of redundancy in protection against harmful endogenous compounds provided by UGT isoforms, which present distinct but frequently overlapping substrate specificity. A common amino-acid residue that confers these two isoforms specificity to HDCA has been identified in 2006. Animal model studies support the concept that bile acids may play a role in the development of colon cancer. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) is believed to be tumor promoter, while ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was found to suppress the development of colon tumors. The mechanism that accounts for this difference in function is not clear. In vitro studies found that DCA induces apoptosis in some colon cancer cell lines, while UDCA arrests cell proliferation without inducing apoptosis. In these studies HDCA exhibited biological activity that is intermediate to DCA and UDCA, arresting growth for a time, but causing apoptosis after extended exposure. == Applications == It was known since 1939 that HDCA could be used to synthesize progesterone. A decade later, an analysis of the composition of hog bile determined that HDCA accounted for approximately 40% of its acid contents. In the 1950s, lacking access to vegetal precursors of steroids, like diosgenin, the East German company Jenapharm used hyodeoxycholic acid extracted from hog bile as the sole precursor for steroid synthesis. In the 1980s, hyodeoxycholic acid was investigated for its propensity to prevent cholesterol-induced gallstones in animals fed with a lithogenic diet. Another animal study determined that oral administration of HDCA leads to a decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentration, a strong stimulation of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis and an excessive loss of cholesterol in feces. Unlike ursodeoxycholic acid, which is an approved drug for the treatment of gallstones, HDCA is not marketed for any medical condition. In supramolecular chemistry a molecular tweezer based on a hyodeoxycholic acid showed a high selectivity the towards the fluorine radical. == See also == Chenodeoxycholic acid for a similar molecular tweezer which exhibits different selectivity == References ==	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL	{'END': -0.03179828, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -0.25513217, ' IND': -0.30667117, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0}
37	Amitriptyline	WIKIPEDIA	"Amitriptyline, sold under the brand name Elavil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, and a variety of pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, migraine and tension headaches. Due to the frequency and prominence of side effects, amitriptyline is generally considered a second-line therapy for these indications. The most common side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain. Glaucoma, liver toxicity and abnormal heart rhythms are rare but serious side effects. Blood levels of amitriptyline vary significantly from one person to another, and amitriptyline interacts with many other medications potentially aggravating its side effects. Amitriptyline was discovered in the late 1950s by scientists at Merck and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 87th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amitriptyline is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder, neuropathic pain, and for the prevention of migraine and chronic tension headache. It can be used for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children older than 6 after other treatments have failed. === Depression === Amitriptyline is effective for depression, but it is rarely used as a first-line antidepressant due to its higher toxicity in overdose and generally poorer tolerability. It can be tried for depression as a second-line therapy, after the failure of other treatments. For treatment-resistant adolescent depression or for cancer-related depression amitriptyline is no better than placebo; however, the number of treated patients in both studies was small. It is sometimes used for the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease, but supporting evidence for that is lacking. === Pain === Amitriptyline alleviates painful diabetic neuropathy. It is recommended by a variety of guidelines as a first or second-line treatment. It is as effective for this indication as gabapentin or pregabalin but less well tolerated. Amitriptyline is as effective at relieving pain as duloxetine. Combination treatment of amitriptyline and pregabalin offers additional pain relief for people whose pain is not adequately controlled with one medication and is usually safe. Amitriptyline in certain formulations may also induce the level of sciatic-nerve blockade needed for local anesthesia therein. Here, it has been demonstrated to be of superior potency to bupivacaine, a customary long-acting local anesthetic. Low doses of amitriptyline moderately improve sleep disturbances and reduce pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. It is recommended for fibromyalgia accompanied by depression by Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany and as a second-line option for fibromyalgia, with exercise being the first line option, by European League Against Rheumatism. Combinations of amitriptyline and fluoxetine or melatonin may reduce fibromyalgia pain better than either medication alone. There is some (low-quality) evidence that amitriptyline may reduce pain in cancer patients. It is recommended only as a second-line therapy for non-chemotherapy-induced neuropathic or mixed neuropathic pain if opioids did not provide the desired effect. Moderate evidence exists in favor of amitriptyline use for atypical facial pain. Amitriptyline is ineffective for HIV-associated neuropathy. In multiple sclerosis, it is frequently used to treat painful paresthesias in the arms and legs (e.g., burning sensations, pins and needles, stabbing pains) caused by damage to the pain-regulating pathways of the brain and spinal cord. === Headache === Amitriptyline is probably effective for the prevention of periodic migraine in adults. Amitriptyline is similar in efficacy to venlafaxine and topiramate but carries a higher burden of adverse effects than topiramate. For many patients, even very small doses of amitriptyline are helpful, which may allow for minimization of side effects. Amitriptyline is not significantly different from placebo when used for the prevention of migraine in children. Amitriptyline may reduce the frequency and duration of chronic tension headache, but it is associated with worse adverse effects than mirtazapine. Overall, amitriptyline is recommended for tension headache prophylaxis, along with lifestyle advice, which should include avoidance of analgesia and caffeine. === Other indications === Amitriptyline is effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome; however, because of its side effects, it should be reserved for select patients for whom other agents do not work. There is insufficient evidence to support its use for abdominal pain in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Tricyclic antidepressants decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of cyclic vomiting syndrome episodes. Amitriptyline, as the most commonly used of them, is recommended as a first-line agent for its therapy. Amitriptyline may improve pain and urgency intensity associated with bladder pain syndrome and can be used in the management of this syndrome. Amitriptyline can be used in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children. However, its effect is not sustained after the treatment ends. Alarm therapy gives better short- and long-term results. In the US, amitriptyline is commonly used in children with ADHD as an adjunct to stimulant medications without any evidence or guideline supporting this practice. Many physicians in the UK (and the US also) commonly prescribe amitriptyline for insomnia; however, Cochrane reviewers were not able to find any randomized controlled studies that would support or refute this practice. Similarly, a major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of amitriptyline for insomnia. The well-known sedating effects of amitriptyline, however, bear understanding on and arguable justification for this practice. It may function similarly to doxepin in this regard, although the evidence for doxepin is more robust. Trimipramine may be a more novel alternative given its tendency to not suppress but brighten R.E.M. sleep. == Contraindications and precautions == The known contraindications of amitriptyline are: Amitriptyline should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy, impaired liver function, pheochromocytoma, urinary retention, prostate enlargement, hyperthyroidism, and pyloric stenosis. In patients with the rare condition of shallow anterior chamber of eyeball and narrow anterior chamber angle, amitriptyline may provoke attacks of acute glaucoma due to dilation of the pupil. It may aggravate psychosis, if used for depression with schizophrenia, or precipitate the switch to mania in those with bipolar disorder. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should avoid amitriptyline due to increased side effects. If it is necessary to use it, half dose is recommended. Amitriptyline can be used during pregnancy and lactation when SSRIs have been shown not to work. == Side effects == The most frequent side effects, occurring in 20% or more of users, are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain (on average 1.8 kg). Other common side effects are headache problems (amblyopia, blurred vision), tachycardia, increased appetite, tremor, fatigue/asthenia/feeling slowed down, and dyspepsia. A less common side effect of amitriptyline is urination problems (8.7%). Amitriptyline can increase suicidal thoughts and behavior in people under the age of 24 and the US FDA required a boxed warning to be added to the prescription label. Amitriptyline-associated sexual dysfunction (occurring at a frequency of 6.9%) seems to be mostly confined to males with depression and is expressed predominantly as erectile dysfunction and low libido disorder, with lesser frequency of ejaculatory and orgasmic problems. The rate of sexual dysfunction in males treated for indications other than depression and in females is not significantly different from placebo. Liver test abnormalities occur in 10–12% of patients on amitriptyline, but are usually mild, asymptomatic, and transient, with consistently elevated alanine transaminase in 3% of all patients. The increases of the enzymes above the 3-fold threshold of liver toxicity are uncommon, and cases of clinically apparent liver toxicity are rare; nevertheless, amitriptyline is placed in the group of antidepressants with greater risks of hepatic toxicity. Amitriptyline prolongs the QT interval. This prolongation is relatively small at therapeutic doses but becomes severe in overdose. == Overdose == The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other TCAs, including the presentation of serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. The British National Formulary notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose, thus it and other TCAs are no longer recommended as first-line therapy for depression. The treatment of overdose is mostly supportive as no specific antidote for amitriptyline overdose is available. Activated charcoal may reduce absorption if given within 1–2 hours of ingestion. If the affected person is unconscious or has an impaired gag reflex, a nasogastric tube may be used to deliver the activated charcoal into the stomach. ECG monitoring for cardiac conduction abnormalities is essential and if one is found close monitoring of cardiac function is advised. Body temperature should be regulated with measures such as heating blankets if necessary. Cardiac monitoring is advised for at least five days after the overdose. Benzodiazepines are recommended to control seizures. Dialysis is of no use due to the high degree of protein binding with amitriptyline. == Interactions == Since amitriptyline and its active metabolite nortriptyline are primarily metabolized by cytochromes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 (see its pharmacology), the inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to exhibit pharmacokinetic interactions with amitriptyline. According to the prescribing information, the interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the plasma level of amitriptyline. However, the results in the other literature are inconsistent: the co-administration of amitriptyline with a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine does increase the plasma levels of amitriptyline two-fold and of the main active metabolite nortriptyline 1.5-fold, but combination with less potent CYP2D6 inhibitors thioridazine or levomepromazine does not affect the levels of amitriptyline and increases nortriptyline by about 1.5-fold; a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor fluoxetine does not seem to have a significant effect on the levels of amitriptyline or nortriptyline. A case of clinically significant interaction with potent CYP2D6 inhibitor terbinafine has been reported. A potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes fluvoxamine increases the level of amitriptyline two-fold while slightly decreasing the level of nortriptyline. Similar changes occur with a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes cimetidine: amitriptyline level increases by about 70%, while nortriptyline decreases by 50%. CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole elevates amitriptyline level by about a quarter. On the other hand, cytochrome P450 inducers such as carbamazepine and St. John's Wort decrease the levels of both amitriptyline and nortriptyline Oral contraceptives may increase the blood level of amitriptyline by as high as 90%. Valproate moderately increases the levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline through an unclear mechanism. The prescribing information warns that the combination of amitriptyline with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may cause potentially lethal serotonin syndrome; however, this has been disputed. The prescribing information cautions that some patients may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate. However, other literature states that there is little or no interaction: in a pharmacokinetic study topiramate only increased the level of amitriptyline by 20% and nortriptyline by 33%. Amitriptyline counteracts the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. When given with amitriptyline, other anticholinergic agents may result in hyperpyrexia or paralytic ileus. Co-administration of amitriptyline and disulfiram is not recommended due to the potential for the development of toxic delirium. Amitriptyline causes an unusual type of interaction with the anticoagulant phenprocoumon during which great fluctuations of the prothrombin time have been observed. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Amitriptyline inhibits serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). It is metabolized to nortriptyline, a stronger norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, further augmenting amitriptyline's effects on norepinephrine reuptake (see table in this section). Amitriptyline additionally acts as a potent inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, the α1A-adrenergic, the histamine H1 and the M1-M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see table in this section). Amitriptyline is a non-selective blocker of multiple ion channels, in particular, voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.3, Nav1.5, Nav1.6, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8, voltage-gated potassium channels Kv7.2/ Kv7.3, Kv7.1, Kv7.1/KCNE1, and hERG. === Mechanism of action === Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters by amitriptyline results in interference with neuronal reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Since the reuptake process is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity, this action may potentiate or prolong the activity of serotonergic and adrenergic neurons and is believed to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline. Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake leads to an increased concentration of norepinephrine in the posterior gray column of the spinal cord appears to be mostly responsible for the analgesic action of amitriptyline. Increased level of norepinephrine increases the basal activity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which mediate an analgesic effect by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission among spinal interneurons. The blocking effect of amitriptyline on sodium channels may also contribute to its efficacy in pain conditions. === Pharmacokinetics === Amitriptyline is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (90–95%). Absorption is gradual with the peak concentration in blood plasma reached after about 4 hours. Extensive metabolism on the first pass through the liver leads to average bioavailability of about 50% (45%-53%). Amitriptyline is metabolized mostly by CYP2C19 into nortriptyline and by CYP2D6 leading to a variety of hydroxylated metabolites, with the principal one among them being (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline (see metabolism scheme), and to a lesser degree, by CYP3A4. Nortriptyline, the main active metabolite of amitriptyline, is an antidepressant on its own right. Nortriptyline reaches 10% higher level in the blood plasma than the parent drug amitriptyline and 40% greater area under the curve, and its action is an important part of the overall action of amitriptyline. Another active metabolite is (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline, which is a norepinephrine uptake inhibitor four times weaker than nortriptyline. (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline blood level is comparable to that of nortriptyline, but its cerebrospinal fluid level, which is a close proxy of the brain concentration of a drug, is twice higher than nortriptyline's. Based on this, (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline was suggested to significantly contribute to the antidepressant effects of amitriptyline. Blood levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline and pharmacokinetics of amitriptyline in general, with clearance difference of up to 10-fold, vary widely between individuals. Variability of the area under the curve in steady state is also high, which makes a slow upward titration of the dose necessary. In the blood, amitriptyline is 96% bound to plasma proteins; nortriptyline is 93–95% bound, and (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline is about 60% bound. Amitriptyline has an elimination half life of 21 hours, nortriptyline – 23–31 hours, and (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline − 8–10 hours. Within 48 hours, 12−80% of amitriptyline is eliminated in the urine, mostly as metabolites. 2% of the unchanged drug is excreted in the urine. Elimination in the feces, apparently, have not been studied. Therapeutic levels of amitriptyline range from 75 to 175 ng/mL (270–631 nM), or 80–250 ng/mL of both amitriptyline and its metabolite nortriptyline. === Pharmacogenetics === Since amitriptyline is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, genetic variations within the genes coding for these enzymes can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of amitriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have ""normal"" metabolism of amitriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use amitriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. The consortium also recommends considering an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19 in patients who are CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. A reduction in the starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If the use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. == Chemistry == Amitriptyline is a highly lipophilic molecule having an octanol-water partition coefficient (pH 7.4) of 3.0, while the log P of the free base was reported as 4.92. Solubility of the free base amitriptyline in water is 14 mg/L. Amitriptyline is prepared by reacting dibenzosuberane with 3-(dimethylamino)propylmagnesium chloride and then heating the resulting intermediate product with hydrochloric acid to eliminate water. == History == Amitriptyline was first developed by the American pharmaceutical company Merck in the late 1950s. In 1958, Merck approached several clinical investigators proposing to conduct clinical trials of amitriptyline for schizophrenia. One of these researchers, Frank Ayd, instead, suggested using amitriptyline for depression. Ayd treated 130 patients and, in 1960, reported that amitriptyline had antidepressant properties similar to another, and the only known at the time, tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. Following this, the US Food and Drug Administration approved amitriptyline for depression in 1961. In Europe, due to a quirk of the patent law at the time allowing patents only on the chemical synthesis but not on the drug itself, Roche and Lundbeck were able to independently develop and market amitriptyline in the early 1960s. According to research by a historian of psychopharmacology David Healy, amitriptyline became a much bigger selling drug than its precursor imipramine because of two factors. First, amitriptyline has a much stronger anxiolytic effect. Second, Merck conducted a marketing campaign raising clinicians' awareness of depression as a clinical entity. == Society and culture == In the 2021 film The Many Saints of Newark, amitriptyline (referred to by the brand name Elavil) is part of the plot line of the movie. === Names === Amitriptyline is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while amitriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are amitriptilina, in German is Amitriptylin, and in Latin is amitriptylinum. The embonate salt is known as amitriptyline embonate, which is its BANM, or as amitriptyline pamoate unofficially. === Prescription trends === Between 1998 and 2017, along with imipramine, amitriptyline was the most commonly prescribed first antidepressant for children aged 5–11 years in England. It was also the most prescribed antidepressant (along with fluoxetine) for 12- to 17-year-olds. == Research == The few randomized controlled trials investigating amitriptyline efficacy in eating disorder have been discouraging. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == Further reading == Dean L (March 2017).

38	Xanthurenic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Xanthurenic acid, or xanthurenate, is a metabolic intermediate that accumulates and is excreted by pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficient animals after the ingestion of tryptophan. Xanthurenic acid is suspected to be an endogenous agonist for Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors in humans. It is also known to be a potent VGLUT inhibitor, thereby preventing the movement of glutamate from the cytoplasm into synaptic vesicles, an action that it mediates via competitive blockade of vesicular glutamate transporters (Ki = 0.19 mM). In 2015 researchers reported a marked reduction of xanthurenic acid levels in the serum of patients with schizophrenia. A recent meta-analysis showed that blood xanthurenic acid levels are lower in individuals suffering from bipolar disorder as well. Xanthurenic acid has also been shown to induce gametogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria. It is found in the gut of the Anopheles mosquito. == See also == Kynurenic acid 7-Chlorokynurenic acid == References ==	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': 0.0, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
40	Diosmin	WIKIPEDIA	"Diosmin (diosmetin 7-O-rutinoside), a flavone glycoside of diosmetin, is manufactured from citrus fruit peels as a phlebotonic non-prescription dietary supplement used to aid treatment of hemorrhoids or chronic venous diseases, mainly of the legs. == Uses == Diosmin is a dietary supplement used to aid treatment of hemorrhoids and venous diseases, i.e., chronic venous insufficiency including spider and varicose veins, leg swelling (edema), stasis dermatitis and venous ulcers. The mechanism of action of Diosmin and other phlebotonics is undefined, and clinical evidence of benefit is limited. Diosmin is not recommended for treating the rectal mucosa, skin irritations, or wounds, and should not be used to treat dermatitis, eczema, or urticaria. Diosmin is not recommended for use in children or women during pregnancy. There is moderate-quality evidence that diosmin or other phlebotonics improved leg and ankle swelling and lower leg pain, and low-quality evidence for treating hemorrhoids. === Phlebotonics === Diosmin is included among a small class of agents called ""phlebotonics"" having heterogeneous composition and consisting partly of citrus peel extracts (flavonoids, such as hesperidin) and synthetic compounds, which are used to treat chronic venous insufficiency or hemorrhoids. In 2017, the American Working Group in Chronic Venous Disease recommended use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction (diosmiplex) as a medical food for chronic venous disease symptoms and venous ulcers, having ""beneficial outcomes without serious adverse events"", alone or combined with compression therapy, concurring with the previous guidance of the International European Society for Vascular Surgery. The German Dermatological Society indicated that Diosmin may be used with other treatments for symptoms of chronic venous diseases. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons mentions phlebotonics as a possible treatment for symptoms of hemorrhoid grades I to II, as there is only moderate-quality evidence of effectiveness with ""expectations of minimal harm"", while having no evidence of long-term benefit. French, Indian, Portuguese, and Italian professional societies of coloproctology issued similar recommendations regarding phlebotonics for hemorrhoids. == Adverse effects == In some 10% of users, diosmin causes mild gastrointestinal disorders or skin irritations (hives, itching), stomach pain, nausea, heart arrhythmias, or anemia. Preliminary research indicates no evidence of toxicity. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded in 2001 that there was inadequate evidence on which to base an expectation of safety. As of 2013, the FDA did not revise this position. == Regulatory status == Diosmin is distributed in the U.S. as a dietary supplement called Daflon. Diosmin is not approved as a prescription drug in the United States, although it is available as over-the-counter or prescription-only drug in Europe sold under name Detralex among others. Phlebotonics are not approved in Germany, and are restricted in Spain only for the treatment of chronic venous diseases. == See also == Daflon Venalex == References =="	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.0007992654, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' FOOD': -5.3193703e-06}
42	Proanthocyanidin a1	PUBMED	 Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) is a severe adverse drug reaction, and the main reason for CIT is the destruction of megakaryocytes (MKs, precursor cells of platelet) in bone marrow by chemotherapy. Peanut skin, the seed coat of Arachis hypogaea L., is a traditional Chinese medicine commonly used to treat thrombocytopenia. However, its active compounds and the mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to clarify the active compounds of peanut skin to exhibit thrombogenic effects against CIT and their underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. The bioassay-guided isolation based on the proliferation of MKs was used to explore the possible platelet-enhancing ingredients in peanut skin. HSCCC technique coupled with preparative HPLC was used to separate the active compounds. Dami cells and carboplatin-treated mice model were used to evaluate the thrombogenic effects of PS-1. Network pharmacology, molecular docking, dynamics simulation studies, kinase activity, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), isothermal dose-response fingerprint (ITDRF Proanthocyanidin A1 (PS-1) and its stereoisomers (PS-2-4) were demonstrated to promote the proliferation of MKs (Dami cells), especially PS-1 (EC Proanthocyanins (PS-1-4) derived from peanut skin were first clarified as platelet-enhancing ingredients to improve CIT. The underlying mechanism of PS-1 was proved to promote the proliferation and differentiation of MKs via JAK2/STAT3 pathway both in vitro and in vivo. The first novel stereoselective synthesis of naturally occurring A1 (1) and A2 proanthocyanidins (2) has been achieved. The key synthetic steps involved (a) the formation of a coupled product (13 or 14) between an open chain C-ring C-4 hydroxyethoxy analogue of either (+)-catechin or (-)-epicatechin with 5,7,3',3'-tetra-O-benzyl-(+)-catechin/-(-)-epicatechin in the presence of bentonite clay K-10, (b) removal of benzyl protecting groups under mild catalytic hydrogenation conditions to form the desired A-type compound in situ as a mixture of diastereomers via ketal/oxonium ion/carbonium ion formation, and (c) separation of the diasteromers via silica gel column chromatography. The structures of A1 and A2 proanthocyanidins were unequivocally established by analytical comparison to the natural products. Following this methodology, an additional six diastereomers of proanthocyanidins A1 and A2 have been synthesized. A plausible mechanism for the formation of the A-type linkage in proanthocyanidins has been proposed.

43	Avobenzone	WIKIPEDIA	"Avobenzone (trade names Parsol 1789, Milestab 1789, Eusolex 9020, Escalol 517, Neo Heliopan 357 and others, INCI Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane) is an organic molecule and an oil-soluble ingredient used in sunscreen products to absorb the full spectrum of UVA rays. == History == Avobenzone was patented in 1973 and was approved in the EU in 1978. It was approved by the FDA in 1988. As of 2021, the FDA announced that they do not support avobenzone as being generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) citing the need for additional safety data. Avobenzone was banned in 2020 by the Palau government citing reef-toxicity concerns. == Properties == Pure avobenzone is a whitish to yellowish crystalline powder with a weak odor, dissolving in isopropanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, decyl oleate, capric acid/caprylic, triglycerides and other oils. It is not soluble in water. Avobenzone is a dibenzoylmethane derivative. Avobenzone exists in the ground state as a mixture of the enol and keto forms, favoring the chelated enol. This enol form is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen-bonding within the β-diketone. Its ability to absorb ultraviolet light over a wider range of wavelengths than many other sunscreen agents has led to its use in many commercial preparations marketed as ""broad spectrum"" sunscreens. Avobenzone has an absorption maximum of 357 nm. == Safety == Avobenzone, a petroleum-based sunscreen active ingredient, is not generally recognised as safe and effective (GRASE) by the FDA for lack of sufficient data to support this claim. However, it is still the only FDA approved UVA filter (up to 3% concentration). Avobenzone is also approved in all other jurisdictions, such as EU (up to 5%), Australia, and Japan. A 2017 study at Lomonosov Moscow State University found that chlorinated water and ultraviolet light can cause avobenzone to disintegrate into various other organic compounds, including; phenolic acids, aldehydes, phenols, and acetophenones which can cause adverse health effects. == Stability == Avobenzone is sensitive to the properties of the solvent, being relatively stable in polar protic solvents and unstable in nonpolar environments. Also, when it is irradiated with UVA light, it generates a triplet excited state in the keto form which can either cause the avobenzone to degrade or it can transfer energy to biological targets and cause deleterious effects. Avobenzone has been shown to degrade significantly in light, resulting in less protection over time. The UV-A light in a day of sunlight in a temperate climate is sufficient to break down most of the compound. Data presented to the Food and Drug Administration by the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association indicates a −36% change in avobenzone's UV absorbance following one hour of exposure to sunlight. For this reason, in sunscreen products, avobenzone is always formulated together with a photostabilizer, such as octocrylene. Other photostabilizers include: 4-Methylbenzylidene camphor (USAN Enzacamene) Tinosorb S (USAN Bemotrizinol, INCI Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine) Tinosorb M (USAN Bisoctrizole, INCI Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol) Butyloctyl Salicylate (Tradename HallBrite BHB - [1]) Hexadecyl Benzoate Butyloctyl Benzoate HallBrite PSF (INCI Undecylcrylene DimethiconeE) Mexoryl SX (USAN Ecamsule, INCI Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid) Synoxyl HSS (INCI Trimethoxybenzylidene Pentanedione) Corapan TQ (INCI Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate) Parsol SLX (INCI Polysilicone-15) Oxynex ST (INCI Diethylhexyl Syringylidene Malonate Polycrylene (INCI Polyester-8) SolaStay S1 (INCI Ethylhexyl Methoxycrylene) Octyl Salicylate (INCI Ethylhexyl Salicylate) Complexing avobenzone with cyclodextrins may also increase its photostability. Formulations of avobenzone with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin have shown significant reduction in photo-induced degradation, as well as decreased transdermal penetration of the UV absorber when used in high concentrations. The photostability of avobenzone is further increased when sunscreens are formulated with antioxidant compounds. Mangiferin, glutathione, ubiquinone, vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene and trans-resveratrol have all demonstrated some ability to protect avobenzone from photodegradation. The stability and efficacy of avobenzone seems to continue to increase as a greater amount of antioxidants are added to the sunscreen. According to some studies, ""the most effective sunscreens contain avobenzone and titanium dioxide."" Avobenzone can degrade faster in light in combination with mineral UV absorbers like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, though with the right coating of the mineral particles this reaction can be reduced. A manganese doped titanium dioxide may be better than undoped titanium dioxide to improve avobenzone's stability. === Various === As an enolate, avobenzone forms with heavy metal ions (such as Fe3+) colored complexes, and chelating agents can be added to suppress them. Stearates, aluminum, magnesium and zinc salts can lead to poorly soluble precipitates. Manufacturers also recommend to avoid the inclusion of iron and ferric salts, heavy metals, formaldehyde donors and PABA and PABA esters. Avobenzone in sunscreen may stain clothes yellow-orange and make them sticky if washed in iron-rich water, as it reacts with iron to produce rust. The damage can be undone with a rust remover or stain remover. The staining properties of sunblock made with avobenzone are particularly noticeable on fiberglass boats with white gelcoat. Avobenzone also reacts with boron trifluoride to form a stable crystalline complex that is highly fluorescent under UV irradiation. The emission color of the crystals depends on the molecular packing of the boron avobenzone complex. The photoluminescence may also be altered by mechanical force in the solid state, resulting in a phenomenon called ""mechanochromic luminescence"". The altered emission color recovers itself slowly at room temperature or more swiftly at higher temperatures. === Absorbance spectrum === Avobenzone has a peak absorbance around 360 nm when dissolved. The peak may shift slightly depending on the solvent. == Preparation == The compound is prepared by reacting 4-tert-butylbenzoic methyl ester (from 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid by esterification with methanol) with 4-methoxyacetophenone in toluene in the presence of sodium amide via Claisen condensation. According to a recent patent application, yields of up to 95% are obtained with the same starting materials in toluene in the presence of potassium methoxide. It is subject to keto-enol tautomerism and exists predominantly enol when dissolved. Upon UV radiation, it may convert to keto form, while converting back to enol form after placing in dark.

48	Thiabendazole	WIKIPEDIA	Tiabendazole (INN, BAN), also known as thiabendazole (AAN, USAN) or TBZ and the trade names Mintezol, Tresaderm, and Arbotect, is a preservative, an antifungal agent, and an antiparasitic agent. == Uses == === Preservative === Tiabendazole is used primarily to control mold, blight, and other fungal diseases in fruits (e.g. oranges) and vegetables; it is also used as a prophylactic treatment for Dutch elm disease. Tiabendazole is also used as a food additive, a preservative with E number E233 (INS number 233). For example, it is applied to bananas to ensure freshness, and is a common ingredient in the waxes applied to the skins of citrus fruits. It is not approved as a food additive in the EU, Australia and New Zealand. Use in treatment of aspergillosis has been reported. It is also used in anti-fungal wallboards as a mixture with azoxystrobin. === Parasiticide === As an antiparasitic, tiabendazole is able to control roundworms (such as those causing strongyloidiasis), hookworms, and other helminth species which infect wild animals, livestock, and humans. First approved for use in sheep in 1961 and horses in 1962, resistance to this drug was first found in Haemonchus contortus in 1964, and then in the two other major small ruminant nematode parasites, Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. === Fungicide === Tiabendazole acts as a fungicide through binding fungal tubulin. Resistant Aspergillus nidulans specimens were found to have a mutation in the gene coding for β-tubulin, which was reversible by a mutation in the gene for α-tubulin. This showed that thiabendazole binds to both α- and β-tubulin. This chemical is also used as a pesticide, including to treat Beech Leaf Disease. === Other === In dogs and cats, tiabendazole is used to treat ear infections. Tiabendazole is also a chelating agent, which means it is used medicinally to bind metals in cases of metal poisoning, such as lead, mercury, or antimony poisoning. == Research == Genes responsible for the maintenance of cell walls in yeast have been shown to be responsible for angiogenesis in vertebrates. Tiabendazole serves to block angiogenesis in both frog embryos and human cells. It has also been shown to serve as a vascular disrupting agent to reduce newly established blood vessels. Tiabendazole has been shown to effectively do this in certain cancer cells. == Pharmacodynamics == Tiabendazole works by inhibition of the mitochondrial, helminth-specific enzyme, fumarate reductase, with possible interaction with endogenous quinone. == Safety == The substance appears to have a slight toxicity in higher doses, with effects such as liver and intestinal disorders at high exposure in test animals (just below LD50 level). Some reproductive disorders and decreasing weaning weight have been observed, also at high exposure. Effects on humans from use as a drug include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, or headache; very rarely also ringing in the ears, vision changes, stomach pain, yellowing eyes and skin, dark urine, fever, fatigue, increased thirst and change in the amount of urine occur. Carcinogenic effects have been shown at higher doses. == Synthesis == Intermediate aryl amidine (2) is prepared by aluminium trichloride-catalyzed addition of aniline to the nitrile of 4-cyanothiazole (1). The amidine (2) is then converted to its N-chloro derivative 3 with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Upon treatment with base, this undergoes a nitrene insertion reaction (4) to produce tiabendazole (5). An alternative synthesis involves reacting 4-thiazolecarboxamide with o-phenylenediamine in polyphosphoric acid. === Derivatives === A number of derivatives of tiabendazole are also pharmaceutical drugs, including albendazole, cambendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole, mebendazole, and flubendazole. == See also == Fungicide use in the United States List of fungicides == References == == External links == Thiabendazole, Extension Toxicology Network Medicinenet: Thiabendazole – Oral	MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL	MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL	{'MED': -0.0016416194, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.2565154, ' FOOD': -7.465036e-06, ' IND': -0.0007844951, 'UST': -1.2664457e-06, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': -1.0280384e-06}
51	Clarithromycin	WIKIPEDIA	"Clarithromycin, sold under the brand name Biaxin among others, is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections. This includes strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, H. pylori infection, and Lyme disease, among others. Clarithromycin can be taken by mouth as a tablet or liquid or can be infused intravenously. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and diarrhea. Severe allergic reactions are rare. Liver problems have been reported. It may cause harm if taken during pregnancy. It is in the macrolide class and works by slowing down bacterial protein synthesis. Clarithromycin resistance is already a major challenge to healthcare systems and such resistance is spreading, leading to recommendations to test the susceptibility of pathogenic organisms to the antibiotic before commencing clarithromycin therapy. Clarithromycin was developed in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Clarithromycin is available as a generic medication. It is made from erythromycin and is chemically known as 6-O-methylerythromycin. == Medical uses == === Antibiotic === Clarithromycin is primarily used to treat a number of bacterial infections including pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, and as an alternative to penicillin in strep throat. Other uses include cat scratch disease and other infections due to Bartonella, cryptosporidiosis, as a second line agent in Lyme disease and toxoplasmosis. It may also be used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in those who cannot take penicillin. It is effective against upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections and helicobacter pylori infections associated with duodenal ulcers. ==== Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility ==== Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria Haemophilus parainfluenzae Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Helicobacter Helicobacter pylori Mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium complex consisting of: Mycobacterium avium avium Mycobacterium intracellulare Other bacteria Chlamydia pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae Safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin in treating clinical infections due to the following bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus (Groups C, F, G) Viridans group streptococci Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria Bordetella pertussis Legionella pneumophila Pasteurella multocida Anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria Clostridium perfringens Peptococcus Niger Cutibacterium acnes Anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus) === Idopathic hypersomnia === Clarithromycin has been researched as a potential treatment for idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) in adults, but the evidence is limited. A 2021 Cochrane study determined that the evidence is inadequate to definitively determine the efficacy of clarithromycin in the management of idiopathic hypersomnia. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2021 clinical practice guidelines conditionally suggested its use, especially for those who don't respond to other therapies. == Contraindications == Clarithromycin should not be taken by people who are allergic to other macrolides or inactive ingredients in the tablets, including microcrystalline cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, magnesium stearate, and povidone Clarithromycin should not be used by people with a history of cholestatic jaundice and/or liver dysfunction associated with prior clarithromycin use. Clarithromycin should not be used in the setting of hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) Use of clarithromycin with the following medications: cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, ergotamine, ticagrelor, ranolazine or dihydroergotamine is not recommended. It should not be used with colchicine in people with kidney or liver impairment. Concomitant use with cholesterol medications such as lovastatin or simvastatin. Hypersensitivity to clarithromycin or any component of the product, erythromycin, or any macrolide antibiotics. QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. == Side effects == The most common side effects are gastrointestinal: diarrhea (3%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting (6%). It also can cause headaches, insomnia, and abnormal liver function tests. Allergic reactions include rashes and anaphylaxis. Less common side effects (<1%) include extreme irritability, hallucinations (auditory and visual), dizziness/motion sickness, and alteration in senses of smell and taste, including a metallic taste. Dry mouth, panic attacks, and nightmares have also been reported, albeit less frequently. === Cardiac === In February 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety communication warning with respect to an increased risk for heart problems or death with the use of clarithromycin, and has recommended that alternative antibiotics be considered in those with heart disease. Clarithromycin can lead to a prolonged QT interval. In patients with long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, or patients taking other QT-prolonging medications, this can increase risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. In one trial, the use of short-term clarithromycin treatment was correlated with an increased incidence of deaths classified as sudden cardiac deaths in stable coronary heart disease patients not using statins. === Liver and kidney === Clarithromycin has been known to cause jaundice, cirrhosis, and kidney problems, including kidney failure. Some case reports suspect it of causing liver disease. === Central nervous system === Common adverse effects of clarithromycin in the central nervous system include dizziness, headaches. Rarely, it can cause ototoxicity, delirium and mania. === Infection === A risk of oral candidiasis and vaginal candidiasis, due to the elimination of the yeast's natural bacterial competitors by the antibiotic, has also been noted. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Clarithromycin should not be used in pregnant women except in situations where no alternative therapy is appropriate. Clarithromycin can cause potential hazard to the fetus hence should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. For lactating mothers it is not known whether clarithromycin is excreted in human milk. == Interactions == Clarithromycin inhibits a liver enzyme, CYP3A4, involved in the metabolism of many other commonly prescribed drugs. Taking clarithromycin with other medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4 may lead to unexpected increases or decreases in drug levels. A few of the common interactions are listed below. === Colchicine === Clarithromycin has been observed to have a dangerous interaction with colchicine as the result of inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolism and P-glycoprotein transport. Combining these two drugs may lead to fatal colchicine toxicity, particularly in people with chronic kidney disease. === Statins === Taking clarithromycin concurrently with certain statins (a class of drugs used to reduce blood serum cholesterol levels) increases the risk of side effects, such as muscle aches and muscle break down (rhabdomyolysis). === Calcium channel blockers === Concurrent therapy with calcium channel blocker may increase risk of low blood pressure, kidney failure, and death, compared to pairing calcium channel blockers with azithromycin, a drug similar to clarithromycin but without CYP3A4 inhibition. Administration of clarithromycin in combination with verapamil have been observed to cause low blood pressure, low heart rate, and lactic acidosis. === Carbamazepine === Clarithromycin may double the level of carbamazepine in the body by reducing its clearance, which may lead to toxic symptoms of carbamazepine, such as double vision, loss of voluntary body movement, and nausea, as well as hyponatremia. === HIV medications === Depending on the combination of medications, clarithromycin therapy could be contraindicated, require changing doses of some medications, or be acceptable without dose adjustments. For example, clarithromycin may lead to decreased zidovudine concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Clarithromycin prevents bacteria from multiplying by acting as a protein synthesis inhibitor. It binds to 23S rRNA, a component of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting the translation of peptides. In addition to its antibiotic activity, clarithromycin has been found to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. In relation to this action, it may have wakefulness-promoting effects in people with hypersomnia. === Pharmacokinetics === Unlike erythromycin, clarithromycin is acid-stable, so can be taken orally without having to be protected from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, clarithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of clarithromycin are released; its concentration in the tissues can be over 10 times higher than in plasma. Highest concentrations are found in liver, lung tissue, and stool. ==== Metabolism ==== Clarithromycin has a fairly rapid first-pass metabolism in the liver. Its major metabolites include an inactive metabolite, N-desmethylclarithromycin, and an active metabolite, 14-(R)-hydroxyclarithromycin. Compared to clarithromycin, 14-(R)-hydroxyclarithromycin is less potent against mycobacterial tuberculosis and the Mycobacterium avium complex. Clarithromycin (20%-40%) and its active metabolite (10%-15%) are excreted in urine. Of all the drugs in its class, clarithromycin has the best bioavailability at 50%, which makes it amenable to oral administration. Its elimination half-life is about 3 to 4 hours with 250 mg administered every 12 h, but increased to 5 to 7 h with 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 h. With any of these dosing regimens, the steady-state concentration of this metabolite is generally attained within 3 to 4 days. == History == Clarithromycin was invented by researchers at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in 1980. The product emerged through efforts to develop a version of the antibiotic erythromycin that did not experience acid instability in the digestive tract, causing side effects, such as nausea and stomachache. Taisho filed for patent protection for the drug around 1980 and subsequently introduced a branded version of its drug, called Clarith, to the Japanese market in 1991. In 1985, Taisho partnered with the American company Abbott Laboratories for the international rights, and Abbott also gained FDA approval for Biaxin in October 1991. The drug went generic in Europe in 2004 and in the US in mid-2005. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Clarithromycin is available as a generic medication. In the United States, clarithromycin is available as immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, and granules for oral suspension. === Brand names === Clarithromycin is available under several brand names in many different countries, including Biaxin, Crixan, Claritron, Clarihexal, Clacid, Claritt, Clacee, Clarac, Clariwin, Claripen, Clarem, Claridar, Cloff, Fromilid, Infex, Kalixocin, Karicin, Klaricid, Klaridex, Klacid, Klaram, Klabax, Klerimed, MegaKlar, Monoclar, Resclar, Rithmo, Truclar, Vikrol and Zeclar. === Manufacturers === In the UK the drug product is manufactured in generic form by a number of manufacturers including Somex Pharma, Ranbaxy, Aptil and Sandoz. == Research == === Hypersomnolence === Clarithromycin has been studied in a phase 2 clinical trial in the treatment of central hypersomnolence (i.e., idiopathic hypersomnolence and narcolepsy without cataplexy). There was no apparent improvement on an objective measure of vigilance, but subjective sleepiness was reduced with the drug compared to placebo. It is thought to work for this use as a GABAA receptor negative allosteric modulator. == References == == External links == US patent 4331803, Watanabe Y, Morimoto S, Omura S, ""Novel erythromycin compounds"", issued 1981-05-19, assigned to Taisho Pharmaceutical"	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
52	Levocetirizine	WIKIPEDIA	Levocetirizine, sold under the brand name Xyzal, among others, is a second-generation antihistamine used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and long-term hives of unclear cause. It is less sedating than older antihistamines. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied and use when breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is classified as a second-generation antihistamine and works by blocking histamine H1-receptors. Levocetirizine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007, and is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 152nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Levocetirizine is used for allergic rhinitis. This includes allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, hives, and itching. == Side effects == Levocetirizine is referred to as a non-sedating antihistamine as it does not enter the brain in significant amounts and is therefore unlikely to cause drowsiness. Cardiac safety with repolarization may be better than some other antihistamines, as levocetirizine does not significantly prolong the QT interval in healthy individuals. However, some people may still experience some slight sleepiness, headache, mouth dryness, lightheadedness, vision problems (mainly blurred vision), palpitations and fatigue. == Pharmacology == Levocetirizine is an antihistamine. It acts as an inverse agonist that decreases activity at histamine H1 receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increases the blood supply to the area, providing relief from the typical symptoms of hay fever. Levocetirizine, (R)-(-)-cetirizine, is essentially a chiral switch of (±)-cetirizine. This enantiomer, the eutomer, is more selective and the (S)-counterpart, the distomer, is inactive. == Chemistry == Chemically, levocetirizine is the active levorotary enantiomer of cetirizine, also called the l-enantiomer of cetirizine. It is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine group of antihistamines. == History == Levocetirizine was first launched in 2001 by the Belgian pharmaceutical company UCB (Union Chimique Belge). == Society and culture == === Availability === In January 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved an over-the-counter preparation. Levocetirizine had previously received authorization by the FDA as a prescription drug in 2007, having already been brought to market throughout much of Europe. In India, a prescription-only drug containing levocetirizine hydrochloride and montelukast is sold as Crohist MK. === Brand names === Preparations of levocetirizine are sold under the following brand names: Xyzal in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland (also Rinozal), Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, The Philippines, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland and UK.

54	Flubendazole	WIKIPEDIA	Flubendazole is an anthelmintic, used both in humans and for veterinarian purposes. It is very close chemically to mebendazole, the only difference being an added fluorine group. == Human use == It is available for human use to treat worm infections. In certain countries such as France, it is inexpensive and available OTC (without prescription) under the brand name Fluvermal as an alternative to mebendazole which is not currently sold there. == Veterinarian use == Under veterinary use, its brand name is Flutelmium which is a paste manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. used by veterinarians for protection against internal parasites and worms in dogs and cats. Other brand names are Flubenol, Biovermin, and Flumoxal. Since 2000, Flubendazole-treated grit has increasingly been laid out on a landscape-scale across many UK grouse-shooting moors by gamekeepers in an attempt to reduce the impact on bird numbers from strongyle worm. Evidence of high worm burden is required before a veterinarian can dispense and sell the product, known as 'medicated grit'. However, there has been increasing concern about contaminants entering the ground waters running off from moorlands, as well as from its use in farming environments and its presence in manure. Researchers are starting to gather research evidence in order to inform policy development on the presence of this and other veterinary medicines in the wider environment. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
56	Benzododecinium	WIKIPEDIA	Benzododecinium bromide (systematic name dimethyldodecylbenzylammonium bromide) is a quaternary ammonium compound used as antiseptic and disinfectant (phenol coefficient is 20-30). It is highly soluble in water and has properties of cationic surfactant. Benzododecinium bromide is effective against gram-positive microbes. In lower concentrations, its activity against conditionally gram-negative microorganisms (such as Proteus, Pseudomonas, Clostridium tetani etc.) is uncertain. It is not effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and bacterial spores. Longer expositions may inactivate some viruses. Benzododecinium bromide is an active ingredient in the trademarked antiseptic product Ajatin produced in the Czech Republic. In place of bromide, the benzododecinium cation may be used with chloride or another anion. == See also == Carbethopendecinium bromide Benzalkonium chloride == References ==	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	{'MED': -0.0013458272, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.024668222, ' PERSON': -0.013842008, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}
59	Tiliroside	PUBMED	 Macrophages polarized to different phenotypes critically contribute to colitis development by coordinating inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes. Herein, targeting the balance between the pro-inflammatory M1 and the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotypes can be a novel therapeutic approach for colitis. In the present study, we firstly demonstrated that tiliroside possessed the ability to alleviate the clinical symptoms of colitis as evidenced by decreased disease activity index (DAI) scores, longer colon length, reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and improvement of colonic pathological damage  Combination therapy with other antineoplastic agent is a favorable approach for targeting the molecules involved in sorafenib resistance. In the present study, we determined whether tiliroside, a natural flavonoid glycoside isolated from oriental paperbush flower, could improve the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to sorafenib. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanisms and identified the potential drug targets of tiliroside. Synergy was performed using CalcuSyn. Transcriptomic studies were adopted to investigate whether tiliroside could induce ferroptosis and inhibit the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in HCC cells. Ferroptosis was analyzed using western blotting, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and Nrf2 knockdown or overexpression were performed to confirm the involvement of Nrf2 in tiliroside-induced ferroptosis. Additionally, molecular docking and biolayer interferometry-based measurements were used to confirm the direct target of tiliroside. Finally, subcutaneous xenograft and orthotopic xenograft tumors in nude mice were used to assess the effects of tiliroside in vivo. Tiliroside significantly enhanced the anti-HCC activity of sorafenib without any discernible side effects. Moreover, the combination of tiliroside and sorafenib induced synergistic effects against HCC in vitro. The inhibitory effects of tiliroside on HCC were antagonized by N-acetylcysteine and the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1. Studies on the mechanism of action revealed that tiliroside could directly bind to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibit its enzymatic activity. Inhibition of TBK1 by tiliroside decreased the phosphorylation of serine 349 on sequestosome-1 (p62) and the affinity of p62 for kelch like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and promoted Keap1-mediated Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation. The downstream target proteins of Nrf2, including glutathione peroxidase 4, ferritin heavy chain 1, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, demonstrated similar results to that of Nrf2 protein, inducing ferroptosis in tiliroside-treated HCC cells. We extended these findings in vivo and found that tiliroside inhibited the growth of HepG2 tumors in both subcutaneous xenograft and orthotopic xenograft tumor models of HCC. Our findings imply that tiliroside is a potent TBK1 inhibitor and a candidate natural anti-cancer product that could function as a sensitizer of sorafenib in HCC treatment by targeting TBK1 to induce ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent process that regulates cell death. Emerging evidences suggest that ferroptosis induces acute kidney injury (AKI) progression, and inhibiting ferroptosis provides an effect strategy for AKI treatment. The disruption of the NRF2-KEAP1 protein to protein interaction (PPI) induces NRF2 activation, which provides a promising strategy that can identify new ferroptosis inhibitors. A previous study revealed that tiliroside, a glycosidic flavonoid extracted from Edgeworthia chrysantha Lindl (buds), has anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects via NRF2 activation. However, the mechanism through which tiliroside activates NRF2 is unknown, and it remains unclear whether it has protective effects against AKI. To investigate whether tiliroside has protective effects against AKI in mice and the associated mechanisms. Possible tiliroside substrates were analyzed using molecular docking. Cisplatin- and ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced AKI mouse models and HK2 cells model were constructed to evaluate the protective effects of tiliroside. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated NRF2 knockout HK2 cells were used to verify whether NRF2 mediates tiliroside protective effects. In vivo, our results showed that tiliroside treatment preserved kidney functions in AKI mice models, as showed by lower levels of serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and renal injury markers, including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM1), compared with the mice in control groups. In vitro, tiliroside treatment greatly ameliorated cisplatin-induced ferroptosis through NRF2 activation in cultured HK2 cells, as evidenced by the protective effects of tiliroside being greatly blunted after the knockout of NRF2 in HK2 cells. Mechanistic studies indicated that tiliroside promoted NRF2/GPX4 pathway activation and ferroptosis inhibition, perhaps via the disruption of the NRF2-KEAP1 PPI. Together, our results demonstrate that tiliroside may serve as a NRF2-KEAP1 PPI inhibitor and prevents ferroptosis-induced AKI, indicating its potential for clinical AKI treatment.

64	Linarin	PUBMED	 Due to various factors, there is still a lack of effective neuroprotective agents for ischemic stroke in clinical practice. Neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress are some of the important pathological mechanisms in ischemic stroke. Linarin has been reported to have anti-inflammation, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects in myocardial ischemia, osteoarthritis, and kidney disease. Whether it exerts neuroprotective functions in ischemic stroke has not been investigated. The results showed that linarin could reduce the infarct volume in cerebral ischemia animal models, improve the neurological function scores and suppress the expression of inflammatory factors mediating the NF-κB. Meanwhile, it could protect the neurons from OGD/R-induced-apoptosis, which was related to the PERK-eIF2α pathway. Our results suggested linarin could inhibit neuronal inflammation and apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of linarin may be related to the inhibition of AKR1B1. Our study offers new insight into protecting against ischemia-reperfusion injury by linarin treatment in stroke. Linarin has been implicated in the inhibition of inflammatory responses and hepatoprotective effects. However, the precise mechanism by which Linarin integrates injury-induced signaling from inflammatory responses and oxidative stress remains unclear. We evaluated the role of Linarin in a mouse model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl Our results revealed Linarin remarkably attenuated the loss of hepatic architecture, inflammatory cell infiltration, serum transaminases, and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by CCl Linarin prevents acute liver injury, possibly by alleviating ROS-induced oxidative stress, inhibiting TLR4/MyD88 and JNK/p38/ERK-mediated inflammatory responses, and promoting Beclin 1/LC3II-mediated autophagic flux.

69	Harman	PUBMED	 The aromatic beta-carbolines norharman and harman have been implicated in a number of human diseases including Parkinson's disease, tremor, addiction and cancer. It has been shown that these compounds are normal body constituents formed endogenously but external sources have been identified. Here, we summarise literature data on levels of norharman and harman in fried meat and fish, meat extracts, alcoholic drinks, and coffee brews. Other sources include edible and medicinal plants but tobacco smoke has been identified as a major source. Exposure levels from these different dietary sources are estimated to a maximum of 4 microg norharman per kg body weight (bw) per day and 1 microg harman per kg bw per day. Exposure via tobacco smoke depends on smoking habits and type of cigarettes but can be estimated to 1.1 microg/kg bw for norharman and 0.6 microg/kg bw for harman per package of cigarettes smoked. Studies on toxicokinetics indicate that inhalative exposure leads to a rapid increase in plasma levels and high bioavailability of norharman and harman. Oral bioavailability is lower but there are indications that sublingual absorption may increase dietary uptake of beta-carbolines. Endogenous formation can be estimated to be 50-100 ng/kg bw per day for norharman and about 20 ng/kg bw per day for harman but these rates may increase with high intake of precursors. Biomarker studies on plasma levels of beta-carbolines reported on elevated levels of norharman, harman or both in diseased patients, alcoholics and following tobacco smoking or consumption of beta-carboline-containing food. Cigarette smoking has been identified as major influence but dietary exposure may contribute to exposure.

74	Fenbendazole	WIKIPEDIA	Fenbendazole is a broad spectrum benzimidazole anthelmintic used against gastrointestinal parasites including: giardia, roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, the tapeworm genus Taenia (but not effective against Dipylidium caninum, a common dog tapeworm), pinworms, aelurostrongylus, paragonimiasis, strongyles, and strongyloides that can be administered to sheep, cattle, horses, fish, dogs, cats, rabbits, most reptiles, freshwater shrimp tanks as planaria and hydra treatments, as well as seals. == Mechanism of action == Fenbendazole works by binding to tubulin, a protein that is part of the microtubules in the cells of parasites. This binding disrupts the microtubules' formation and function, leading to the parasites' inability to absorb nutrients, resulting in their eventual death. This mode of action makes fenbendazole effective against both adult and larval stages of many parasitic worms. == Uses in veterinary medicine == === Dogs and cats === Fenbendazole is commonly used to treat intestinal parasites, including roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, and certain tapeworms. It is often administered as part of a broader deworming protocol. === Horses === In equine medicine, fenbendazole is used to control strongyles, pinworms, and ascarids. It is available in paste form for easy administration. === Cattle and goats === Fenbendazole is effective against lungworms, stomach worms, and intestinal worms in ruminants. It is administered through feed, drenching, or bolus form. == Drug interactions == Drug interactions may occur if salicylanilides such as dibromsalan and niclosamide are co-administered. Abortions in cattle and death in sheep have been reported after using these medications together. Abortions in domestic ruminants have been associated with concurrent use of anti-trematode therapeutic agents. == Dosage and administration == The appropriate dosage of the medication fenbendazole depends on the specific animal species being treated as well as the particular formulation or preparation of the fenbendazole product being used. To ensure the correct dosage considering the animal species being treated with its weight, using a dosage calculator like the Fenbendazole Paraclear Defense Dosage Calculator would be recommended. == Toxicity == Fenbendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in most species. The LD50 in laboratory animals exceeds 10 g/kg when administered orally. == Metabolism == Fenbendazole is metabolized in the liver to oxfendazole, which is anthelmintic too; oxfendazole partially gets reduced back to fenbendazole in the liver and rumen. Also, fenbendazole itself is an active metabolite of another anthelmintic drug, febantel. == Safety and precautions == Fenbendazole is generally safe when used as directed. However, it is important to follow veterinary guidelines and dosage instructions to avoid potential side effects. Some animals may experience mild gastrointestinal upset. It is not recommended for use in pregnant animals without veterinary advice. == See also == Ivermectin – Medication for parasite infestations Nocodazole – Microtubule depolymerizing drug Praziquantel – Anti-parasite medication == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -3.1281633e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
78	Tyrosine	WIKIPEDIA	"L-Tyrosine or tyrosine (symbol Tyr or Y) or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine is one of the 20 standard amino acids that are used by cells to synthesize proteins. It is a conditionally essential amino acid with a polar side group. The word ""tyrosine"" is from the Greek tyrós, meaning cheese, as it was first discovered in 1846 by German chemist Justus von Liebig in the protein casein from cheese. It is called tyrosyl when referred to as a functional group or side chain. While tyrosine is generally classified as a hydrophobic amino acid, it is more hydrophilic than phenylalanine. It is encoded by the codons UAC and UAU in messenger RNA. The one-letter symbol Y was assigned to tyrosine for being alphabetically nearest of those letters available. Note that T was assigned to the structurally simpler threonine, U was avoided for its similarity with V for valine, W was assigned to tryptophan, while X was reserved for undetermined or atypical amino acids. The mnemonic tYrosine was also proposed. == Functions == Aside from being a proteinogenic amino acid, tyrosine has a special role by virtue of the phenol functionality. Its hydroxy group is able to form the ester linkage, with phosphate in particular. Phosphate groups are transferred to tyrosine residues by way of protein kinases. This is one of the post-translational modifications. Phosphorylated tyrosine occurs in proteins that are part of signal transduction processes. Similar functionality is also presented in serine and threonine, whose side chains have a hydroxy group, but are alcohols. Phosphorylation of these three amino acids' moieties (including tyrosine) creates a negative charge on their ends, that is greater than the negative charge of the only negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acids. Phosphorylated proteins keep these same properties—which are useful for more reliable protein-protein interactions—by means of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Binding sites for a signalling phosphoprotein may be diverse in their chemical structure. Phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group can change the activity of the target protein, or may form part of a signaling cascade via SH2 domain binding. A tyrosine residue also plays an important role in photosynthesis. In chloroplasts (photosystem II), it acts as an electron donor in the reduction of oxidized chlorophyll. In this process, it loses the hydrogen atom of its phenolic OH-group. This radical is subsequently reduced in the photosystem II by the four core manganese clusters. == Dietary requirements and sources == The Dietary Reference Intake for tyrosine is usually estimated together with phenylalanine. It varies depending on an estimate method, however the ideal proportion of these two amino acids is considered to be 60:40 (phenylalanine:tyrosine) as a human body has such composition. Tyrosine, which can also be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine, is found in many high-protein food products such as meat, fish, cheese, cottage cheese, milk, yogurt, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soy protein and lima beans. For example, the white of an egg has about 250 mg per egg, while beef, lamb, pork, tuna, salmon, chicken, and turkey contain about 500–1000 mg per 3 ounces (85 g) portion. == Biosynthesis == In plants and most microorganisms, tyrosine is produced via prephenate, an intermediate on the shikimate pathway. Prephenate is oxidatively decarboxylated with retention of the hydroxyl group to give p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is transaminated using glutamate as the nitrogen source to give tyrosine and α-ketoglutarate. Mammals synthesize tyrosine from the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), which is derived from food. The conversion of Phe to Tyr is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of phenylalanine, such that it becomes tyrosine. == Metabolism == === Phosphorylation and sulfation === Some of the tyrosine residues can be tagged (at the hydroxyl group) with a phosphate group (phosphorylated) by protein kinases. In its phosphorylated form, tyrosine is called phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the key steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity. Phosphotyrosine can be detected through specific antibodies. Tyrosine residues may also be modified by the addition of a sulfate group, a process known as tyrosine sulfation. Tyrosine sulfation is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST). Like the phosphotyrosine antibodies mentioned above, antibodies have recently been described that specifically detect sulfotyrosine. === Precursor to neurotransmitters and hormones === In dopaminergic cells in the brain, tyrosine is converted to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine can then be converted into other catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in the colloid of the thyroid are also derived from tyrosine. === Precursor to other compounds === The latex of Papaver somniferum, the opium poppy, has been shown to convert tyrosine into the alkaloid morphine and the bio-synthetic pathway has been established from tyrosine to morphine by using Carbon-14 radio-labelled tyrosine to trace the in-vivo synthetic route.Tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) is an enzyme in the natural phenols biosynthesis pathway. It transforms L-tyrosine into p-coumaric acid. Tyrosine is also the precursor to the pigment melanin. Tyrosine (or its precursor phenylalanine) is needed to synthesize the benzoquinone structure which forms part of coenzyme Q10. === Degradation === The decomposition of L-tyrosine (syn. para-hydroxyphenylalanine) begins with an α-ketoglutarate dependent transamination through the tyrosine transaminase to para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The positional description para, abbreviated p, mean that the hydroxyl group and side chain on the phenyl ring are across from each other (see the illustration below). The next oxidation step catalyzes by p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and splitting off CO2 homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-1-acetate). In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase is required. Thereby, through the incorporation of a further O2 molecule, maleylacetoacetate is created. Fumarylacetoacetate is created by maleylacetoacetate cis-trans-isomerase through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation. This cis-trans-isomerase contains glutathione as a coenzyme. Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split by the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase through the addition of a water molecule. Thereby fumarate (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and acetoacetate (3-ketobutyroate) are liberated. Acetoacetate is a ketone body, which is activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter it can be converted into acetyl-CoA, which in turn can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle or be used for fatty acid synthesis. Phloretic acid is also a urinary metabolite of tyrosine in rats. == Ortho- and meta-tyrosine == Three structural isomers of L-tyrosine are known. In addition to the common amino acid L-tyrosine, which is the para isomer (para-tyr, p-tyr or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine), there are two additional regioisomers, namely meta-tyrosine (also known as 3-hydroxyphenylalanine, L-m-tyrosine, and m-tyr) and ortho-tyrosine (o-tyr or 2-hydroxyphenylalanine), that occur in nature. The m-tyr and o-tyr isomers, which are rare, arise through non-enzymatic free-radical hydroxylation of phenylalanine under conditions of oxidative stress. == Medical use == Tyrosine is a precursor to neurotransmitters and increases plasma neurotransmitter levels (particularly dopamine and norepinephrine), but has little if any effect on mood in normal subjects. A 2015 systematic review found that ""tyrosine loading acutely counteracts decrements in working memory and information processing that are induced by demanding situational conditions such as extreme weather or cognitive load"" and therefore ""tyrosine may benefit healthy individuals exposed to demanding situational conditions"". == Industrial synthesis == L-tyrosine is used in pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and food additives. Two methods were formerly used to manufacture L-tyrosine. The first involves the extraction of the desired amino acid from protein hydrolysates using a chemical approach. The second utilizes enzymatic synthesis from phenolics, pyruvate, and ammonia through the use of tyrosine phenol-lyase. Advances in genetic engineering and the advent of industrial fermentation have shifted the synthesis of L-tyrosine to the use of engineered strains of E. coli. == See also == Albinism Alkaptonuria Betalain Iodinated tyrosine derivatives Pauly reaction Tyramine Tyrosine sulfation Tyrosinemia == References == == External links == Tyrosine MS Spectrum Tyrosine metabolism Archived 2019-07-26 at the Wayback Machine Phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis Archived 2021-05-06 at the Wayback Machine"	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.0005295606, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -0.00040421702, ' FOOD': -0.004227509, ' MED': -0.0021723858, 'ICAL': -4.246537e-06}
82	Nicotine	WIKIPEDIA	"Nicotine is a naturally produced alkaloid in the nightshade family of plants (most predominantly in tobacco and Duboisia hopwoodii) and is widely used recreationally as a stimulant and anxiolytic. As a pharmaceutical drug, it is used for smoking cessation to relieve withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine acts as a receptor agonist at most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), except at two nicotinic receptor subunits (nAChRα9 and nAChRα10) where it acts as a receptor antagonist. Nicotine constitutes approximately 0.6–3.0% of the dry weight of tobacco. Nicotine is also present at ppb concentrations in edible plants in the family Solanaceae, including potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants, though sources disagree on whether this has any biological significance to human consumers. It functions as an antiherbivore toxin; consequently, nicotine was widely used as an insecticide in the past, and neonicotinoids (structurally similar to nicotine), such as imidacloprid, are some of the most effective and widely used insecticides. Nicotine is highly addictive. Slow-release forms (gums and patches, when used correctly) can be less addictive and help in quitting. Animal research suggests that monoamine oxidase inhibitors present in tobacco smoke may enhance nicotine's addictive properties. An average cigarette yields about 2 mg of absorbed nicotine. The estimated lower dose limit for fatal outcomes is 500–1,000 mg of ingested nicotine for an adult (6.5–13 mg/kg). Nicotine addiction involves drug-reinforced behavior, compulsive use, and relapse following abstinence. Nicotine dependence involves tolerance, sensitization, physical dependence, psychological dependence, and can cause distress. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include depressed mood, stress, anxiety, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances. Mild nicotine withdrawal symptoms are measurable in unrestricted smokers, who experience normal moods only as their blood nicotine levels peak, with each cigarette. On quitting, withdrawal symptoms worsen sharply, then gradually improve to a normal state. Nicotine use as a tool for quitting smoking has a good safety history. Animal studies suggest that nicotine may adversely affect cognitive development in adolescence, but the relevance of these findings to human brain development is disputed. At low amounts, it has a mild analgesic effect. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, ""nicotine is not generally considered to be a carcinogen"". The Surgeon General of the United States indicates that evidence is inadequate to infer the presence or absence of a causal relationship between exposure to nicotine and risk for cancer. Nicotine has been shown to produce birth defects in humans and is considered a teratogen. The median lethal dose of nicotine in humans is unknown. High doses are known to cause nicotine poisoning, organ failure, and death through paralysis of respiratory muscles, though serious or fatal overdoses are rare. == Uses == === Medical === The primary therapeutic use of nicotine is treating nicotine dependence to eliminate smoking and the damage it does to health. Controlled levels of nicotine are given to patients through gums, dermal patches, lozenges, inhalers, or nasal sprays to wean them off their dependence. A 2018 Cochrane Collaboration review found high-quality evidence that all current forms of nicotine replacement therapy (gum, patch, lozenges, inhaler, and nasal spray) increase the chances of successfully quitting smoking by 50–60%, regardless of setting. Combining nicotine patch use with a faster acting nicotine replacement, like gum or spray, improves the odds of treatment success. In contrast to recreational nicotine products, which have been designed to maximize the likelihood of addiction, nicotine replacement products (NRTs) are designed to minimize addictiveness.: 112 The more quickly a dose of nicotine is delivered and absorbed, the higher the addiction risk. Investigative Nicotine is being researched in clinical trials for possible benefit in treating Parkinson's disease, dementia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and depression. Nicotine may partly attenuate sensory gating and attentional deficits associated with schizophrenia. Short-term use of transdermal nicotine was found to improve subjects’ reaction time and alertness in given tasks. Nicotine was not found to improve negative, positive, or other cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. === Pesticide === Nicotine has been used as an insecticide since at least 1690, in the form of tobacco extracts or as pure nicotine sulphate (although other components of tobacco also seem to have pesticide effects). It acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and gave the receptor its name. Nicotine is in IRAC group 4B. Nicotine insecticides have been banned in the US since 2014, including use on organic crops, and caution is recommended for small gardeners. Nicotine pesticides have been banned in the EU since 2009. Foods are imported from countries in which nicotine pesticides are allowed, such as China, but foods may not exceed maximum nicotine levels. Neonicotinoids, such as imidacloprid, which are derived from and structurally similar to nicotine, are widely used as agricultural and veterinary pesticides as of 2016. === Performance === Nicotine-containing products are sometimes used for the performance-enhancing effects of nicotine on cognition. A 2010 meta-analysis of 41 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies concluded that nicotine or smoking had significant positive effects on aspects of fine motor abilities, alerting and orienting attention, and episodic and working memory. A 2015 review noted that stimulation of the α4β2 nicotinic receptor is responsible for certain improvements in attentional performance; among the nicotinic receptor subtypes, nicotine has the highest binding affinity at the α4β2 receptor (ki=1 nM), which is also the biological target that mediates nicotine's addictive properties. Nicotine has potential beneficial effects, but it also has paradoxical effects, which may be due to the inverted U-shape of the dose-response curve or pharmacokinetic features. === Recreational === Nicotine is used as a recreational drug. It is widely used, highly addictive and hard to discontinue. Nicotine is often used compulsively, and dependence can develop within days. Recreational drug users commonly use nicotine for its mood-altering effects. Recreational nicotine products include chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, snuff, pipe tobacco, snus, and nicotine pouches. Alcohol infused with nicotine is called nicotini. == Contraindications == Nicotine use for tobacco cessation has few contraindications. It is not known whether nicotine replacement therapy is effective for smoking cessation in adolescents, as of 2014. It is therefore not recommended to adolescents. It is not safe to use nicotine during pregnancy or breastfeeding, although it is safer than smoking. The desirability of NRT use in pregnancy is therefore debated. Randomized trials and observational studies of nicotine replacement therapy in cardiovascular patients show no increase in adverse cardiovascular events compared to those treated with placebo. Using nicotine products during cancer treatment may be contraindicated, as nicotine may promote tumour growth, but temporary use of NRTs to quit smoking may be advised for harm reduction. Nicotine gum is contraindicated in individuals with temporomandibular joint disease. People with chronic nasal disorders and severe reactive airway disease require additional precautions when using nicotine nasal sprays. Nicotine in any form is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to nicotine. == Adverse effects == Nicotine is classified as a poison, and it is ""extremely hazardous"". However, at doses typically used by consumers, it presents little if any hazard to the user. A 2018 Cochrane Collaboration review lists nine main adverse events related to nicotine replacement therapy: headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms, insomnia, abnormal dreams, non-ischemic palpitations and chest pain, skin reactions, oral/nasal reactions, and hiccups. Many of these were also common in the placebo group without nicotine. Palpitations and chest pain were deemed ""rare"" and there was no evidence of an increased number of serious cardiac problems compared to the placebo group, even in people with established cardiac disease. The common side effects from nicotine exposure are listed in the table below. Serious adverse events due to the use of nicotine replacement therapy are extremely rare. At low amounts, it has a mild analgesic effect. However, at sufficiently high doses, nicotine may result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, bradycardia, and possibly seizures, hypoventilation, and death. === Sleep === Nicotine reduces the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and total sleep time in healthy nonsmokers given nicotine via a transdermal patch, and the reduction is dose-dependent. Acute nicotine intoxication has been found to significantly reduce total sleep time and increase REM latency, sleep onset latency, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 sleep time. Depressive non-smokers experience mood and sleep improvements under nicotine administration; however, subsequent nicotine withdrawal has a negative effect on both mood and sleep. === Cardiovascular system === Nicotine exerts several significant effects on the cardiovascular system. Primarily, it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to the release of catecholamines. This activation results in an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as enhanced myocardial contractility, which raises the workload on the heart. Additionally, nicotine causes systemic vasoconstriction, including constriction of coronary arteries, which can reduce blood flow to the heart. Long-term exposure to nicotine may impair endothelial function, potentially contributing to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, nicotine has been associated with the development of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in individuals who already have underlying heart disease. The effects of nicotine can be differentiated between short-term and long-term use. Short-term nicotine use, such as that associated with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation, appears to pose little cardiovascular risk, even for patients with known cardiovascular conditions. In contrast, longer-term nicotine use may not accelerate atherosclerosis but could contribute to acute cardiovascular events in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Many severe cardiovascular effects traditionally associated with smoking may not be solely attributable to nicotine itself. Cigarette smoke contains numerous other potentially cardiotoxic substances, including carbon monoxide and oxidant gases. A 2016 review of the cardiovascular toxicity of nicotine concluded, ""Based on current knowledge, we believe that the cardiovascular risks of nicotine from e-cigarette use in people without cardiovascular disease are quite low. We have concerns that nicotine from e-cigarettes could pose some risk for users with cardiovascular disease."" A 2018 Cochrane review found that, in rare cases, nicotine replacement therapy can cause non-ischemic chest pain (i.e., chest pain that is unrelated to a heart attack) and heart palpitations, but does not increase the incidence of serious cardiac adverse events (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac death) relative to controls. ==== Blood pressure ==== In the short term, nicotine causes a transient increase in blood pressure. Long term, epidemiological studies generally show increased blood pressure and hypertension among nicotine users. === Reinforcement disorders === Nicotine is highly addictive but paradoxically has quite weak reinforcing property compared to other drugs of abuse in various animals. Its addictiveness depends on how it is administered and also depends upon form in which nicotine is used. Animal research suggests that monoamine oxidase inhibitors, acetaldehyde and other constituents in tobacco smoke may enhance its addictiveness. Nicotine dependence involves aspects of both psychological dependence and physical dependence, since discontinuation of extended use has been shown to produce both affective (e.g., anxiety, irritability, craving, anhedonia) and somatic (mild motor dysfunctions such as tremor) withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms peak in one to three days and can persist for several weeks. Even though other drugs of dependence can have withdrawal states lasting 6 months or longer, this does not appear to occur with cigarette withdrawal. Normal between-cigarettes discontinuation, in unrestricted smokers, causes mild but measurable nicotine withdrawal symptoms. These include mildly worse mood, stress, anxiety, cognition, and sleep, all of which briefly return to normal with the next cigarette. Smokers have a worse mood than they typically would have if they were not nicotine-dependent; they experience normal moods only immediately after smoking. Nicotine dependence is associated with poor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration among smokers. In dependent smokers, withdrawal causes impairments in memory and attention, and smoking during withdrawal returns these cognitive abilities to pre-withdrawal levels. The temporarily increased cognitive levels of smokers after inhaling smoke are offset by periods of cognitive decline during nicotine withdrawal. Therefore, the overall daily cognitive levels of smokers and non-smokers are roughly similar. Nicotine activates the mesolimbic pathway and induces long-term ΔFosB expression (i.e., produces phosphorylated ΔFosB isoforms) in the nucleus accumbens when inhaled or injected frequently or at high doses, but not necessarily when ingested. Consequently, high daily exposure (possibly excluding oral route) to nicotine can cause ΔFosB overexpression in the nucleus accumbens, resulting in nicotine addiction. === Cancer === Contrary to popular belief, nicotine itself does not cause cancer in humans, although it is unclear whether it functions as a tumor promoter as of 2012. A 2018 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concludes, ""[w]hile it is biologically plausible that nicotine can act as a tumor promoter, the existing body of evidence indicates this is unlikely to translate into increased risk of human cancer."" Although nicotine is classified as a non-carcinogenic substance, it can still promote tumor growth and metastasis. It induces several processes that contribute to cancer progression, including cell cycle progression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and evasion of apoptosis. These effects are primarily mediated through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the α7 subtype, and to a lesser extent, β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs). Activation of these receptors triggers several signaling cascades crucial in cancer biology, notably the MAPK/ERK pathway, PI3K/AKT pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling. Nicotine promotes lung cancer development by enhancing proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) via nAChRs, which are present in lung cancer cells. Additionally, nicotine-induced EMT contributes to drug resistance in cancer cells. Nicotine in tobacco can form carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines through a nitrosation reaction. This occurs mostly in the curing and processing of tobacco. However, nicotine in the mouth and stomach can react to form N-nitrosonornicotine, a known type 1 carcinogen, suggesting that consumption of non-tobacco forms of nicotine may still play a role in carcinogenesis. === Genotoxicity === Nicotine causes DNA damage in several types of human cells as judged by assays for genotoxicity such as the comet assay, cytokinesis-block micronucleus test and chromosome aberrations test. In humans, this damage can happen in primary parotid gland cells, lymphocytes, and respiratory tract cells. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Nicotine has been shown to produce birth defects in some animal species, but not others; consequently, it is considered to be a possible teratogen in humans. In animal studies that resulted in birth defects, researchers found that nicotine negatively affects fetal brain development and pregnancy outcomes; the negative effects on early brain development are associated with abnormalities in brain metabolism and neurotransmitter system function. Nicotine crosses the placenta and is found in the breast milk of mothers who smoke as well as mothers who inhale passive smoke. Nicotine exposure in utero is responsible for several complications of pregnancy and birth: pregnant women who smoke are at greater risk for both miscarriage and stillbirth and infants exposed to nicotine in utero tend to have lower birth weights. A McMaster University research group observed in 2010 that rats exposed to nicotine in the womb (via parenteral infusion) later in life had conditions including type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. == Overdose == It is unlikely that a person would overdose on nicotine through smoking alone. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated in 2013 that there are no significant safety concerns associated with the use of more than one form of over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy at the same time, or using OTC NRT at the same time as another nicotine-containing product, like cigarettes. The median lethal dose of nicotine in humans is unknown. Nevertheless, nicotine has a relatively high toxicity in comparison to many other alkaloids such as caffeine, which has an LD50 of 127 mg/kg when administered to mice. At sufficiently high doses, it is associated with nicotine poisoning, which, while common in children (in whom poisonous and lethal levels occur at lower doses per kilogram of body weight) rarely results in significant morbidity or death. The estimated lower dose limit for fatal outcomes is 500–1,000 mg of ingested nicotine for an adult (6.5–13 mg/kg). The initial symptoms of a nicotine overdose typically include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersalivation, abdominal pain, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), hypertension (high blood pressure), tachypnea (rapid breathing), headache, dizziness, pallor (pale skin), auditory or visual disturbances, and perspiration, followed shortly after by marked bradycardia (slow heart rate), bradypnea (slow breathing), and hypotension (low blood pressure). An increased respiratory rate (i.e., tachypnea) is one of the primary signs of nicotine poisoning. At sufficiently high doses, somnolence (sleepiness or drowsiness), confusion, syncope (loss of consciousness from fainting), shortness of breath, marked weakness, seizures, and coma may occur. Lethal nicotine poisoning rapidly produces seizures, and death – which may occur within minutes – is believed to be due to respiratory paralysis. === Toxicity === Today nicotine is less commonly used in agricultural insecticides, which was a main source of poisoning. More recent cases of poisoning typically appear to be in the form of Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS), accidental ingestion of tobacco or tobacco products, or ingestion of nicotine-containing plants. People who harvest or cultivate tobacco may experience GTS, a type of nicotine poisoning caused by dermal exposure to wet tobacco leaves. This occurs most commonly in young, inexperienced tobacco harvesters who do not consume tobacco. People can be exposed to nicotine in the workplace by breathing it in, skin absorption, swallowing it, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for nicotine exposure in the workplace as 0.5 mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.5 mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At environmental levels of 5 mg/m3, nicotine is immediately dangerous to life and health. == Drug interactions == === Pharmacodynamic === Potential interaction with sympathomimetic drugs (adrenergic agonists) and sympatholytic drugs (alpha-blockers and beta-blockers). === Pharmacokinetic === Nicotine and cigarette smoke both induce the expression of liver enzymes (e.g., certain cytochrome P450 proteins) which metabolize drugs, leading to the potential for alterations in drug metabolism. Smoking cessation may decrease the metabolism of acetaminophen, beta-blockers, caffeine, oxazepam, pentazocine, propoxyphene, theophylline, and tricyclic antidepressants, leading to higher plasma concentrations of these drugs. Possible alteration of nicotine absorption through the skin from the transdermal nicotine patch by drugs that cause vasodilation or vasoconstriction. Possible alteration of nicotine absorption through the nasal cavity from the nicotine nasal spray by nasal vasoconstrictors (e.g., xylometazoline). Possible alteration of nicotine absorption through oral mucosa from nicotine gum and lozenges by food and drink that modify salivary pH. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Nicotine acts as a receptor agonist at most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), except at two nicotinic receptor subunits (nAChRα9 and nAChRα10) where it acts as a receptor antagonist. Such antagonism results in mild analgesia. ==== Central nervous system ==== By binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain, nicotine elicits its psychoactive effects and increases the levels of several neurotransmitters in various brain structures – acting as a sort of ""volume control"". Nicotine has a higher affinity for nicotinic receptors in the brain than those in skeletal muscle, though at toxic doses it can induce contractions and respiratory paralysis. Nicotine's selectivity is thought to be due to a particular amino acid difference on these receptor subtypes. Nicotine is unusual in comparison to most drugs, as its profile changes from stimulant to sedative with increasing dosages, a phenomenon known as ""Nesbitt's paradox"" after the doctor who first described it in 1969. At very high doses it dampens neuronal activity. Nicotine induces both behavioral stimulation and anxiety in animals. Research into nicotine's most predominant metabolite, cotinine, suggests that some of nicotine's psychoactive effects are mediated by cotinine. Nicotine activates nicotinic receptors (particularly α4β2 nicotinic receptors, but also α5 nAChRs) on neurons that innervate the ventral tegmental area and within the mesolimbic pathway where it appears to cause the release of dopamine. This nicotine-induced dopamine release occurs at least partially through activation of the cholinergic–dopaminergic reward link in the ventral tegmental area. Nicotine can modulate the firing rate of the ventral tegmental area neurons. These actions are largely responsible for the strongly reinforcing effects of nicotine, which often occur in the absence of euphoria; however, mild euphoria from nicotine use can occur in some individuals. Chronic nicotine use inhibits class I and II histone deacetylases in the striatum, where this effect plays a role in nicotine addiction. ==== Sympathetic nervous system ==== Nicotine also activates the sympathetic nervous system, acting via splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla, stimulating the release of epinephrine. Acetylcholine released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing the release of epinephrine (and norepinephrine) into the bloodstream. ==== Adrenal medulla ==== By binding to ganglion type nicotinic receptors in the adrenal medulla, nicotine increases flow of adrenaline (epinephrine), a stimulating hormone and neurotransmitter. By binding to the receptors, it causes cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the exocytosis of chromaffin granules and thus the release of epinephrine (and norepinephrine) into the bloodstream. The release of epinephrine (adrenaline) causes an increase in heart rate, blood pressure and respiration, as well as higher blood glucose levels. === Pharmacokinetics === As nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream and crosses the blood–brain barrier reaching the brain within 10–20 seconds after inhalation. The elimination half-life of nicotine in the body is around two hours. Nicotine is primarily excreted in urine and urinary concentrations vary depending upon urine flow rate and urine pH. The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking can depend on many factors, including the types of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. However, it has been found that the nicotine yield of individual products has only a small effect (4.4%) on the blood concentration of nicotine, suggesting ""the assumed health advantage of switching to lower-tar and lower-nicotine cigarettes may be largely offset by the tendency of smokers to compensate by increasing inhalation"". Nicotine has a half-life of 1–2 hours. Cotinine is an active metabolite of nicotine that remains in the blood with a half-life of 18–20 hours, making it easier to analyze. Nicotine is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes (mostly CYP2A6, and also by CYP2B6) and FMO3, which selectively metabolizes (S)-nicotine. A major metabolite is cotinine. Other primary metabolites include nicotine N-oxide, nornicotine, nicotine isomethonium ion, 2-hydroxynicotine and nicotine glucuronide. Under some conditions, other substances may be formed such as myosmine. Glucuronidation and oxidative metabolism of nicotine to cotinine are both inhibited by menthol, an additive to mentholated cigarettes, thus increasing the half-life of nicotine in vivo. === Metabolism === Nicotine decreases hunger and as a consequence food consumption, alongside increasing energy expenditure. The majority of research shows that nicotine reduces body weight, but some researchers have found that nicotine may result in weight gain under specific types of eating habits in animal models. Nicotine effect on weight appears to result from nicotine's stimulation of α3β4 nAChR receptors located in the POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus and subsequently the melanocortin system, especially the melanocortin-4 receptors on second-order neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, thus modulating feeding inhibition. POMC neurons are a precursor of the melanocortin system, a critical regulator of body weight and peripheral tissue such as skin and hair. == Chemistry == Nicotine is a hygroscopic, colorless to yellow-brown, oily liquid, that is readily soluble in alcohol, ether or light petroleum. It is miscible with water in its neutral amine base form between 60 °C and 210 °C. It is a dibasic nitrogenous base, having Kb1=1×10−6, Kb2=1×10−11. It readily forms ammonium salts with acids that are usually solid and water-soluble. Its flash point is 95 °C and its auto-ignition temperature is 244 °C. Nicotine is readily volatile (vapor pressure 5.5 Pa at 25 °C) On exposure to ultraviolet light or various oxidizing agents, nicotine is converted to nicotine oxide, nicotinic acid (niacin, vitamin B3), and methylamine. Nicotine is chiral and hence optically active, having two enantiomeric forms. The naturally occurring form of nicotine is levorotatory with a specific rotation of [α]D=–166.4° ((−)-nicotine). The dextrorotatory form, (+)-nicotine is physiologically less active than (−)-nicotine. (−)-nicotine is more toxic than (+)-nicotine. The salts of (−)-nicotine are usually dextrorotatory; this conversion between levorotatory and dextrorotatory upon protonation is common among alkaloids. The hydrochloride and sulfate salts become optically inactive if heated in a closed vessel above 180 °C. Anabasine is a structural isomer of nicotine, as both compounds have the molecular formula C10H14N2. Nicotine that is found in natural tobacco is primarily (99%) the S-enantiomer. Conversely, the most common chemistry synthetic methods for generating nicotine yields a product that is approximately equal proportions of the S- and R-enantiomers. This suggests that tobacco-derived and synthetic nicotine can be determined by measuring the ratio of the two different enantiomers, although means exist for adjusting the relative levels of the enantiomers or performing a synthesis that only leads to the S-enantiomer. There is limited data on the relative physiological effects of these two enantiomers, especially in people. However, the studies to date indicate that (S)-nicotine is more potent than (R)-nicotine and (S)-nicotine causes stronger sensations or irritation than (R)-nicotine. Studies have not been adequate to determine the relative addictiveness of the two enantiomers in people. Pod mod electronic cigarettes use nicotine in the form of a protonated nicotine, rather than free-base nicotine found in earlier generations. === Preparation === The first laboratory preparation of nicotine (as its racemate) was described in 1904. The starting material was an N-substituted pyrrole derivative, which was heated to convert it by a [1,5] sigmatropic shift to the isomer with a carbon bond between the pyrrole and pyridine rings, followed by methylation and selective reduction of the pyrrole ring using tin and hydrochloric acid. Many other syntheses of nicotine, in both racemic and chiral forms have since been published. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthetic pathway of nicotine involves a coupling reaction between the two cyclic structures that comprise nicotine. Metabolic studies show that the pyridine ring of nicotine is derived from niacin (nicotinic acid) while the pyrrolidine is derived from N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation. Biosynthesis of the two component structures proceeds via two independent syntheses, the NAD pathway for niacin and the tropane pathway for N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation. The NAD pathway in the genus Nicotiana begins with the oxidation of aspartic acid into α-amino succinate by aspartate oxidase (AO). This is followed by a condensation with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and a cyclization catalyzed by quinolinate synthase (QS) to give quinolinic acid. Quinolinic acid then reacts with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate catalyzed by quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (QPT) to form niacin mononucleotide (NaMN). The reaction now proceeds via the NAD salvage cycle to produce niacin via the conversion of nicotinamide by the enzyme nicotinamidase. The N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation used in the synthesis of nicotine is an intermediate in the synthesis of tropane-derived alkaloids. Biosynthesis begins with decarboxylation of ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to produce putrescine. Putrescine is then converted into N-methyl putrescine via methylation by SAM catalyzed by putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT). N-methyl putrescine then undergoes deamination into 4-methylaminobutanal by the N-methyl putrescine oxidase (MPO) enzyme, 4-methylaminobutanal then spontaneously cyclize into N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation. The final step in the synthesis of nicotine is the coupling between N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation and niacin. Although studies conclude some form of coupling between the two component structures, the definite process and mechanism remains undetermined. The current agreed theory involves the conversion of niacin into 2,5-dihydropyridine through 3,6-dihydronicotinic acid. The 2,5-dihydropyridine intermediate would then react with N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrollidium cation to form enantiomerically pure (−)-nicotine. === Detection in body fluids === Nicotine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or to facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Urinary or salivary cotinine concentrations are frequently measured for the purposes of pre-employment and health insurance medical screening programs. Careful interpretation of results is important, since passive exposure to cigarette smoke can result in significant accumulation of nicotine, followed by the appearance of its metabolites in various body fluids. Nicotine use is not regulated in competitive sports programs. === Methods for analysis of enantiomers === Methods for measuring the two enantiomers are straightforward and include normal-phase liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography with a chiral column. However, since methods can be used to alter the two enantiomers, it may not be possible to distinguish tobacco-derived from synthetic nicotine simply by measuring the levels of the two enantiomers. A new approach uses hydrogen and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance to distinguish tobacco-derived and synthetic nicotine based on differences the substrates used in the natural synthetic pathway performed in the tobacco plant and the substrates most used in synthesis. Another approach measures the carbon-14 content which also differs between natural and laboratory-based tobacco. These methods remain to be fully evaluated and validated using a wide range of samples. == Natural occurrence == Nicotine is a secondary metabolite produced in a variety of plants in the family Solanaceae, most notably in tobacco Nicotiana tabacum, where it can be found at high concentrations of 0.5 to 7.5%. Nicotine is also found in the leaves of other tobacco species, such as Nicotiana rustica (in amounts of 2–14%). Nicotine production is strongly induced in response to wounding as part of a jasmonate-dependent reaction. Specialist insects on tobacco, such as the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), have a number of adaptations to the detoxification and even adaptive re-purposing of nicotine. Nicotine is also found at low concentrations in the nectar of tobacco plants, where it may promote outcrossing by affecting the behavior of hummingbird pollinators. Nicotine occurs in smaller amounts (varying from 2–7 μg/kg, or 20–70 millionths of a percent wet weight) in other Solanaceaeous plants, including some crop species such as potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers, as well as non-crop species such as Duboisia hopwoodii. The amounts of nicotine in tomatoes lowers substantially as the fruit ripens. A 1999 report found ""In some papers it is suggested that the contribution of dietary nicotine intake is significant when compared with exposure to ETS [environmental tobacco smoke] or by active smoking of small numbers of cigarettes. Others consider the dietary intake to be negligible unless inordinately large amounts of specific vegetables are consumed."" The amount of nicotine eaten per day is roughly around 1.4 and 2.25 μg/day at the 95th percentile. These numbers may be low due to insufficient food intake data. The concentrations of nicotine in vegetables are difficult to measure accurately, since they are very low (parts per billion range). Pure nicotine tastes ""terrible"". == History, society and culture == Nicotine was originally isolated from the tobacco plant in 1828 by chemists Wilhelm Heinrich Posselt and Karl Ludwig Reimann from Germany, who believed it was a poison. Its chemical empirical formula was described by Melsens in 1843, its structure was discovered by Adolf Pinner and Richard Wolffenstein in 1893, and it was first synthesized by Amé Pictet and A. Rotschy in 1904. Nicotine is named after the tobacco plant Nicotiana tabacum, which in turn is named after the French ambassador in Portugal, Jean Nicot de Villemain, who sent tobacco and seeds to Paris in 1560, presented to the French King, and who promoted their medicinal use. Smoking was believed to protect against illness, particularly the plague. Tobacco was introduced to Europe in 1559, and by the late 17th century, it was used not only for smoking but also as an insecticide. After World War II, over 2,500 tons of nicotine insecticide were used worldwide, but by the 1980s the use of nicotine insecticide had declined below 200 tons. This was due to the availability of other insecticides that are cheaper and less harmful to mammals. The nicotine content of popular American-brand cigarettes has increased over time, and one study found that there was an average increase of 1.78% per year between the years of 1998 and 2005. Although methods of production of synthetic nicotine have existed for decades, it was believed that the cost of making nicotine by laboratory synthesis was cost prohibitive compared to extracting nicotine from tobacco. However, recently synthetic nicotine started to be found in different brands of e-cigarettes and oral pouches and marketed as ""tobacco-free."" The US FDA is tasked with reviewing tobacco products such as e-cigarettes and determining which can be authorized for sale. In response to the likelihood that FDA would not authorize many e-cigarettes to be marketed, e-cigarette companies began marketing products that they claimed to contain nicotine that were not made or derived from tobacco, but contained synthetic nicotine instead, and thus, would be outside FDA's tobacco regulatory authority. Similarly, nicotine pouches that claimed to contain non-tobacco (synthetic) nicotine were also introduced. The cost of synthetic nicotine has decreased as the market for the product increased. In March 2022, the U.S. Congress passed a law (the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022) that expanded FDA's tobacco regulatory authority to include tobacco products containing nicotine from any source, thereby including products made with synthetic nicotine. === Legal status === In the United States, nicotine products and nicotine replacement therapy products like Nicotrol are only available to people 18 and above; proof of age is required; not for sale in vending machine or from any source where proof of age cannot be verified. As of 2019, the minimum age to purchase tobacco in the US is 21 at the federal level. In the European Union, the minimum age to purchase nicotine products is 18. However, there is no minimum age requirement to use tobacco or nicotine products. In the United Kingdom, the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 implemented the European directive 2014/40/EU, amended by Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and the Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. Additionally other regulations limit advertising, sale and display of tobacco products and other products containing nicotine for human consumption. The Sunak government proposed banning disposable vapes to limit their appeal and affordability for children and to reduce the amount of waste generated. === In media === In some anti-smoking literature, the harm that tobacco smoking and nicotine addiction does is personified as Nick O'Teen, represented as a humanoid with some aspect of a cigarette or cigarette butt about him or his clothes and hat. Nick O'Teen was a villain that was created for the Health Education Council. The character was featured in three animated anti-smoking public service announcements in which he tries to get kids addicted to cigarettes before being foiled by the DC Comics character Superman. Nicotine was often compared to caffeine in advertisements in the 1980s by the tobacco industry, and later in the 2010s by the electronic cigarettes industry, in an effort to reduce the stigmatization and the public perception of the risks associated with nicotine use. == Research == === Central nervous system === While acute/initial nicotine intake causes activation of neuronal nicotine receptors, chronic low doses of nicotine use leads to desensitization of those receptors (due to the development of tolerance) and results in an antidepressant effect, with early research showing low dose nicotine patches could be an effective treatment of major depressive disorder in non-smokers. Though tobacco smoking is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, there is evidence that nicotine itself has the potential to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease. Smoking is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease; however, it is unknown whether this is due to people with healthier brain dopaminergic reward centers (the area of the brain affected by Parkinson's) being more likely to enjoy smoking and thus pick up the habit, nicotine directly acting as a neuroprotective agent, or other compounds in cigarette smoke acting as neuroprotective agents. === Immune system === Immune cells of both the innate immune system and adaptive immune systems frequently express the α2, α5, α6, α7, α9, and α10 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Evidence suggests that nicotinic receptors which contain these subunits are involved in the regulation of immune function. === Optopharmacology === A photoactivatable form of nicotine, which releases nicotine when exposed to ultraviolet light with certain conditions, has been developed for studying nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in brain tissue. === Oral health === Several in vitro studies have investigated the potential effects of nicotine on a range of oral cells. A recent systematic review concluded that nicotine was unlikely to be cytotoxic to oral cells in vitro in most physiological conditions but further research is needed. Understanding the potential role of nicotine in oral health has become increasingly important given the recent introduction of novel nicotine products and their potential role in helping smokers quit. == See also == 6-Chloronicotine Nicotine marketing == References == == External links == Toxicology monograph for Nicotine from the Hazardous Substances Data Bank Chemical Hazards monograph for Nicotine from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Laboratory Chemical Safety Summary for Nicotine from PubChem"	MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -6.704273e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -1.569009e-05, ' FOOD': -0.049066465}
84	Cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one	PUBMED	 The mechanism and stereochemistry in connection with enzymatic conversion of cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one into cholestanol was studied. Rat and mouse liver microsomes are able to catalyze NADPH-dependent sequential saturation of the two double bonds. Evidence was obtained that the saturation of the delta 6-double bond includes transfer of a hydride ion from the B-side of the cofactor to the 7-position of the steroid (mainly 7 beta-position), followed by addition of a proton to the 6 alpha-position (mainly trans addition). The saturation of the delta 4-double bond includes transfer of a hydride ion from the B-side of the cofactor to the 5 alpha-position of the steroid followed by addition of a proton to the 4 beta-position (trans addition). The reduction of the 3-oxo group was found to involve transfer of a hydride ion from the B-side of the cofactor NADPH to the 3 alpha-position of the steroid. The results are in accord with the contention that the enzymatic saturation of the two double bonds involves a polarization of the 3-oxo group making C-7 electrophilic and C-6 nucleophilic in connection with the saturation of the delta 6-double bond and C-5 electrophilic and C-4 nucleophilic in connection with the saturation of the delta 4-double bond. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease where the basic defect is a lack of the mitochondrial C27-steroid 26-hydroxylase involved in bile acid synthesis (EC 1.14.13.15). Cholestanol and cholesterol accumulate in all tissues. At least part of the accumulation of cholestanol is due to a 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of early bile acid intermediates. Cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one, a proposed intermediate in this pathway, is found in increased concentrations in serum of the patients. This study shows that cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one may be metabolized to 4-cholesten-3-one and cholestanol by liver, adrenals and brain. No conversion was found in intestinal mucosa or in kidneys. The capacity to convert cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one into 4-cholesten-3-one and cholestanol varied in different tissues as well as in different species. The results are discussed in relation to the cholestanol accumulation in CTX.	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': -0.022410609, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
85	Bifonazole	WIKIPEDIA	Bifonazole (trade name Canespor among others) is an imidazole antifungal drug used in form of ointments. It was patented in 1974 and approved for medical use in 1983. There are also combinations with carbamide for the treatment of onychomycosis. == Adverse effects == The most common side effect is a burning sensation at the application site. Other reactions, such as itching, eczema or skin dryness, are rare. Bifonazole is a potent aromatase inhibitor in vitro. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Bifonazole has a dual mode of action. It inhibits fungal ergosterol biosynthesis at two points, via transformation of 24-methylendihydrolanosterol to desmethylsterol, together with inhibition of HMG-CoA. This enables fungicidal properties against dermatophytes and distinguishes bifonazole from other antifungal drugs. === Pharmacokinetics === Six hours after application, bifonazole concentrations range from 1000 μg/cm3 in the stratum corneum to 5 μg/cm3 in the papillary dermis. == Synthesis == Friedel-Crafts acylation between biphenyl (1) and benzoyl chloride (2) gives 4-phenylbenzophenone (3). Reduction with sodium borohydride gives the alcohol (4). Halogenation by thionyl chloride gives (5). Amination with imidazole (6) completes the synthesis of bifonazole. == References == == Further reading ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
86	Bufexamac	WIKIPEDIA	Bufexamac is a drug used as an anti-inflammatory agent on the skin, as well as rectally. Common brand names include Paraderm and Parfenac. It was withdrawn in Europe and Australia because of allergic reactions. == Indications == Ointments and lotions containing bufexamac are used for the treatment of subacute and chronic eczema of the skin, including atopic eczema, as well as sunburn and other minor burns, and itching. Suppositories containing bufexamac in combination with local anaesthetics are used against haemorrhoids. == Pharmacology == Bufexamac is thought to act by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which would make it a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Evidence on the mechanism of action is scarce. Furthermore, bufexamac was identified as a specific inhibitor of class IIB histone deacetylases (HDAC6 and HDAC10). == Side effects == Bufexamac can cause severe contact dermatitis which is often hard to distinguish from the initial condition. As a consequence, the European Medicines Agency recommended to withdraw the marketing approval in April 2010. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07}

89	Chrysin	WIKIPEDIA	"Chrysin, also called 5,7-dihydroxyflavone, is a flavone found in honey, propolis, the passion flowers, Passiflora caerulea and Passiflora incarnata, and in Oroxylum indicum. It is extracted from various plants, such as the blue passion flower (Passiflora caerulea). Following oral intake by humans, chrysin has low bioavailability and rapid excretion. It is under basic research to evaluate its safety and potential biological effects. Chrysin is an ingredient in dietary supplements. As of 2016, there was no clinical use of chrysin, and no evidence for its effect on testosterone levels. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration did not recommend chrysin be included on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. == Occurrence == A component in various medicinal plants (e.g. Scutellaria baicalensis), chrysin is a dihydroxyflavone, a type of flavonoid. It is also found in honey, propolis, the passion flowers, Passiflora caerulea and Passiflora incarnata, in Oroxylum indicum, carrots, chamomile, many fruits, and in mushrooms, such as the mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus. It is extracted from various plants, such as the blue passion flower (Passiflora caerulea). The amount of chrysin in honey from various plant sources is about 0.2 mg per 100 g. Chrysin is typically found at higher amounts in propolis than in honey. A 2010 study found the amount of chrysin was 0.10 mg/kg in honeydew honey, and 5.3 mg/kg in forest honeys. A 2010 study found the amount of chrysin in propolis was as much as 28 g/L. A 2013 study found the amount of chrysin in various mushrooms from the island of Lesvos, Greece, varied between 0.17 mg/kg in Lactarius deliciosus to 0.34 mg/kg in Suillus bellinii. == Bioavailability == The effects of chrysin are reliant on its bioavailability and solubility. Following oral intake by humans, chrysin has low bioavailability and rapid excretion. As a result, it is poorly absorbed. A 1998 study determined that the highest amounts in plasma was from 12 to 64 nM. As of 2015, the serum levels of chrysin have not been cited in the literature. Following oral intake by humans, the bioavailability was reported to be from 0.003% to 0.02%. == Oral and topical application == There is insufficient information to determine how long chrysin has been used in pharmacy compounding. Chrysin is used as an ingredient in dietary supplements, but there is no information on systemic exposure from topical application. As of 2016, there was no evidence to support any effect of oral chrysin on testosterone levels, or an any disease-modifying activity with oral or topical formulations. == Safety == A daily consumed amount of chrysin of 0.5 to 3 g is considered safe. As of 2016, there was no toxicity attributable to chrysin in clinical trials or adverse event reporting. As of 2016, clinical safety issues have not been identified. As of 2016, nonclinical data suggest potential concerns. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration did not recommend chrysin be included on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act based on consideration of the following criteria: (1) physicochemical characterization; (2) safety; (3) effectiveness; and (4) historical use of the substance in compounding. == Research == As of 2016, there is no evidence for chrysin being used in human clinical applications. Research showed that orally administered chrysin does not have clinical activity as an aromatase inhibitor. Nanoformulations of polyphenols, including chrysin, are made using various carrier methods, such as liposomes and nanocapsules. == Bibliography == Brave M (23 June 2016). ""Chrysin"" (PDF).

91	Pistillarin	PUBMED	 Ramaria botrytis is a popular mushroom in Asian countries, particularly known for its crispy texture and rich nutrient content. In this study, we found potent lipid peroxidation-inhibiting activity in this mushroom and identified the active compound associated with this activity as pistillarin. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of pistillarin in R. botrytis. Our study is the first to investigate the inhibitory effects of pistillarin against physiological reactive oxygen species such as 1O2, •OH, and O2- and lipid peroxidation, which damages living tissues. We also clarified its characteristic antioxidant activities, with no 1O2 and •OH quenching activity (IC50 > 100 μМ), moderate O2- quenching activity (IC50 of 10.2 μМ), and potent lipid peroxidation-inhibiting activity (IC50 of 0.66 μМ), for the first time. Furthermore, we found a new pistillarin-related compound (pistillarin B) in salted R. botrytis. We isolated pistillarin B, determined its structure, and examined its lipid peroxidation-inhibiting activity (IC50 of 6.88 μМ).	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -0.004172899, 'OD': 0.0}
92	Tangeretin	WIKIPEDIA	Tangeretin is an O-polymethoxylated flavone that is found in tangerine and other citrus peels. Tangeretin strengthens the cell wall and acts as a plant's defensive mechanism against disease-causing pathogens. It has also been used as a marker compound to detect contamination in citrus juices. The following is a list of methods used to extract tangeretin from citrus peels: column chromatography preparative-high performance liquid chromatography super critical fluid chromatography high speed counter current chromatography a combination of vacuum flash silica gel chromatography and flash C8 column chromatography flash chromatography isolation using ionic liquids and a cycle of centrifugation and decantation The low solubility of Tangeretin is one of the main reasons for the low bioavailability of Tangeretin (and other flavonoids in general), and has been reported as a major challenge when using the compound in laboratory procedures. However, methods for tangeretin extraction are currently being tested to maximize efficiency and percent yields as its uses in treatment of cancer and other diseases are becoming better understood. Tangeretin is commercially available as a dietary supplement. Tangeretin has also demonstrated beneficial applications in other pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic processes.

96	Cromolyn	WIKIPEDIA	"Cromoglicic acid (INN)—also referred to as cromolyn (USAN), cromoglycate (former BAN), or cromoglicate—is traditionally described as a mast cell stabilizer, and is commonly marketed as the sodium salt sodium cromoglicate or cromolyn sodium. This drug prevents the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells. It is considered a breakthrough drug in management of asthma, as the patients can be freed from steroids in many cases; however, it is mainly effective as a prophylaxis for allergic and exercise-induced asthma, not as a treatment for acute asthma attacks. Cromoglicic acid has been the non-corticosteroid treatment of choice in the treatment of asthma, for which it has largely been replaced by leukotriene receptor antagonists because of their safety and convenience. Cromoglicic acid requires administration four times daily, and does not provide additive benefit in combination with inhaled corticosteroids. == History == Cromolyn was discovered in 1965 by Roger Altounyan, a pharmacologist who had asthma. Altounyan was investigating certain plants and herbs which have bronchodilating properties. One such plant was khella (Ammi visnaga) which had been used as a muscle relaxant since ancient times in Egypt. Altounyan deliberately inhaled derivatives of the active ingredient khellin to determine if they could block his asthma attacks. After several years of trial, he isolated an effective and safe asthma-preventing compound called cromolyn sodium. == Preparations == Cromoglicic acid is available in multiple forms: as a nasal spray (Rynacrom (UK), Lomusol (France), Nasalcrom (the only over-the-counter form, US), Prevalin (non-direct version, NL)) to treat allergic rhinitis. in a nebulizer solution for aerosol administration to treat asthma. as an inhaler (Intal, Fisons Pharmaceuticals, UK) for preventive management of asthma. The maker of Intal, King Pharmaceuticals, has discontinued manufacturing the inhaled form, cromolyn sodium inhalation aerosol, due to issues involving CFC-free propellant. As stocks are depleted, this inhaler preparation will no longer be available to patients. In the EU it is manufactured without CFCs by Sanofi, although it must be imported from Canada or Mexico for USA residents. as eye drops (Opticrom and Optrex Allergy (UK), Crolom, Cromolyn (Canada)) for allergic conjunctivitis in an oral form (Gastrocrom, Nalcrom) to treat mastocytosis, mast cell activation syndrome, dermatographic urticaria and ulcerative colitis. Another oral product, Intercron (sodium cromoglicate in distilled water, from Zambon France), is used for food allergies. == Mechanism of action == ""Cromolyn works because it prevents the release of mediators that would normally attract inflammatory cells and because it stabilizes the inflammatory cells. MCT mast cells found in the mucosa are stabilised."" Nedocromil is another mast cell stabilizer that also works in controlling asthma. The underlying mechanism of action is not fully understood; for while cromoglicate stabilizes mast cells, this mechanism is probably not why it works in asthma. Pharmaceutical companies have produced 20 related compounds that are equally or more potent at stabilising mast cells and none of them have shown any anti-asthmatic effect. It is more likely that these work by inhibiting the response of sensory C fibers to the irritant capsaicin, inhibiting local axon reflexes involved in asthma, and may inhibit the release of preformed T cell cytokines and mediators involved in asthma. It is known to somewhat inhibit chloride channels (37% ± 7%) and thus may inhibit the: exaggerated neuronal reflexes triggered by stimulation of irritant receptors on sensory nerve endings (e.g. exercise-induced asthma) release of preformed cytokines from several type of inflammatory cells (T cells, eosinophils) in allergen-induced asthma Note: Another chemical (NPPB: 5-nitro-2(3-phenyl) propylamino-benzoic acid) was shown, in the same study, to be a more effective chloride channel blocker. Finally it may act by inhibiting calcium influx. Cromoglicate is classified as a chromone. Cromolyn is also being tested as a drug to treat insulin-induced lipoatrophy and Alzheimer's disease in combination with Ibuprofen. Cromolyn is also known to bind S100P protein and disrupt the interaction with RAGE. == Synthesis == == See also == Visnaga daucoides == References == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}

99	Apigenin	WIKIPEDIA	Apigenin (4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavone), found in many plants, is a natural product belonging to the flavone class that is the aglycone of several naturally occurring glycosides. It is a yellow crystalline solid that has been used to dye wool. == Sources in nature == Apigenin is found in many fruits and vegetables, but parsley, celery, celeriac, and chamomile tea are the most common sources. Apigenin is particularly abundant in the flowers of chamomile plants, constituting 68% of total flavonoids. Dried parsley can contain about 45 mg apigenin/gram of the herb, and dried chamomile flower about 3–5 mg/gram. The apigenin content of fresh parsley is reportedly 215.5 mg/100 grams, which is much higher than the next highest food source, green celery hearts providing 19.1 mg/100 grams. == Pharmacology == Apigenin competitively binds to the benzodiazepine site on GABAA receptors. There exist conflicting findings regarding how apigenin interacts with this site. Apigenin can increase the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and CAT, helping to reduce oxidative stress. == Biosynthesis == Apigenin is biosynthetically derived from the general phenylpropanoid pathway and the flavone synthesis pathway. The phenylpropanoid pathway starts from the aromatic amino acids L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine, both products of the Shikimate pathway. When starting from L-phenylalanine, first the amino acid is non-oxidatively deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to make cinnamate, followed by oxidation at the para position by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) to produce p-coumarate. As L-tyrosine is already oxidized at the para position, it skips this oxidation and is simply deaminated by tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) to arrive at p-coumarate. To complete the general phenylpropanoid pathway, 4-coumarate CoA ligase (4CL) substitutes coenzyme A (CoA) at the carboxy group of p-coumarate. Entering the flavone synthesis pathway, the type III polyketide synthase enzyme chalcone synthase (CHS) uses consecutive condensations of three equivalents of malonyl CoA followed by aromatization to convert p-coumaroyl-CoA to chalcone. Chalcone isomerase (CHI) then isomerizes the product to close the pyrone ring to make naringenin. Finally, a flavanone synthase (FNS) enzyme oxidizes naringenin to apigenin. Two types of FNS have previously been described; FNS I, a soluble enzyme that uses 2-oxogluturate, Fe2+, and ascorbate as cofactors and FNS II, a membrane bound, NADPH dependent cytochrome p450 monooxygenase. == Glycosides == The naturally occurring glycosides formed by the combination of apigenin with sugars include: Apiin (apigenin 7-O-apioglucoside), isolated from parsley and celery Apigetrin (apigenin 7-glucoside), found in dandelion coffee Vitexin (apigenin 8-C-glucoside) Isovitexin (apigenin 6-C-glucoside) Rhoifolin (apigenin 7-O-neohesperidoside) Schaftoside (apigenin 6-C-glucoside 8-C-arabinoside) == In diet == Some foods contain relatively high amounts of apigenin: == See also == Amentoflavone == References ==	MEDICAL, FOOD	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	{'FO': -4.4537377e-05, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -0.15000616, ' PERSON': -0.00091313245, 'AL': -3.1281633e-07, ' CARE': 0.0}
100	Tryptophan	WIKIPEDIA	"Tryptophan (symbol Trp or W) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan contains an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a polar molecule with a non-polar aromatic beta carbon substituent. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3 (niacin). It is encoded by the codon UGG. Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (–NH+3; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( –COO−; pKa = 2.38). Humans and many animals cannot synthesize tryptophan: they need to obtain it through their diet, making it an essential amino acid. Tryptophan is named after the digestive enzymes trypsin, which were used in its first isolation from casein proteins. It was assigned the one-letter symbol W based on the double ring being visually suggestive to the bulky letter. == Function == Amino acids, including tryptophan, are used as building blocks in protein biosynthesis, and proteins are required to sustain life. Tryptophan is among the less common amino acids found in proteins, but it plays important structural or functional roles whenever it occurs. For instance, tryptophan and tyrosine residues play special roles in ""anchoring"" membrane proteins within the cell membrane. Tryptophan, along with other aromatic amino acids, is also important in glycan-protein interactions. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds: Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase. Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes. Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids. Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan. The disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression. In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop, and when the cell's tryptophan levels go down again, transcription from the trp operon resumes. This permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell's internal and external tryptophan levels. == Recommended dietary allowance == In 2002, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5 mg/kg body weight/day of tryptophan for adults 19 years and over. === Dietary sources === Tryptophan is present in most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan, the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry. == Medical use == === Depression === Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. In 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that ""the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive"" and note that ""because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present"". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence. === Insomnia === The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of tryptophan in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness. == Side effects == Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). == Interactions == Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs. Because tryptophan supplementation has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, its interactions with other drugs are not well known. == Isolation == The isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901. Hopkins recovered tryptophan from hydrolysed casein, recovering 4–8 g of tryptophan from 600 g of crude casein. == Biosynthesis and industrial production == As an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins. Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerol phosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine. The industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified bacteria such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, C. glutamicum or E. coli. These strains carry mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase. == Society and culture == === Showa Denko contamination scandal === There was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit. Subsequent studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko's L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. However, other evidence suggests that tryptophan itself may be a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. There are also claims that a precursor reached sufficient concentrations to form a toxic dimer. The FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005. The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of L-tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been cited as evidence of a need for ""close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products"". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech. === Turkey meat and drowsiness hypothesis === A common assertion in the US and the UK is that heavy consumption of turkey meat—as seen during Thanksgiving and Christmas—results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable with that of other meats. Drowsiness after eating may be caused by other foods eaten with the turkey, particularly carbohydrates. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan, into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in more uptake of tryptophan across the blood–brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into the hormone melatonin—which is an important mediator of the circadian rhythm—by the pineal gland. Hence, these data suggest that ""feast-induced drowsiness""—or postprandial somnolence—may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which indirectly increases the production of melatonin in the brain, and thereby promotes sleep. == Research == === Yeast amino acid metabolism === In 1912 Felix Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast metabolizes the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol. === Serotonin precursor === Tryptophan affects brain serotonin synthesis when given orally in a purified form and is used to modify serotonin levels for research. Low brain serotonin level is induced by administration of tryptophan-poor protein in a technique called acute tryptophan depletion. Studies using this method have evaluated the effect of serotonin on mood and social behavior, finding that serotonin reduces aggression and increases agreeableness. === Psychedelic effects === Tryptophan produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at sufficiently high doses. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects. Tryptophan is converted into the trace amine tryptamine and tryptamine is N-methylated by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) into N-methyltryptamine (NMT) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT), which are known serotonergic psychedelics. === Fluorescence === Tryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of the microenvironment around the tryptophan residue. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of tryptophan residues. == See also == 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) α-Methyltryptophan Acree–Rosenheim reaction Adamkiewicz reaction Attenuator (genetics) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine Hopkins–Cole reaction Serotonin Tryptamine == References == == Further reading == == External links =="	MEDICAL, FOOD	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.02729155, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': -1.9361265e-07, ',': -2.9352968e-06, ' FOOD': -0.0051684123, ' MED': -2.2365493e-05, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07}
101	Tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate	PUBMED	 Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are emerging contaminants of growing concern, and there is limited information about the bacterial transformation of OPEs. In this study, we investigated the biotransformation of tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), a frequently detected alkyl-OPE by a bacterial enrichment culture under aerobic conditions. The enrichment culture degraded 5 mg/L TBOEP following the first-order kinetics with a reaction rate constant of 0.314 h Tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) is a plasticizer present in indoor dust, reaching levels of several micrograms per gram. Such levels could lead to significant daily exposure of adults and children. Currently, no toxicokinetic data are available to estimate TBOEP clearance in humans after uptake and therefore, one objective of this study was to investigate intrinsic clearance of TBOEP by human liver microsome (HLM) and serum enzymes. Another objective was to generate information to identify and prioritize several metabolites of TBOEP for investigation of human exposure by biomonitoring. 1D and 2D-NMR methodologies were successfully applied on a mixture of the metabolites to confirm the structure of 3-HO-TBOEP (bis(2-butoxyethyl) 3-hydroxyl-2-butoxyethyl phosphate) and to tentatively assign structures to 1-HO-TBOEP and 2-HO-TBOEP. HO-TBOEP isomers and bis(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (BBOEP), bis(2-butoxyethyl) hydroxyethyl phosphate (BBOEHEP) were further monitored by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Rates of formation of BBOEHEP and HO-TBOEP metabolites by liver enzymes were best described by the Michaelis-Menten model. Apparent Km values for BBOEHEP, 3-HO-TBOEP, and sum of 1- and 2-HO-TBOEP isomer formation were 152, 197 and 148μM, respectively. Apparent Vmax values for the formation of BBOEHEP, 3-HO-TBOEP, and the sum of 1- and 2-HO-TBOEP isomers were 2560, 643, and 254pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. No detectable formation of BBOEP occurred with liver or serum enzymes. Our findings indicate that intrinsic clearance of TBOEP is mainly catalyzed by oxidative enzymes in the liver and that its major in vitro metabolite is BBOEHEP. These findings can be applied in human biomonitoring studies and risk assessment. Tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP; 20 µg/kg b.w.) was orally administered to three female and three male volunteers. In urine samples collected for 39 h three metabolites of TBOEP were quantitated. bis(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (BBOEP), tris(2-(3-hydroxy)butoxyethyl) phosphate (OH-TBOEP), bis(2-butoxyethyl)-(2-hydroxyethyl) phosphate (BBOEHEP) were observed in all urine samples within the first 7 h with highest concentration for BBOEHEP.

103	Isoallolithocholic acid	PUBMED	 1-Kestose (kestose) is the smallest fructooligosaccharide component and shows a particularly high prebiotic function. Both kestose and the bile acid metabolite isoallolithocholic acid (isoalloLCA) are known to be beneficial for human health, especially in terms of immune homeostasis in the gastrointestinal system; however, the effect of kestose on the levels of microbial isoalloLCA producers remains to be clarified. IsoalloLCA is known to be produced by several members of the phylum Bacteroidota that carry the 5α-reductase (5AR) gene, a key isoalloLCA biosynthetic gene. Thus, we designed a specific primer set to detect the 5AR gene based on the consensus sequences of the genes from several isoalloLCA producers. Using real-time quantitative PCR with this primer set and fecal DNA samples, we compared the 5AR gene level (5ar-level) in the intestinal microbiota of a kestose-supplemented group (n=20) and a placebo group (n=16) before and after intake for 12 wk. The 5ar-level was significantly increased in the kestose-supplemented group (p=0.015), but not in the placebo group (p=0.379), indicating that kestose supplementation increased the 5ar-level in human intestinal microbiota. Our findings suggest that targeting functional gene levels could potentially be used to predict and understand the beneficial prebiotic effects associated with changes in gut microbiota. A significant increase in multidrug-resistant Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections has made it crucial to explore new antimicrobial drugs and strategies. Emerging evidence suggests that the bile acid metabolite isoallolithocholic acid (isoallo-LCA) may contribute to reducing the risk of infection among centenarians. However, its precise role remains somewhat ambiguous and necessitates further investigation. This study aims to investigate the roles of isoallo-LCA in MRSA-associated peritoneal infection. The effects of isoallo-LCA on peritoneal infection are examined in a MRSA-induced peritoneal infected model. Antibacterial activity, biofilm formation assay, and bacterial membrane permeability experiments are conducted to explore the mechanisms involved. Our findings demonstrate that isoallo-LCA effectively suppresses the replication of MRSA with minimal adverse effects on mammalian cells. Furthermore, isoallo-LCA significantly inhibits the formation of bacterial biofilms and eradicates existing bacterial biofilms of MRSA. Administration of isoallo-LCA reduces MRSA colonization in peritoneal organs and alleviates peritonitis-related inflammation and damage in a MRSA-infected peritonitis mice. Mechanistically, isoallo-LCA exhibits potent bactericidal activity against MRSA by disrupting the integrity and permeability of bacterial cells. In addition, isoallo-LCA also enhances the macrophage phagocytosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that isoallo-LCA could be an effective treatment for infections caused by MRSA.

104	Luteolin	WIKIPEDIA	Luteolin is a flavone, a type of flavonoid, with a yellow crystalline appearance. Luteolin is the main yellow dye from the Reseda luteola plant, used for dyeing since at least the first millennium B.C. Luteolin was first isolated in pure form, and named, in 1829 by the French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul. The luteolin empirical formula was determined by the Austrian chemists Heinrich Hlasiwetz and Leopold Pfaundler in 1864. In 1896, the English chemist Arthur George Perkin proposed the correct structure for luteolin. Perkin's proposed structure for luteolin was confirmed in 1900 when the Polish-Swiss chemist Stanislaw Kostanecki (1860–1910) and his students A. Różycki and J. Tambor synthesized luteolin. == Natural occurrences == Luteolin is most often found in leaves, but it is also present in rinds, barks, clover blossoms, and ragweed pollen. It has also been isolated from the aromatic flowering plant, Salvia tomentosa in the mint family, Lamiaceae. Dietary sources include celery, broccoli, artichoke, green pepper, parsley, thyme, dandelion, perilla, chamomile tea, carrots, olive oil, peppermint, rosemary, navel oranges, and oregano. It can also be found in the seeds of the palm Aiphanes aculeata. == References == == External links == Media related to Luteolin at Wikimedia Commons	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -8.7450695e-05, 'OD': 0.0}
105	Trimethoprim	WIKIPEDIA	Trimethoprim (TMP) is an antibiotic used mainly in the treatment of bladder infections. Other uses include for middle ear infections and travelers' diarrhea. With sulfamethoxazole or dapsone it may be used for Pneumocystis pneumonia in people with HIV/AIDS. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). Common side effects include nausea, changes in taste, and rash. Rarely it may result in blood problems such as not enough platelets or white blood cells. Trimethoprim may cause sun sensitivity. There is evidence of potential harm during pregnancy in some animals but not humans. It works by blocking folate metabolism via dihydrofolate reductase in some bacteria, preventing creation of bacterial DNA and RNA and leading to bacterial cell death. Trimethoprim was first used in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == It is primarily used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, although it may be used against any susceptible aerobic bacterial species. It may also be used to treat and prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. It is generally not recommended for the treatment of anaerobic infections such as Clostridioides difficile colitis (the leading cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhea). Trimethoprim has been used in trials to treat retinitis. Resistance to trimethoprim is increasing, but it is still a first-line antibiotic in many countries. === Spectrum of susceptibility === Cultures and susceptibility tests should be done to make sure bacteria are treated by trimethoprim. Escherichia coli Proteus mirabilis Klebsiella pneumoniae Enterobacter species Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, including S. saprophyticus Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae == Side effects == === Common === Nauseas Change in taste Vomiting Diarrhea Rashes Sun sensitivity Itchiness === Rare === Can cause thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) by lowering folic acid levels; this may also cause megaloblastic anemia. Trimethoprim antagonizes the epithelial sodium channel in the distal tubule, thus acting like amiloride. This can cause increased potassium levels in the body (hyperkalemia). Can compete with creatinine for secretion into the renal tubule. This can cause an artificial rise in the serum creatinine. Use in EHEC infections may lead to an increase in expression of Shiga toxin. === Contraindications === Known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim History of megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency It may be involved in a reaction similar to disulfiram when alcohol is consumed after it is used, in particular when used in combination with sulfamethoxazole. === Pregnancy === Based on the studies that show that trimethoprim crosses the placenta and can affect folate metabolism, there has been growing evidence of the risk of structural birth defects associated with trimethoprim, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. The trophoblasts in the early fetus are sensitive to changes in the folate cycle. A 2013 study found a doubling in the risk of miscarriage in women exposed to trimethoprim in the early pregnancy. == Mechanism of action == Trimethoprim binds to dihydrofolate reductase and inhibits the reduction of dihydrofolic acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). THF is an essential precursor in the thymidine synthesis pathway and interference with this pathway inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. Trimethoprim's inhibitory activity for bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is sixty thousand times greater than for human dihydrofolate reductase. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, an enzyme involved further upstream in the same pathway. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are commonly used in combination due to possible synergistic effects, and reduced development of resistance. This benefit has been questioned. == History == Trimethoprim was first used in 1962. In 1972, it was used as a prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections in Finland. Its name is derived from trimethyloxy-pyrimidine. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
111	Oxfendazole	WIKIPEDIA	Oxfendazole is a broad spectrum benzimidazole anthelmintic. Its main use is for protecting livestock against roundworm, strongyles and pinworms. Oxfendazole is the sulfoxide metabolite of fenbendazole. Oxfendazole is an anthelmintic (wormer) compound used in veterinary practice. It comes under the chemical class of the benzimidazoles. This drug is barely used in horses, goats, sheep, and cattle. It is very scarcely applied on dogs and cats. The drug for livestock is majorly available in the form of pills, tablets, drenches, bolus, etc. They are meant for oral consumption. Several drenches are allowed for intraruminal injection in some of the countries. Few countries also prefer injectables and pour-ons. For pet dogs, the drug is available in the form of drenches. == Efficacy == Both oxfendazole and fenbendazole are efficacious against gastrointestinal lungworms and roundworms of livestock, adults, and L4-larvae of the significant species for example, of the genera Bunostomum, Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Oesophagostomum, Nematodirus, Teladorsagia, Cooperia, Trichostrongylus, Dictyocaulus, Trichuris, etc., including against arrested larvae of some of the species. They are even highly efficient against majority of the tapeworms commonly found in livestock. This drug works effectively against the main parasitic roundworms and tapeworms of dogs and cats. The drug offers a small residual effect in ruminants unless and otherwise it is delivered by using a slow-release device. This essentially means that on a single administration it will help in killing the parasites which are present in the host during the time of treatment and also prevent against re-infestations for some more days but not weeks or months. The residual effect is comparatively shorter in non-ruminants. The drug is non-effective against flukes and external parasites at therapeutic dose. == Adverse Effects == Since the toxicity of oxfendazole is quite low, it is generally well tolerated by most species. However, high oral doses can causes intoxication resulting in loss of appetite, diarrhea, fever, cramps, nausea, vomit and convulsions, hepatic and epicardial hemorrhage, allergic reactions etc. Due to lack of research, it is not suggested to use oxfendazole in pregnant mares and bitches. It is also not recommended to use oxfendazole tablets to treat dogs or cats. A registered veterinarian must authorize the use of oxfendazole.in any species. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Oxfendazole is sold under brand names of Synanthic (Suspension), Benzelmin (Paste), Anthelcide EQ(Paste). == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -3.1281633e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}

113	Propiconazole	WIKIPEDIA	Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide, also known as a DMI, or demethylation inhibiting fungicide due to its binding with and inhibiting the 14-alpha demethylase enzyme from demethylating a precursor to ergosterol. Without this demethylation step, the ergosterols are not incorporated into the growing fungal cell membranes, and cellular growth is stopped. == Agriculture == Propiconazole is used agriculturally as a systemic fungicide on turfgrasses grown for seed and aesthetic or athletic value, wheat, mushrooms, corn, wild rice, peanuts, almonds, sorghum, oats, pecans, apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, prunes and lemons. It is also used in combination with permethrin in formulations of wood preserver. Propiconazole is a mixture of four stereoisomers and was first developed in 1979 by Janssen Pharmaceutica. Propiconazole exhibits strong anti-feeding properties against the keratin-digesting Australian carpet beetle Anthrenocerus australis. == References == == External links == Non-CCA Wood Preservatives: Guide to Selected Resources - National Pesticide Information Center Propiconazole in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)	INDUSTRIAL	INDUSTRIAL	{'IND': 0.0, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': -7.89631e-07, 'AL': 0.0}
114	Biliverdin	WIKIPEDIA	Biliverdin (from the Latin for green bile) is a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment, and is a product of heme catabolism. It is the pigment responsible for a greenish color sometimes seen in bruises. == Metabolism == Biliverdin results from the breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin along with hemosiderin, in which biliverdin normally rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Biliverdin is seen briefly in some bruises as a green color. In bruises, its breakdown into bilirubin leads to a yellowish color. == Role in disease == Biliverdin has been found in excess in the blood of humans suffering from hepatic diseases. Jaundice is caused by the accumulation of biliverdin or bilirubin (or both) in the circulatory system and tissues. Jaundiced skin and sclera (whites of the eyes) are characteristic of liver failure. == Role in treatment of disease == While typically regarded as a mere waste product of heme breakdown, evidence that suggests that biliverdin – and other bile pigments – has a physiological role in humans has been mounting. Bile pigments such as biliverdin possess significant anti-mutagenic and antioxidant properties and therefore, may fulfil a useful physiological function. Biliverdin and bilirubin have been shown to be potent scavengers of hydroperoxyl radicals. They have also been shown to inhibit the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and oxidants – all of which are mutagens. Some studies have found that people with higher concentration levels of bilirubin and biliverdin in their bodies have a lower frequency of cancer and cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that biliverdin – as well as many other tetrapyrrolic pigments – may function as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor as well as having beneficial effects in asthma though further research is needed to confirm these results. There are currently no practical implications for using biliverdin in the treatment of any disease. == In non-human animals == Biliverdin is an important pigment component in avian egg shells, especially blue and green shells. Blue egg shells have a significantly higher concentration of biliverdin than brown egg shells. Research has shown that the biliverdin of egg shells is produced from the shell gland, rather than from the breakdown of erythrocytes in the blood stream, although there is no evidence that the sources of the material are neither tetrapyrroles nor free haem from the blood plasma. Along with its presence in avian egg shells, other studies have also shown that biliverdin is present in the blue-green blood of many marine fish, the blood of tobacco hornworm, the wings of moth and butterfly, the serum and eggs of frogs, and the placenta of dogs. With dogs this can lead, in extremely rare cases, to the birth of puppies with green fur; however, the green color fades out soon after birth. In the garfish (Belone belone) and related species, the bones are bright green because of biliverdin. The green coloration of many grasshoppers and lepidopteran larvae is also due to biliverdin. Biliverdin is also present in the green blood, muscles, bones, and mucosal lining of skinks of the genus Prasinohaema, found in New Guinea. It is uncertain whether this presence of biliverdin is an ecological or physiological adaptation of any kind. It has been suggested that accumulation of biliverdin might deter harmful infection by Plasmodium malaria parasites, although no statistically significant correlation has been established. The Cambodian frog, Chiromantis samkosensis, also exhibits this characteristic along with turquoise bones. == In fluorescence imaging == In a complex with reengineered bacterial phytochrome, biliverdin has been employed as an IR-emitting chromophore for in vivo imaging. In contrast to fluorescent proteins which form their chromophore through posttranslational modifications of the polypeptide chain, phytochromes bind an external ligand (in this case, biliverdin), and successful imaging of the first bacteriophytochrome-based probe required addition of the exogenous biliverdin. Recent studies demonstrated that bacteriophytochrome-based fluorescent proteins with high affinity to biliverdin can be imaged in vivo utilizing endogenous ligand only and, thus, with the same ease as the conventional fluorescent proteins. Advent of the second and further generations of the biliverdin-binding bacteriophytochrome-based probes should broaden the possibilities for the non-invasive in vivo imaging. A new class of fluorescent protein was evolved from a cyanobacterial (Trichodesmium erythraeum) phycobiliprotein, α-allophycocyanin, and named small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP) in 2016. smURFP autocatalytically self-incorporates the chromophore biliverdin without the need of an external protein, known as a lyase. Jellyfish- and coral-derived fluorescent proteins require oxygen and produce a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide upon chromophore formation. smURFP does not require oxygen or produce hydrogen peroxide and uses the chromophore biliverdin. smURFP has a large extinction coefficient (180,000 M−1 cm−1) and has a modest quantum yield (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and about 2-fold brighter than most red or far-red fluorescent proteins derived from coral. smURFP spectral properties are similar to the organic dye Cy5. == See also == Bilirubin Heme Stercobilin Tetrapyrrole Urobilin == References == == External links == Explaining jaundice in newborn at NHS	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	{'END': -1.6240566e-06, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -0.24579938, ' MED': -0.0011297365, 'ICAL': 0.0}
115	Urobilin	WIKIPEDIA	"Urobilin or urochrome is the chemical primarily responsible for the yellow color of urine. It is a linear tetrapyrrole compound that, along with the related colorless compound urobilinogen, are degradation products of the cyclic tetrapyrrole heme. == Metabolism == Urobilin is generated from the degradation of heme, which is first degraded through biliverdin to bilirubin. Bilirubin is then excreted as bile, which is further degraded by microbes present in the large intestine to urobilinogen. The enzyme responsible for the degradation is bilirubin reductase, which was identified in 2024. Some of this remains in the large intestine, and its conversion to stercobilin gives feces their brown color. Some is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and then delivered to the kidneys. When urobilinogen is exposed to air, it is oxidized to urobilin, which has a yellow color. == Importance == Many urine tests (urinalysis) monitor the amount of urobilin in urine, as its levels can give insight on the effectiveness of urinary tract function. Normally, urine would appear as either light yellow or colorless. A lack of water intake, for example following sleep or dehydration, reduces the water content of urine, thereby concentrating urobilin and producing a darker color of urine. Obstructive jaundice reduces biliary bilirubin excretion, which is then excreted directly from the blood stream into the urine, giving a dark-colored urine but with a paradoxically low urobilin concentration, no urobilinogen, and usually with correspondingly pale faeces. Darker urine can also be due to other chemicals, such as various ingested dietary components or drugs, porphyrins in patients with porphyria, and homogentisate in patients with alkaptonuria. == See also == Bile pigment Bilirubin Biliverdin Heme Stercobilin Urobilinogen == References == == Further reading == Bishop, Michael; Duben-Engelkirk, Janet L., and Fody, Edward P.

120	Xanthohumol	WIKIPEDIA	Xanthohumol is a natural product found in the female inflorescences of Humulus lupulus, also known as hops. This compound is also found in beer and belongs to a class of compounds that contribute to the bitterness and flavor of hops. Xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid, biosynthesized by a type III polyketide synthase (PKS) and subsequent modifying enzymes. == Biosynthesis == Xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid derived from a plant type III PKS, and is synthesized in the glandular trichromes of hop cones. L-Phenylalanine serves as the starting material, which is converted to cinnamic acid by the PLP-dependent phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Cinnamic acid is oxidized by cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and loaded onto Coenzyme A (CoA) by 4-coumarate CoA ligase to yield 4-hydroxy-cinnamoyl CoA, the starter unit for PKS extension. This molecule is extended three times with malonyl CoA, cyclized through a Claisen condensation, and aromatized through tautomerization to form naringenin chalcone (chalconaringenin). This intermediate has the potential to form a variety of different products depending on the enzymes that modify the core structure. In the case of xanthohumol, a prenyltransferase called Humulus lupulus prenyltransferase 1 (HlPT-1) attaches a molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate from the DXP pathway. HlPT-1 has a broad substrate specificity and also participates in making other prenylated flavonoids in the hop plant. Finally, an O-methyltransferase methylates a phenol substituent using S-adenosyl methionine. Total syntheses of xanthohumol and derivatives have been achieved, though extraction from hops remains a primary source. == Beer == In commercial beers, the concentration of xanthohumol ranges from about 2 μg/L – 1.2 mg/L. During the brewing process, xanthohumol and other prenylated flavonoids are lost as they are converted to the corresponding flavanones. Different hop varieties and different beers contain varying quantities of xanthohumol. == Research == Xanthohumol is under basic research for its potential biological properties. Xanthohumol can be extracted with pressurized hot water. == See also == Isoxanthohumol, the corresponding prenylated flavanone 8-Prenylnaringenin, a related prenylflavanoid with estrogenic activity Alpha acids, a class of bitter compounds in hops Myrcene, humulene, and caryophyllene, essential oils in hops == References ==	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -4.723352e-06, 'OD': 0.0}
123	Climbazole	WIKIPEDIA	Climbazole is a topical antifungal agent commonly used in the treatment of human fungal skin infections such as dandruff, seborrhoeic dermatitis and eczema. Climbazole has shown a high in vitro and in vivo efficacy against Malassezia spp. that appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of dandruff. Its chemical structure and properties are similar to other azole fungicides such as ketoconazole, clotrimazole and miconazole. == Indications and formulations == It is most commonly found as an active ingredient in OTC anti-dandruff and anti-fungal products, including shampoos, lotions and conditioners. It may be accompanied by other active ingredients such as zinc pyrithione or triclosan. == Side effects == It may cause localized irritation of the skin with symptoms including redness, rashes and itching. == References ==	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL	{'PERSON': -0.5272733, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0, ',': -0.030921781, ' MED': -1.147242e-06, 'ICAL': 0.0}
126	Ketoconazole	WIKIPEDIA	Ketoconazole, sold under the brand name Nizoral, among others, is an antiandrogen, antifungal, and antiglucocorticoid medication used to treat a number of fungal infections. Applied to the skin it is used for fungal skin infections such as tinea, cutaneous candidiasis, pityriasis versicolor, dandruff, and seborrheic dermatitis. Taken by mouth it is a less preferred option and only recommended for severe infections when other agents cannot be used. Other uses include treatment of excessive male-patterned hair growth in women and Cushing's syndrome. Common side effects when applied to the skin include redness. Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, headache, and liver problems. Liver problems may result in death or the need for a liver transplantation. Other severe side effects when taken by mouth include QT prolongation, adrenocortical insufficiency, and anaphylaxis. It is an imidazole and works by hindering the production of ergosterol required for the fungal cell membrane, thereby slowing growth. Ketoconazole was patented in 1977 by Belgian pharmaceutical company Janssen, and came into medical use in 1981. It is available as a generic medication and formulations that are applied to the skin are over the counter in the United Kingdom. In 2022, it was the 175th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. The formulation that is taken by mouth was withdrawn in the European Union and in Australia in 2013, and in China in 2015. In addition, its use was restricted in the United States and Canada in 2013. == Medical uses == === Topical antifungal === Topically administered ketoconazole is usually prescribed for fungal infections of the skin and mucous membranes, such as athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis (yeast infection or thrush), jock itch, and tinea versicolor. Topical ketoconazole is also used as a treatment for dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp) and for seborrheic dermatitis on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus Malassezia furfur on the skin. === Systemic antifungal === Ketoconazole has activity against many kinds of fungi that may cause human disease, such as Candida, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and Blastomyces (although it is not active against Aspergillus), chromomycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis. First made in 1977, ketoconazole was the first orally-active azole antifungal medication. However, ketoconazole has largely been replaced as a first-line systemic antifungal medication by other azole antifungal agents, such as fluconazole and/or itraconazole, because of ketoconazole's greater toxicity, poorer absorption, and more limited spectrum of activity. Ketoconazole is used orally in dosages of 200 to 400 mg per day in the treatment of superficial and deep fungal infections. === Off-label uses === ==== Hair loss ==== Ketoconazole shampoo in conjunction with an oral 5α-reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride has been used off label to treat androgenic alopecia. It was speculated that antifungal properties of ketoconazole reduce scalp microflora and consequently may reduce follicular inflammation that contributes to alopecia. Limited clinical studies suggest ketoconazole shampoo used either alone or in combination with other treatments may be useful in reducing hair loss in some cases. ==== Hormonal ==== The side effects of ketoconazole are sometimes harnessed in the treatment of non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol ergosterol in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800 mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several enzymes necessary for the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol. Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which convert pregnenolone into androgens, and 11β-hydroxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. All of these enzymes are mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzymes. Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat hirsutism and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited precocious puberty. In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism. Ketoconazole has been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. == Contraindications == Oral ketoconazole has various contraindications, such as concomitant use with certain other drugs due to known drug interactions. Other contraindications of oral ketoconazole include liver disease, adrenal insufficiency, and known hypersensitivity to oral ketoconazole. == Side effects == === Gastrointestinal === Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, dry mouth, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, flatulence, tongue discoloration may occur. === Endocrine === The drug may cause adrenal insufficiency so the level of the adrenocortical hormones should be monitored while taking it. Oral ketoconazole at a dosage range of 400 to 2,000 mg/day has been found to result in a rate of gynecomastia of 21%. === Liver === In July 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that taking ketoconazole by mouth can cause severe liver injuries and adrenal gland problems: adrenal insufficiency and worsening of other related to the gland conditions. It recommends oral tablets should not be a first-line treatment for any fungal infection. It should be used for the treatment of certain fungal infections, known as endemic mycoses, only when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or not tolerated. As contraindication it should not be used in people with acute or chronic liver disease. === Hypersensitivity === Anaphylaxis after the first dose may occur. Other cases of hypersensitivity include urticaria. === Topical formulations === The topical formulations have not been associated with liver damage, adrenal problems, or drug interactions. These formulations include creams, shampoos, foams, and gels applied to the skin, unlike the ketoconazole tablets, which are taken by mouth. === Pregnancy === Ketoconazole is categorized as pregnancy category C in the US. Research in animals has shown it to cause teratogenesis when administered in high doses. A subsequent trial in Europe failed to show a risk to infants of mothers receiving ketoconazole. == Overdose == In the event of an overdose of oral ketoconazole, treatment should be supportive and based on symptoms. Activated charcoal may be administered within the first hour following overdose of oral ketoconazole. == Interactions == The concomitant use of the following medications is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone irinotecan, lurasidone, colchicine alprazolam, oral midazolam, oral triazolam felodipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin ergot alkaloids: ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, methylergometrine Others: cisapride, nisoldipine, dofetilide, pimozide And is not recommended: carbamazepine, phenytoin gastric acid suppressants: antacids, antimuscarinics, histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors sucralfate rifampin, rifabutin, isoniazid efavirenz, nevirapine Ritonavir is known for increasing activity of the ketoconazole so it is recommended to reduce dosage. There is also a list of drugs which significantly decrease systemic exposure to the ketoconazole and drugs whose systemic exposure is increased by the ketoconazole. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antifungal activity ==== As an antifungal, ketoconazole is structurally similar to imidazole, and interferes with the fungal synthesis of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, as well as certain enzymes. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1). This enzyme participates in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from lanosterol to ergosterol. Lower doses of fluconazole and itraconazole are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, as they have been found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes. Resistance to ketoconazole has been observed in a number of clinical fungal isolates, including Candida albicans. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. Multidrug-resistance (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family. ==== Antihormonal activity ==== As an antiandrogen, ketoconazole operates through at least two mechanisms of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 40 mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading to a reduction in circulating testosterone levels. It produces this effect through inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of steroids, including the precursors of testosterone. Due to its efficacy at reducing systemic androgen levels, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Second, ketoconazole is an androgen receptor antagonist, competing with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to the androgen receptor. This effect is thought to be quite weak however, even with high oral doses of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole, along with miconazole, has been found to act as an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor. Ketoconazole is a racemic mixture consisting of cis-(2S,4R)-(−) and cis-(2R,4S)-(+) enantiomers. The cis-(2S,4R) isomer was more potent in inhibiting progesterone 17α,20-lyase than its enantiomer (IC50 values of 0.05 and 2.38 μM, respectively) and in inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase (IC50 values of 0.152 and 0.608 μM, respectively). Both isomers were relatively weak inhibitors of human placental aromatase. Oral ketoconazole has been used clinically as a steroidogenesis inhibitor in men, women, and children at dosages of 200 to 1,200 mg/day. Numerous small studies have investigated the effects of oral ketoconazole on hormone levels in humans. It has been found in men to significantly decrease testosterone and estradiol levels and to significantly increase luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels, whereas levels of androstenedione, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were unaffected. The ratio of testosterone to estradiol is also decreased during oral ketoconazole therapy in men. Suppression of testosterone levels by ketoconazole is generally partial and has often been found to be transient. Better effects on suppression of testosterone levels have been observed in men when ketoconazole is combined with a GnRH agonist to suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, which prevents compensatory upregulation of luteinizing hormone secretion and consequent activation of gonadal testosterone production. In premenopausal women with polycystic ovary syndrome, ketoconazole has been found to significantly decrease levels of androstenedione and testosterone and significantly increase levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and estradiol. Studies in postmenopausal women with breast cancer have found that ketoconazole significantly decreases androstenedione levels, slightly decreases estradiol levels, and does not affect estrone levels. This indicates minimal inhibition of aromatase by ketoconazole in vivo in humans. Ketoconazole has also been found to decrease levels of endogenous corticosteroids, such as cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone, as well as vitamin D. Ketoconazole has been found to displace dihydrotestosterone and estradiol from sex hormone-binding globulin in vitro, but this was not found to be relevant in vivo. ==== Other activities ==== Ketoconazole has been found to inhibit the activity of the cation channel TRPM5. === Pharmacokinetics === When administered orally, ketoconazole is best absorbed at highly acidic levels, so antacids or other causes of decreased stomach acid levels will lower the drug's absorption. Absorption can be increased by taking it with an acidic beverage, such as cola. Ketoconazole is very lipophilic and tends to accumulate in fatty tissues. == Chemistry == Ketoconazole is a synthetic imidazole. It is a nonsteroidal compound. It is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, levoketoconazole ((2S,4R)-(−)-ketoconazole) and dextroketoconazole ((2R,4S)-(+)-ketoconazole). Levoketoconazole is under development for potential clinical use as a steroidogenesis inhibitor with better tolerability and less toxicity than ketoconazole. Other steroidogenesis inhibitors besides ketoconazole and levoketoconazole include the nonsteroidal compound aminoglutethimide and the steroidal compound abiraterone acetate. == History == Ketoconazole was discovered in 1976 at Janssen Pharmaceuticals. It was patented in 1977, followed by introduction in the United States in July 1981. Following its introduction, ketoconazole was the only systemic antifungal available for almost a decade. Ketoconazole was introduced as the prototypical medication of the imidazole group of antifungals. Oral ketoconazole has been replaced with oral fluconazole or itraconazole for many mycoses. Due to incidence of serious liver toxicity, the use of oral ketoconazole was suspended in France in July 2011, following review. This event triggered an evaluation of oral ketoconazole throughout the rest of the European Union. In 2013, oral ketoconazole was withdrawn in the European Union and Australia, and strict restrictions were placed on the use of oral ketoconazole in the United States and Canada. Oral ketoconazole is indicated for use in these countries when the indication is a severe or life-threatening systemic infection and alternatives are unavailable. However, topical ketoconazole, which does not distribute systemically, is safe and widely used still. Ketoconazole HRA was approved for use in the European Union for treatment of Cushing's syndrome in November 2013. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Ketoconazole is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Ketoconazole has been marketed under a large number of brand names. === Availability === Ketoconazole is available widely throughout the world. In 2013, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that a ban be imposed on the use of oral ketoconazole for systemic use in humans throughout the European Union, after concluding that the risk of serious liver injury from systemic ketoconazole outweighs its benefits. == Research == As of March 2019, oral levoketoconazole (developmental code name COR-003, tentative brand name Recorlev) is phase III clinical trials for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. Oral levoketoconazole may have a lower risk of liver toxicity than oral ketoconazole. == Veterinary use == Ketoconazole is sometimes prescribed as an antifungal by veterinarians for use in pets, often as unflavored tablets that may need to be cut to smaller size for correct dosage. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.0033243417, ' PERSON': -0.000742684, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}
128	Guanosine	WIKIPEDIA	"Guanosine (symbol G or Guo) is a purine nucleoside comprising guanine attached to a ribose (ribofuranose) ring via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. Guanosine can be phosphorylated to become guanosine monophosphate (GMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). These forms play important roles in various biochemical processes such as synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, photosynthesis, muscle contraction, and intracellular signal transduction (cGMP). When guanine is attached by its N9 nitrogen to the C1 carbon of a deoxyribose ring it is known as deoxyguanosine. == Physical and chemical properties == Guanosine is a white, crystalline powder with no odor and mild saline taste. It is very soluble in acetic acid, slightly soluble in water, insoluble in ethanol, diethyl ether, benzene and chloroform. == Functions == Guanosine is required for an RNA splicing reaction in mRNA, when a ""self-splicing"" intron removes itself from the mRNA message by cutting at both ends, re-ligating, and leaving just the exons on either side to be translated into protein. == Uses == The antiviral drug acyclovir, often used in herpes treatment, and the anti-HIV drug abacavir, are structurally similar to guanosine.

131	Pyrantel	WIKIPEDIA	"Pyrantel is a medication used to treat a number of parasitic worm infections. This includes ascariasis, hookworm infections, enterobiasis (pinworm infection), trichostrongyliasis, and trichinellosis. It is taken by mouth. Side effects include nausea, headache, dizziness, trouble sleeping, and rash. A lower dose should be used in people with liver disease. While it does not appear to be harmful during pregnancy, it has not been studied for this use. It is unclear if it is safe for use during breastfeeding. It is in the antihelmintic family of medications. It works by paralyzing worms. Pyrantel was initially described in 1965. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Pyrantel is available as a generic medication. It may also be used to treat worms in a number of other animals. == Pregnancy and breastfeeding == Pyrantel pamoate is considered a pregnancy category C drug for use during pregnancy for humans, but is in category A for canines and felines. Pyrantel is considered safe to use in nursing animals. == Mechanism of action == Pyrantel pamoate acts as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, thereby causing sudden contraction, followed by paralysis, of the helminths. This has the result of causing the worm to ""lose its grip"" on the intestinal wall and be passed out of the system by natural process. Since Pyrantel is poorly absorbed by the host's intestine, the host is unaffected by the small dosage of medication used. Spastic (tetanic) paralyzing agents, in particular pyrantel pamoate, may induce complete intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. This obstruction is usually in the form of a worm impaction and happens when a very small, but heavily parasitized animal is treated and tries to pass a large number of dislodged worms at once. Worms usually pass in normal stool or with diarrhea, straining, and occasional vomiting. == Names == There are a number of brands, including ""Reese's Pinworm Medicine"", ""Pin-X"", ""Pin-Rid"", ""PYRANTRIN"", ""COMBANTRIN"", ""Anthel"", ""Helmintox"", ""Helmex"", ""Strongid"" and Drontal Cat. == References == == External links == ""Pyrantel"".

141	Desvenlafaxine	WIKIPEDIA	"Desvenlafaxine, sold under the brand name Pristiq among others, is a medication used to treat depression. It is an antidepressant of the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class and is taken by mouth. It is recommended that the need for further treatment be occasionally reassessed. It may be less effective than its parent compound venlafaxine, although some studies have found comparable efficacy. Common side effects include dizziness, trouble sleeping, increased sweating, constipation, sleepiness, anxiety, and sexual problems. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, bleeding, mania, and high blood pressure. There is a high risk of withdrawal syndrome which may occur if the dose is decreased or the medication is completely stopped. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Desvenlafaxine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2008. In Europe its application for use was denied in 2009. In 2022, it was the 208th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Desvenlafaxine is primarily used as a treatment for major depressive disorder. Use has only been studied up to 8 weeks. It may be less effective than venlafaxine, although some studies have found comparable efficacy with a lower rate of nausea. Doses of 50 to 400 mg/day appear effective for major depressive disorder, although no additional benefit was demonstrated at doses greater than 50 mg/day, and adverse events and discontinuations were more frequent at higher doses. Desvenlafaxine improves the HAM-D17 score and measures of well-being such as the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). == Adverse effects == Frequency of adverse effects: Very common adverse effects include: Common adverse effects include: Uncommon adverse effects include: Rare adverse effects include: Common adverse effects whose intensity is unknown include: == Pharmacology == Desvenlafaxine is a synthetic form of the isolated major active metabolite of venlafaxine, and is categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). When most normal metabolizers take venlafaxine, approximately 70% of the dose is metabolized into desvenlafaxine, so the effects of the two drugs are expected to be very similar. It works by blocking the ""reuptake"" transporters for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It is approximately 10 times more potent at inhibiting serotonin uptake than norepinephrine uptake. == Approval status == === United States === Wyeth announced on 23 January 2007 that it received an approvable letter from the Food and Drug Administration for desvenlafaxine. Final approval to sell the drug was contingent on a number of things, including: A satisfactory FDA inspection of Wyeth's Guayama, Puerto Rico facility, where the drug is to be manufactured; Several postmarketing surveillance commitments, and follow-up studies on low-dose use, relapse, and use in children; Clarity by Wyeth around the company's product education plan for physicians and patients; Approval of desvenlafaxine's proprietary name, Pristiq. The FDA approved the drug for antidepressant use in February 2008, and was to be available in US pharmacies in May 2008. In March 2017, the generic form of the drug was made available in the US. === Canada === On February 4, 2009, Health Canada approved use of desvenlafaxine for treatment of depression. === European Union === In 2009, an application to market desvenlafaxine for major depressive disorder in the European Union was declined. In 2012, Pfizer received authorization in Spain to market desvenlafaxine for the disorder. In August 2022, following a 14-year approval process, desvenlafaxine was brought to the market for the disorder in Germany. === Australia === Desvenlafaxine is classified as a schedule 4 (prescription only) drug in Australia.

144	Chelidonine	WIKIPEDIA	"Chelidonine is an isolate of Papaveraceae with acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. == Introduction == Chelidonine is the major alkaloid component of Chelidonium majus. Chelidonium majus L. is the only species of the tribe Chelidonieae of the family Papaveraceae. Papaveraceae is rich in specific alkaloids. C. majus contains various isoquinoline alkaloids with protopine, protoberberine and benzophenanthridine structures. This benzophenanthridine alkaloid can induce apoptosis in some transformed or malignant cell lines. D-Chelidonine, the main alkaloid of Chelidonium majus, was first isolated in 1839. The supposed healing properties of greater celandine (Chelidonium majus) were believed in throughout Europe and Asia during the Imperial Roman period (Pliny 1966), and New World aboriginal cultures used BIA-containing plants by using sap or root extracts to treat minor cuts and infections. == Synthesis == The amide (N-(bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1,3,5-trien-7-yl)-2-ethenylbenzamide) was heated in boiling bromobenzene to form the transfused compound. By contrast, thermolysis of the more flexible urethane (methyl bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1,3,5-trien-7-yl[(2-ethenylphenyl)methyl]carbamate) afforded the desired cis fused product. The building blocks required for the synthesis of chelidonine are urethane and benzyl bromide. The urethane was obtained by first using the nitrile (5,6-dihydro-2H-cyclobuta[f][1,3]benzodioxole-5-carbonitrile), duo to hydrolysis carboxylic acid was generated. The carboxylic acid which on Curtius degradation yielded crude isocyanate (N=C=O). The reaction of crude isocyanate with benzyl alcohol made the urethane, with the NHCOOC7H7 side group. The benzyl bromide was obtained by the conversion of 2,3-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde to 1,2,3,4 - tetrahydro-7,8-methylenedioxyisoquinol by the successive Hofmann and von Braun degradations. Condensation of urethane and benzyl bromide led to the formation of the oily styrene. From this structure the liquid acetylene was formed. Next, the crystalline tetrahydrobenz[c]phenanthridine was formed. hydroboration and oxidation produced an alcohol. Jones oxidation gave rise to the ketone. And by processing the ketone the desired cis,cis-alcohol was formed. After hydrogenolysis of the benzyloxycarbonyl group, dl-norchelidonine was synthesized. == Available forms == Chelidonine has a few forms which are synthesized in a similar way and which are structurally alike, including: (+)-homochelidonine, (+)-chelamine and (−)-norchelidonine are tertiary benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids with partially hydrogenated B and C rings. They occur in a number of plant species of the family Papaveraceae. The first two have been isolated from the roots of Chelidonium majus L. as minor alkaloids. Enantiomeric (+)-norchelidonine has been recently found in C. majus. == Metabolism == Chelidonine is a major bioactive, isoquinoline alkaloid ingredient in Chelidonium majus. Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) are a structurally diverse group of plant specialized metabolites with a long history of investigation. A restricted number of enzyme families have been implicated in BIA metabolism. Whereas some enzymes exhibit a relatively broad substrate range, others are highly substrate specific. A small number of plant species, including opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and other members of the Ranunculales, have emerged as model systems to study BIA metabolism. Recently, the emergence of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics has expedited the discovery of new BIA biosynthetic genes. In general, methyltransferases of BIA metabolism accept a wide variety of alkaloid substrates with diverse backbone structures, with some showing more flexibility than others with respect to substrate range. == Indications == Chelidonine is an isolate of Papaveraceae with acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (a nonspecific cholinesterase) inhibitory activity. AChE (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitors or anti-cholinesterases inhibit the enzyme cholinesterase from breaking down ACh, increasing both the level and duration of the neurotransmitter action. According to the mode of action, AChE inhibitors can be divided into two groups: irreversible and reversible. Reversible inhibitors, competitive or noncompetitive, mostly have therapeutic applications, while toxic effects are associated with irreversible AChE activity modulators. Reversible AChE inhibitors play an important role in pharmacological manipulation of the enzyme activity. These inhibitors include compounds with different functional groups (carbamate, quaternary or tertiary ammonium group), and have been applied in the diagnostic and/or treatment of various diseases such as: myasthenia gravis, AD, post-operative ileus, bladder distention, glaucoma, as well as antidote to anticholinergic overdose. == Toxicity == Chelidonine has been studied in multiple organisms, but mainly in rats and mice. In these organisms, sublethal doses of chelidonine caused ptosis tremor, sedation, and a decrease in body temperature. The LD50 of chelidonine, intraperitoneally administered, is in mice 1.3 g/kg and in rats 2 g/kg. There are not many studies of toxicity of chelidonine in humans. == References == Cahlíková, Lucie; Opletal, Lubomír; Kurfürst, Milan; Macáková, Katerina; Kulhánková, Andrea; Hostálková, Anna (2010).

147	Sulfadimethoxine	WIKIPEDIA	"Sulfadimethoxine (or sulphadimethoxine, trade names Di-Methox or Albon) is a long-lasting sulfonamide antimicrobial medication used in veterinary medicine. It is used to treat many infections, including respiratory, urinary tract, enteric, and soft tissue infections and can be given as a standalone or combined with ormetoprim to broaden the target range. Like all sulfamides, sulfadimethoxine inhibits bacterial synthesis of folic acid by acting as a competitive inhibitor against PABA. It is the most common drug prescribed to dogs who have coccidiosis. == Mechanism == Like other sulfonamides, sulfadimethoxine is a dihydropteroate synthase inhibitor. Bacteria and some protozoa are unable to obtain folic acid from the environment, and must instead synthesize it by converting PABA (para-aminobenzoate) to dihydropteroate using the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. Sulfonamides act as a competitive inhibitor; being structurally similar to PABA, they are able to bind to the enzyme's active site and prevent the synthesis of folic acid from progressing. Folic acid is necessary for these organisms to produce nucleic acids (i.e. DNA and RNA), which are required for cell division. Thus, it has a microbiostatic effect rather than a microbiocidal one (it prevents pathogen growth rather than killing them), and has the strongest effect in the beginning stages of an infection, when the pathogen is rapidly dividing. Since it is microbiostatic, sulfadimethoxine still requires the animal to still be able to mount an immune response to kill the pathogen. === With ormetoprim === Sulfadimethoxine can either be given alone (such as under the commercial name Albon) or in combination with ormetoprim to as a ""potentiated sulfonamide"" to increase antimicrobial activity. Ormetoprim is a diaminopyridine, inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, which is further along the pathway for synthesizing folic acid. Though the optimum ratio of sulfadimethoxine to ormetoprim has been found to be 20:1, it is sold pharmaceutically as a 5:1 mixture. == Pharmacokinetics == Sulfadimethoxine, like all sulfonamides, diffuses easily when it is in its unionized, lipid-soluble form, and easily reaches many tissues. The relative amounts are determined by both its pKa and by the pH of each tissue. Therefore, levels tend to be higher in less acidic tissue and body fluids or in diseased tissues having high concentrations of leucocytes. Its ability to bind to plasma proteins is very high, leading sulfadimethoxine to maintain higher blood levels than most other long-acting sulfonamides. Comparatively low doses can give rapid and sustained therapeutic blood levels. Most animals for which sulfadimethoxine is marketed acetylate sulfadimethoxine in the liver to form acetylsulfadimethoxine, which is secreted in the bile. Dogs are the exception – since they are unable acetylate sulfonamides, they excrete sulfadimethoxine mostly unchanged in the urine (their inability to transform sulfadimethoxine also makes them more susceptible to negative side effects). Sulfadimethoxine has a relatively high solubility at the pH normally occurring in the kidneys, and is easily reabsorbed into the renal tubules, adding to its long half-life. The use of sulfadimethoxine raises concerns that it will precipitate in the kidneys, leading to crystalluria. Though crystallization is not actually a common occurrence in veterinary medicine, it can be avoided entirely by adding a diaminopyrimidine such as ormetoprim. Having the animal stay well-hydrated also is advised. == Use & Dosage == Sulfadimethoxine is the only FDA-approved drug for treating intestinal coccidioisis in cats and dogs. It is also used for: Treating skin and soft-tissue infections in dogs caused by Staphylococcus aureus or E. coli Treating cattle for bovine respiratory disease complex (""shipping fever complex""), necrotic pododermatitis (foot rot), pneumonia when caused by Pasteurella, and calf diphtheria caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum When combined with ormetoprim: Treating soft tissue infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, and intestinal coccidia infections in dogs Prevention of fowl cholera and coccidioisis by Eimeria in poultry Treating salmon and trout for furunculosis It is also one of the only sulfonamides allowed for treating lactating dairy cattle (the others being sulfabromethazine and sulfathoxypyridazine). The proper dosage of sulfadimethoxine depends on the animal species, the medical condition being treated, and the specific formulation of the medication. Using a tool like Sulfadimethoxine dosage calculator is important to determine the right dosage based on the animal's weight and species. == Notes == This article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine (ALBON sulfadimethoxine suspension), which is in the public domain."

156	Isolithocholic acid	PUBMED	 Bile acids are relevant markers for clinical research. This study reports the production of antibodies for isolithocholic acid, the isomer of the extensively studied lithocholic acid. The IgG titer and affinity maturation were monitored during the immunizations of three mice and two rabbits. In both animal models, polyclonal antibodies with a high selectivity and affinity were produced. The development of a direct competitive ELISA with a test midpoint of 0.69 ± 0.05 μ g/L and a measurement range from 0.09-15 μg/L is reported. Additionally, the crystal structure of isolithocholic acid is described for the first time. Bile acids are promising chemical markers to assess the pollution of water samples with fecal material. This study describes the optimization and validation of a direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the bile acid isolithocholic acid (ILA). The quantification range of the optimized assay was between 0.09 and 15 μg/L. The assay was applied to environmental water samples. Most studies until now were focused on bile acid fractions in the particulate phase of water samples. In order to avoid tedious sample preparation, we undertook to evaluate the dynamics and significance of ILA levels in the aqueous phase. Very low concentrations in tap and surface water samples made a pre-concentration step necessary for this matrix as well as for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. Mean recoveries for spiked water samples were between 97% and 109% for tap water and WWTP influent samples and between 102% and 136% for WWTP effluent samples. 90th percentiles of intra-plate and inter-plate coefficients of variation were below 10% for influents and below 20% for effluents and surface water. ILA concentrations were quantified in the range of 33-72 μg/L in influent, 21-49 ng/L in effluent and 18-48 ng/L in surface water samples. During wastewater treatment the ILA levels were reduced by more than 99%. ILA concentrations of influents determined by ELISA and LC-MS/MS were in good agreement. However, findings in LC-ELISA experiments suggest that the true ILA levels in concentrated samples are lower due to interfering effects of matrix compounds and/or cross-reactants. Yet, the ELISA will be a valuable tool for the performance check and comparison of WWTPs and the localization of fecal matter input into surface waters.

159	N(4)-acetylsulfadimethoxine	PUBMED	 A simple and rapid method was developed for the simultaneous extraction and liquid chromatographic (LC) determination of sulfadimethoxine (SDM) and 4-N-acetylsulfadimethoxine (N-acetyl SDM) in channel catfish muscle and plasma. Tissues fortified at 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 1000 ppb were examined. Matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) was used for muscle extraction. Plasma was extracted with a modified MSPD procedure in which 100 microL plasma and 400 mg C18 were blended by Vortex mixing in a disposable chromatographic column. Recovery of SDM based on radioactivity was 79% for muscle and 67% for plasma. Standard curves based on extracted fortified samples were used for quantitation of N-acetyl SDM. LC run times of 12 min were obtained using a microbore analytical column and an isocratic mobile phase of aqueous 0.017M phosphoric acid-acetonitrile at ratios of 71:29 for muscle and 73:27 for plasma extracts. Method detection limits were 26 ng SDM and 26 ng N-acetyl SDM/g muscle, and 33 ng SDM and 11 ng N-acetyl SDM/mL plasma. Intra-assay variation was < 10% for both compounds at all concentrations examined. Inter-assay variation for SDM was 13% for muscle and 14% for plasma, and for N-acetyl SDM was 11% for muscle and 10% for plasma. A quantitative method was developed and validated to measure the concentration of sulfadimethoxine (SDM) and its major metabolite, (4)N-acetylsulfadimethoxine (AcSDM), in bovine tissues and body fluids. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) gave quantitative results for these two analytes in extracts from bovine plasma, urine, oral fluid, kidney, and liver, using SDM-d(4) as internal standard (I.S.). The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for both analytes in these matrices was validated at 2, 100, and 5 ng/mL in plasma, urine, and oral fluid respectively, and 10 ng/g in both kidney (cortex) and liver. The overall accuracy (average of 4 levels) is, for plasma, 104% (SDM) and 95% (AcSDM), with standard deviation of 9% (SDM) and 15% (AcSDM); for urine, 100% (SDM) and 106% (AcSDM), with standard deviation of 5% (SDM) and 6% (AcSDM); for oral fluid, 103% (SDM) and 103% (AcSDM), with standard deviation of 4% (SDM) and 4% (AcSDM); for kidney, 101% (SDM) and 111% (AcSDM), with standard deviation of 7% (SDM) and 6% (AcSDM); and for liver, 99% (SDM) and 115% (AcSDM), with standard deviation of 11% (SDM) and 9% (AcSDM). C18 SPE cartridges were used to clean-up these matrices, except for urine which was diluted directly with buffer before analysis by LC/MS/MS. In order to gain an understanding of protein binding of sulfadimethoxine (SDM) and its major metabolite, N4-acetylsulfadimethoxine (N4-AcSDM), the binding of SDM and N4-AcSDM to human and rabbit serum albumin (HSA and RSA) was investigated using circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence and dialysis techniques. The CD spectral characteristics of the compounds bound to the albumins suggested that the drug-binding sites on the HSA and RSA had somewhat different asymmetries. The binding constants for SDM-HSA and -RSA interaction were smaller than those for N4-AcSDM. Two specific drug-binding sites were found on RSA, similarly to HSA, from the results of competitive displacement using fluorescence probes. Moreover, SDM and N4-AcSDM were found to share the same first binding site on the albumins. It can be presumed from the displacement data with a series of p-aminobenzoates that the characteristics of the binding sites (such as depth and width of the hydrophobic cleft) for SDM and N4-AcSDM on RSA may be almost the same, but the characteristics of these drug-binding sites on HSA may be somewhat different.

160	Xylometazoline	WIKIPEDIA	"Xylometazoline, also spelled xylomethazoline, is a medication used to reduce symptoms of nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis. It is used directly in the nose as a spray or drops. Side effects include trouble sleeping, irritation of the nose, nausea, nosebleed (3%), period pain (10%) and headache (3%). Long term use (> 10 days) is not recommended due to a rhinitis medicamentosa when stopped. Use is not recommended during pregnancy. Xylometazoline is in the decongestant and alpha-adrenergic agonist families of medication. One study classified it with selectivity ratios in alpha 2 adrenergic receptors of 151 for a2A vs a2B, 4.5 a2A vs a2C, and 33.9 a2B vs a2C. Making it a highly selective a2A agonist. Xylometazoline was patented in 1956 and came into medical use in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Xylometazoline is available as a generic medication. == Mechanism of action == Xylometazoline works by stimulating adrenergic receptors on the lamina propria of blood vessels in the nose. The decongestant effect is due to constriction of large veins in the nose which swell up during the inflammation of any infection or allergy of the nose. The smaller arteries are also constricted and this causes the colour of the nasal epithelium to be visibly paler after dosage. Xylometazoline is an imidazole derivative which is designed to mimic the molecular shape of adrenaline. It binds to α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa. Due to its sympathomimetic effects, it should not be used by people with high blood pressure, or other heart problems. Extended usage of xylometazoline can result in decreased effectiveness or a buildup of tolerance against the drug. The number of receptors decreases, and when the administration of the drug is ceased, chronic congestion can occur; this is called rhinitis medicamentosa, commonly referred to as rebound congestion. Moreover, long-term overdosing can cause degenerative changes in nasal mucous membranes that pose another health problem. == Society and culture == In 2021, a US FDA Drug Safety Communication stated that, while a US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) proposed rule regarding child-resistant packaging covered products containing xylometazoline, no such products were marketed in the United States at that time. === Brand names === The most common name for over-the-counter products containing xylometazoline internationally is ""Otrivin"" (used in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Jordan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Egypt, Sweden, Vietnam, Hong Kong), ""Otrivine"" (United Kingdom, Ireland, Turkey, Belgium), or ""Otriven"" (Germany). A product marketed as ""Otrivin Oxy"" contains oxymetazoline instead of xylometazoline. Other product names used include Antazol (Square, in Bangladesh), Xylomet (Opsonin, Bangladesh), Cirovin, Klarigen (in Denmark), Nasolin (in Finland), Neo-Rinoleina, Novorin, Olynth, Otrinoz, Galazolin (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus), Nasomist-X, Otrix, Rhinoset, Zenfresh, Naphthyzinium, Xymelyn (in Latvia), Sinutab Nasal Spray, Snup akut, Sudafed, Xylo-COMOD, Xylolin (in the United Arab Emirates), Xylovit, Olynth (in Serbia, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Slovakia), Meralys (in Croatia) Xynosine (in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan), Xymelin, Zymelin, Xylostar, Xylorin (in Poland), Nasobol, Xylo Mepha and others (Switzerland), Decozal (in Jordan), Nasic, Orinox (Romania), Narhimed (Italy), nasa Rhinathiol (Belgium), Zolinol, Nasorhinathiol, and Vibrocil (Portugal). === Formulations === The standard adult solution strength is 0.1% w/v xylometazoline (or 1 mg per 1 mL solution). == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
164	Tripelennamine	WIKIPEDIA	Tripelennamine, sold under the brand name Pyribenzamine by Novartis, is a drug that is used as an antipruritic and first-generation antihistamine. It can be used in the treatment of asthma, hay fever, rhinitis, and urticaria, but is now less common as it has been replaced by newer antihistamines. The drug was patented at CIBA, which merged with Geigy into Ciba-Geigy, and eventually becoming Novartis. == Medical uses == Where and when it is/was in common use, tripelennamine is used much like other mildly-anticholinergic antihistamines to treat conditions of the upper respiratory tract arising from illnesses and hay fever. It can be used alone or in combination with other agents to have the desired effect. Cough medicines of the general formula tripelennamine + codeine/dihydrocodine/hydrocodone ± expectorant ± decongestant(s) are popular where available. Among these are the Pyribenzamine cough syrups which contain codeine, with and without decongestants, listed in the 1978 Physicians' Desk Reference; the codeine-tripelennamine synergy is well-known and makes such mixtures more useful for their intended purposes. == Side effects == Tripelennamine is mildly sedating. Other side effects can include irritation, dry mouth, nausea, and dizziness. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tripelennamine acts primarily as an antihistamine, or H1 receptor antagonist. It has little to no anticholinergic activity, with 180-fold selectivity for the H1 receptor over the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (for comparison, diphenhydramine had 20-fold selectivity for the H1 receptor). In addition to its antihistamine properties, tripelennamine also acts as a weak serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). === Pharmacokinetics === The elimination half-life of tripelennamine is 4 to 6 hours. In a clinical study, the half-life of tripelennamine following intramuscular injection of 50 to 100 mg was 2.9 to 4.4 hours. == History == Tripelennamine was patented in 1946 by Carl Djerassi and colleagues, working at CIBA in New Jersey. == Society and culture == === Availability === Tripelennamine is no longer available in the United States. == See also == Chloropyramine Mepyramine Pheniramine Pentazocine == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -3.6669935e-05, 'ICAL': 0.0}
165	Dibenzylamine	PUBMED	 Chemiophoretic nano- and micromotors require a constant flow of product molecules to maintain a gradient that enables their propulsion. Apart from a smaller number of redox reactions that have been used, catalytic reactions are the main source of energy with the obvious benefit of making on-board fuel storage obsolete. However, the decomposition of H 1. The properties of the rabbit liver microsomal enzyme system(s) catalysing the formation of N,N-dibenzylhydroxylamine as the major metabolite of dibenzylamine have been investigated. 2. The system consists of NADPH- and NADH-dependent components which are differentiated by their different pH optima and sensitivity towards cyanide. 3. The effect of various metabolic inhibitors on the N-oxidation process in vitro are investigated. 4. The N-oxidation of the parent amine was inhibited by CO, SKF 525-A, and inhibitors known to interact with microsomal cytochrome P-450. Phenobarbitone pre-treatment stimulates further metabolism of the hydroxylamine. To investigate whether ketone bodies are directly anticonvulsant. We tested the effects of acetoacetate (ACA), acetone, and both stereoisomers, D-(-)- and L-(+), of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on sensory-evoked seizures in Frings audiogenic seizure-susceptible mice. We found that these ketone bodies, with the exception of the D-(-)-isomer of BHB, were anticonvulsant in this model. Furthermore, with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we confirmed that the activity of L-(+)-BHB was due to dibenzylamine, a chemical contaminant. Our data indicate that the anticonvulsant efficacy of the ketogenic diet may be due in part to the direct actions of ACA and acetone.

166	N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine	PUBMED	 N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine (P Substituted phenylamine antioxidants (SPAs) are used in Canadian industrial processes. SPAs, specifically N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (PNA), have received very little attention despite their current use in Canada and their expected aquatic and environmental releases. There is a research gap regarding the effects of PNA in wildlife; therefore, Chelydra serpentina (common snapping turtle) was studied due to its importance as an environmental indicator species. A chronic experiment was performed using PNA spiked food (0 to 3446 ng/g) to determine its toxicity to juvenile C. serpentina. A significant increase in cyp1a mRNA level was observed in the liver of turtles exposed to 3446 ng/g PNA, suggesting that phase I detoxification is activated in the exposed animals. Additionally, a significant decrease in cyp2b transcript level was observed at the two lowest PNA doses, likely indicating another metabolic alteration for PNA. This study helped determine the molecular effects associated with a PNA exposure in reptiles. Polysorbates are among the most used surfactants in biopharmaceutical products containing proteins. Our work aims to develop a high-throughput fluorometric assay to further diversify the analytical toolbox for quantification of PSs. The assay leverages the micelle activated fluorescence signal from N-Phenyl-1-Naphthylamine (NPN). The development and optimization of assay parameters were guided by the pre-defined analytical target profile. Furthermore, NMR was used to probe the interaction between protein, PS80 and NPN in the measurement system and understand protein interference. All assay parameters including excitation and emission wavelengths, standard curve, NPN concentration, and incubation time have been optimized and adapted to a microplate format, making it compatible with automated solutions that will be pursued in the near future to drive consistency and efficiency in our workflows. The specificity, accuracy, and precision of the assay have been demonstrated through a case study. Furthermore, NMR results provided additional insight into the change of the interaction dynamics between PS80 and NPN as the protein concentration increases. The results indicate minimal interaction between the protein and PS80 at lower concentration. However, when the concentration exceeds 75 mg/mL, there is a significant interaction between the protein and PS-80 micelle and monomer. A high-throughput fluorometric assay has been developed for quantification of polysorbates in biopharmaceutical samples including in-process samples, drug substance and drug product. The assay reported herein could serve as a powerful analytical tool for polysorbate quantification and control, complementing the widely used liquid chromatography with charged aerosol detection method.

171	Clioquinol	WIKIPEDIA	Clioquinol (iodochlorhydroxyquin) tradename Entero-Vioform is an antifungal drug and antiprotozoal drug. It is neurotoxic in large doses. It is a member of a family of drugs called hydroxyquinolines which inhibit certain enzymes related to DNA replication. The drugs have been found to have activity against both viral and protozoal infections. == Antiprotozoal use == A 1964 report described the use of clioquinol in both the treatment and prevention of shigella infection and Entamoeba histolytica infection in institutionalized individuals at Sonoma State Hospital in California. The report indicates 4000 individuals were treated over a 4-year period with few side effects. Several recently reported journal articles describing its use as an antiprotozoal include: A 2005 reference to its use in treating a Dutch family for Entamoeba histolytica infection. A 2004 reference to its use in the Netherlands in the treatment of Dientamoeba fragilis infection. A 1979 reference to the use in Zaire in the treatment of Entamoeba histolytica infection. == Subacute myelo-optic neuropathy == Clioquinol's use as an antiprotozoal drug has been restricted or discontinued in some countries due to an event in Japan where over 10,000 people developed subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) between 1957 and 1970. The drug was used widely in many countries before and after the SMON event without similar reports. As yet, no explanation exists as to why it produced this reaction, and some researchers have questioned whether clioquinol was the causative agent in the disease, noting that the drug had been used for 20 years prior to the epidemic without incident, and that the SMON cases began to reduce in number prior to the discontinuation of the drug. Theories suggested have included improper dosing, the permitted use of the drug for extended periods of time, and dosing which did not consider the smaller average stature of Japanese; however a dose dependent relationship between SMON development and clioquinol use was never found, suggesting the interaction of another compound. Researchers have also suggested the SMON epidemic could have been due to a viral infection with an Inoue-Melnick virus. == Topical use == Clioquinol is a constituent of the prescription medicine Vioform, which is a topical antifungal treatment. It is also used in the form of a cream (and in combination with betamethasone or fluocinolone) in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders. == Potential use as a preventive or treatment in prostate cancer == It has long been recognized that normal prostate cells have high zinc content through ZIP1 mediated uptake, and have low respiration (OXPHOS ATP generation is diverted to citrate export for sperm energetics). Prostate cancer cells have downregulated ZIP1 transporters which leads to greater ATP generation which is diverted to cancer proliferation, an example of a normal-like metabolic phenotype instead being malignant. The zinc ionophore clioquinol was shown in mice to restore zinc levels and stop the growth of prostate tumors. == Use in neurodegenerative diseases == Research at UCSF indicates that clioquinol appears to block the genetic action of Huntington's disease in mice and in cell culture. Recent animal studies have shown that clioquinol can reverse the progression of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. According to Siegfried Hekimi and colleagues at McGill's Department of Biology, clioquinol acts directly on a protein called Clk-1, often informally called “clock-1,” and might slow down the aging process. They theorize that this may explain the apparent ability of the drug to be effective in the above conditions, but warn against individuals experimenting with this drug. In addition, a study performed in Drosophila demonstrates that clioquinol can slow the pathogenesis of tauopathy model by removing the excessive zinc in the cell. == Continued use and manufacture around the world == == See also == PBT2, a related 8-hydroxyquinoline Ionophore, other ionophores == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
174	Apoptosis activator 2	PUBMED	 Gastric cancer is the second most common causes of cancer related death in the world and is responsible for two third of cancer related death in the developing countries. survival rate surgery is low and radiation therapy and chemotherapy as alternatives ways for treatment of gastric cancer are not very promising. Thus there is an urgent need for introducing novel treatment procedures and promising new anti-canceric drugs. In this study we used pre-prepared liposomes and after necessary manipulations ,these modified liposomes were used for delivery of apoptosis activator 2 to gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (AGS). we used pre-prepared liposomes and after necessary manipulations, these modified liposomes were used for delivery of apoptosis activator 2 to AGS cells and induced apoptosis was evaluated by related apoptotic DNA ladder, TUNNEL and Cell Death experiments.

175	Asperphenamate	PUBMED	 A series of novel asperphenamate derivatives were designed and synthesized, including series I (the A-phenyl group replaced with various aromatic heterocycles) and series II (the acyl group substituted by sulfonyl group). All compounds have been screened for their antiproliferative activity in vitro against MCF-7, HeLa, and BEL-7402 cell lines by the standard MTT method. Structure-activity relationship studies displayed the heterocycle type played an important role in activity. Six-membered ring derivatives displayed more potency than five-membered ring and the sulfonyl group in A-ring region made an important contribution to activity. Among all derivatives, tosyl derivative 8c exhibited the greatest potency in three human cancer cell lines. Especially in MCF-7 cells, the cellular potency of 8c was approximately 3.0-fold more potent than that of cisplatin. Firstly, the mechanism of cell death induced by 8c in MCF-7 cells was investigated. The results showed that the cell death was induced by autophagy instead of apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. Further studies indicated that 8c might induce autophagic cell death in HeLa and BEL-7402 cell lines. Amino acid esters are a group of structurally diverse natural products with distinct activities. Some are synthesized through an inter-molecular esterification step catalysed by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). In bacteria, the formation of the intra-molecular ester bond is usually catalysed by a thioesterase domain of NRPS. However, the mechanism by which fungal NRPSs perform this process remains unclear.

176	Phenylalanine	WIKIPEDIA	"Phenylalanine (symbol Phe or F) is an essential α-amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2. It can be viewed as a benzyl group substituted for the methyl group of alanine, or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This essential amino acid is classified as neutral, and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. The L-isomer is used to biochemically form proteins coded for by DNA. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the biological pigment melanin. It is encoded by the messenger RNA codons UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is found naturally in the milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement as it is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenethylamine. As an essential amino acid, phenylalanine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine-containing proteins. The one-letter symbol F was assigned to phenylalanine for its phonetic similarity. == History == The first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the empirical formula, C9H11NO2, in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) seedlings. In 1882, Erlenmeyer and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia. The genetic codon for phenylalanine was first discovered by J. Heinrich Matthaei and Marshall W. Nirenberg in 1961. They showed that by using mRNA to insert multiple uracil repeats into the genome of the bacterium E. coli, they could cause the bacterium to produce a polypeptide consisting solely of repeated phenylalanine amino acids. This discovery helped to establish the nature of the coding relationship that links information stored in genomic nucleic acid with protein expression in the living cell. == Dietary sources == Good sources of phenylalanine are eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, and soybeans. Another common source of phenylalanine is anything sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame, such as diet drinks, diet foods and medication; the metabolism of aspartame produces phenylalanine as one of the compound's metabolites. == Dietary recommendations == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For phenylalanine plus tyrosine, for adults 19 years and older, 33 mg/kg body weight/day. In 2005 the DRI is set to 27 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine), the FAO/WHO/UNU recommendation of 2007 is 25 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine). == Other biological roles == L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids. L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier. In excessive quantities, supplementation can interfere with the production of serotonin and other aromatic amino acids as well as nitric oxide due to the overuse (eventually, limited availability) of the associated cofactors, iron or tetrahydrobiopterin. The corresponding enzymes for those compounds are the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family and nitric oxide synthase. === In plants === Phenylalanine is the starting compound used in the synthesis of flavonoids. Lignan is derived from phenylalanine and from tyrosine. Phenylalanine is converted to cinnamic acid by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. == Biosynthesis == Phenylalanine is biosynthesized via the shikimate pathway. == Phenylketonuria == The genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) is the inability to metabolize phenylalanine because of a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Individuals with this disorder are known as ""phenylketonurics"" and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood. Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and μmol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 μmol/L. A (rare) ""variant form"" of phenylketonuria called hyperphenylalaninemia is caused by the inability to synthesize a cofactor called tetrahydrobiopterin, which can be supplemented. Pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninemia may show similar symptoms of the disorder (high levels of phenylalanine in blood), but these indicators will usually disappear at the end of gestation. Pregnant women with PKU must control their blood phenylalanine levels even if the fetus is heterozygous for the defective gene because the fetus could be adversely affected due to hepatic immaturity. A non-food source of phenylalanine is the artificial sweetener aspartame. This compound is metabolized by the body into several chemical byproducts including phenylalanine. The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: ""Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine."" In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer to the presence of ""aspartame or E951"" and they must be labeled with a warning ""Contains a source of phenylalanine."" In Brazil, the label ""Contém Fenilalanina"" (Portuguese for ""Contains Phenylalanine"") is also mandatory in products which contain it. These warnings are placed to help individuals avoid such foods. == D-, L- and DL-phenylalanine == The stereoisomer D-phenylalanine (DPA) can be produced by conventional organic synthesis, either as a single enantiomer or as a component of the racemic mixture. It does not participate in protein biosynthesis although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been processed. The biological functions of D-amino acids remain unclear, although D-phenylalanine has pharmacological activity at niacin receptor 2. DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is marketed as a nutritional supplement for its purported analgesic and antidepressant activities, which have been supported by clinical trials. DL-Phenylalanine is a mixture of D-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of DL-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by D-phenylalanine of enkephalin degradation by the enzyme carboxypeptidase A. Enkephalins act as agonists of the mu and delta opioid receptors, and agonists of these receptors are known to produce antidepressant effects. The mechanism of DL-phenylalanine's supposed antidepressant activity may also be accounted for in part by the precursor role of L-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, though clinical trials have not found an antidepressant effect from L-phenylalanine alone. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect. D-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the portal circulation. A small amount of D-phenylalanine appears to be converted to L-phenylalanine. D-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the systemic circulation. It appears to cross the blood–brain barrier less efficiently than L-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of D-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine without penetrating the central nervous system. L-Phenylalanine is an antagonist at α2δ Ca2+ calcium channels with a Ki of 980 nM. In the brain, L-phenylalanine is a competitive antagonist at the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor and at the glutamate binding site of AMPA receptor. At the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor L-phenylalanine has an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of 573 μM estimated by Schild regression which is considerably lower than brain L-phenylalanine concentration observed in untreated human phenylketonuria. L-Phenylalanine also inhibits neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex with IC50 of 980 μM, a brain concentration seen in classical phenylketonuria, whereas D-phenylalanine has a significantly smaller effect. == Commercial synthesis == L-Phenylalanine is produced for medical, feed, and nutritional applications, such as aspartame, in large quantities by utilizing the bacterium Escherichia coli, which naturally produces aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine. The quantity of L-phenylalanine produced commercially has been increased by genetically engineering E. coli, such as by altering the regulatory promoters or amplifying the number of genes controlling enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the amino acid. == Derivatives == Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, used in neutron capture therapy. 4-Azido-L-phenylalanine is a protein-incorporated unnatural amino acid used as a tool for bioconjugation in the field of chemical biology. == References == == External links == Phenylalanine mass spectrum Phenylalanine at ChemSynthesis"	MEDICAL, FOOD	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	{'END': -0.013223758, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -0.05335377, ' FOOD': -0.00033522744, ' MED': -0.00010139752, 'ICAL': -4.3202e-07}
180	Cianidanol	WIKIPEDIA	Catechin is a flavan-3-ol, a type of secondary metabolite providing antioxidant roles in plants. It belongs to the subgroup of polyphenols called flavonoids. The name of the catechin chemical family derives from catechu, which is the tannic juice or boiled extract of Mimosa catechu (Acacia catechu L.f). == Chemistry == Catechin possesses two benzene rings (called the A and B rings) and a dihydropyran heterocycle (the C ring) with a hydroxyl group on carbon 3. The A ring is similar to a resorcinol moiety while the B ring is similar to a catechol moiety. There are two chiral centers on the molecule on carbons 2 and 3. Therefore, it has four diastereoisomers. Two of the isomers are in trans configuration and are called catechin and the other two are in cis configuration and are called epicatechin. The most common catechin isomer is (+)-catechin. The other stereoisomer is (−)-catechin or ent-catechin. The most common epicatechin isomer is (−)-epicatechin (also known under the names L-epicatechin, epicatechol, (−)-epicatechol, L-acacatechin, L-epicatechol, epicatechin, 2,3-cis-epicatechin or (2R,3R)-(−)-epicatechin). The different epimers can be separated using chiral column chromatography. Making reference to no particular isomer, the molecule can just be called catechin. Mixtures of the different enantiomers can be called (±)-catechin or DL-catechin and (±)-epicatechin or DL-epicatechin. Catechin and epicatechin are the building blocks of the proanthocyanidins, a type of condensed tannin. Diastereoisomers gallery Moreover, the flexibility of the C-ring allows for two conformation isomers, putting the B-ring either in a pseudoequatorial position (E conformer) or in a pseudoaxial position (A conformer). Studies confirmed that (+)-catechin adopts a mixture of A- and E-conformers in aqueous solution and their conformational equilibrium has been evaluated to be 33:67. As flavonoids, catechins can act as antioxidants when in high concentration in vitro, but compared with other flavonoids, their antioxidant potential is low. The ability to quench singlet oxygen seems to be in relation with the chemical structure of catechin, with the presence of the catechol moiety on ring B and the presence of a hydroxyl group activating the double bond on ring C. === Oxidation === Electrochemical experiments show that (+)-catechin oxidation mechanism proceeds in sequential steps, related with the catechol and resorcinol groups and the oxidation is pH-dependent. The oxidation of the catechol 3′,4′-dihydroxyl electron-donating groups occurs first, at very low positive potentials, and is a reversible reaction. The hydroxyl groups of the resorcinol moiety oxidised afterwards were shown to undergo an irreversible oxidation reaction. The laccase/ABTS system oxidizes (+)-catechin to oligomeric products of which proanthocyanidin A2 is a dimer. === Spectral data === == Natural occurrences == (+)-Catechin and (−)-epicatechin as well as their gallic acid conjugates are ubiquitous constituents of vascular plants, and frequent components of traditional herbal remedies, such as Uncaria rhynchophylla. The two isomers are mostly found as cacao and tea constituents, as well as in Vitis vinifera grapes. === In food === The main dietary sources of catechins in Europe and the United States are tea and pome fruits. Catechins and epicatechins are found in cocoa, which, according to one database, has the highest content (108 mg/100 g) of catechins among foods analyzed, followed by prune juice (25 mg/100 ml) and broad bean pod (16 mg/100 g). Açaí oil, obtained from the fruit of the açaí palm (Euterpe oleracea), contains (+)-catechins (67 mg/kg). Catechins are diverse among foods, from peaches to green tea and vinegar. Catechins are found in barley grain, where they are the main phenolic compound responsible for dough discoloration. The taste associated with monomeric (+)-catechin or (−)-epicatechin is described as slightly astringent, but not bitter. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of catechin begins with ma 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA starter unit which undergoes chain extension by the addition of three malonyl-CoAs through a PKSIII pathway. 4-Hydroxycinnamoyl CoA is biosynthesized from L-phenylalanine through the Shikimate pathway. L-Phenylalanine is first deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) forming cinnamic acid which is then oxidized to 4-hydroxycinnamic acid by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase. Chalcone synthase then catalyzes the condensation of 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA to form chalcone. Chalcone is then isomerized to naringenin by chalcone isomerase which is oxidized to eriodictyol by flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase and further oxidized to taxifolin by flavanone 3-hydroxylase. Taxifolin is then reduced by dihydroflavanol 4-reductase and leucoanthocyanidin reductase to yield catechin. The biosynthesis of catechin is shown below Leucocyanidin reductase (LCR) uses 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin to produce (+)-catechin and is the first enzyme in the proanthocyanidin (PA) specific pathway. Its activity has been measured in leaves, flowers, and seeds of the legumes Medicago sativa, Lotus japonicus, Lotus uliginosus, Hedysarum sulfurescens, and Robinia pseudoacacia. The enzyme is also present in Vitis vinifera (grape). === Biodegradation === Catechin oxygenase, a key enzyme in the degradation of catechin, is present in fungi and bacteria. Among bacteria, degradation of (+)-catechin can be achieved by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Catechin is metabolized to protocatechuic acid (PCA) and phloroglucinol carboxylic acid (PGCA). It is also degraded by Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Phloroglucinol carboxylic acid is further decarboxylated to phloroglucinol, which is dehydroxylated to resorcinol. Resorcinol is hydroxylated to hydroxyquinol. Protocatechuic acid and hydroxyquinol undergo intradiol cleavage through protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase and hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase to form β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid and maleyl acetate. Among fungi, degradation of catechin can be achieved by Chaetomium cupreum. === Metabolism in humans === Catechins are metabolised upon uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, in particular the jejunum, and in the liver, resulting in so-called structurally related epicatechin metabolites (SREM). The main metabolic pathways for SREMs are glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation of the catechol group by catechol-O-methyl transferase, with only small amounts detected in plasma. The majority of dietary catechins are however metabolised by the colonic microbiome to gamma-valerolactones and hippuric acids which undergo further biotransformation, glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation in the liver. The stereochemical configuration of catechins has a strong impact on their uptake and metabolism as uptake is highest for (−)-epicatechin and lowest for (−)-catechin. === Biotransformation === Biotransformation of (+)-catechin into taxifolin by a two-step oxidation can be achieved by Burkholderia sp. (+)-Catechin and (−)-epicatechin are transformed by the endophytic filamentous fungus Diaporthe sp. into the 3,4-cis-dihydroxyflavan derivatives, (+)-(2R,3S,4S)-3,4,5,7,3′,4′-hexahydroxyflavan (leucocyanidin) and (−)-(2R,3R,4R)-3,4,5,7,3′,4′-hexahydroxyflavan, respectively, whereas (−)-catechin and (+)-epicatechin with a (2S)-phenyl group resisted the biooxidation. Leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) uses (2R,3S)-catechin, NADP+ and H2O to produce 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin, NADPH, and H+. Its gene expression has been studied in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves. === Glycosides === (2R,3S)-Catechin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside can be isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and malt. Epigeoside (catechin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1–4)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1–6)-β-D-glucopyranoside) can be isolated from the rhizomes of Epigynum auritum. == Research == === Vascular function === Only limited evidence from dietary studies indicates that catechins may affect endothelium-dependent vasodilation which could contribute to normal blood flow regulation in humans. Green tea catechins may improve blood pressure, especially when systolic blood pressure is above 130 mmHg. Due to extensive metabolism during digestion, the fate and activity of catechin metabolites responsible for this effect on blood vessels, as well as the actual mode of action, are unknown. === Adverse events === Catechin and its metabolites can bind tightly to red blood cells and thereby induce the development of autoantibodies, resulting in haemolytic anaemia and renal failure. This resulted in the withdrawal of the catechin-containing drug Catergen, used to treat viral hepatitis, from market in 1985. Catechins from green tea can be hepatotoxic and the European Food Safety Authority has recommended not to exceed 800 mg per day. === Other === One limited meta-analysis showed that increasing consumption of green tea and its catechins to seven cups per day provided a small reduction in prostate cancer. Nanoparticle methods are under preliminary research as potential delivery systems of catechins. == Botanical effects == Catechins released into the ground by some plants may hinder the growth of their neighbors, a form of allelopathy. Centaurea maculosa, the spotted knapweed often studied for this behavior, releases catechin isomers into the ground through its roots, potentially having effects as an antibiotic or herbicide. One hypothesis is that it causes a reactive oxygen species wave through the target plant's root to kill root cells by apoptosis. Most plants in the European ecosystem have defenses against catechin, but few plants are protected against it in the North American ecosystem where Centaurea maculosa is an invasive, uncontrolled weed. Catechin acts as an infection-inhibiting factor in strawberry leaves. Epicatechin and catechin may prevent coffee berry disease by inhibiting appressorial melanization of Colletotrichum kahawae. == References == == External links == Media related to (+)-Catechin at Wikimedia Commons	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -0.054342404, 'OD': 0.0}
181	Dehydrolithocholic acid	PUBMED	 This study aimed to investigate the role of the gut microbiota (GM)-bile acid (BA)-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 axis in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Gut bacterial metabolisms of BAs were determined in an AF metagenomic dataset. The composition of faecal BAs pools was characterized by targeted metabolomics in an independent AF cross-sectional cohort. Circulating levels of FGF19 were measured by ELISA. In vitro cell experiments were conducted to validate the regulatory role of FGF19 in atrial cardiomyocytes stimulated with palmitic acid. First, metagenomic profiling revealed that gut microbial biotransformation from primary to secondary BAs was dysregulated in AF patients. Second, the proportion of secondary BAs decreased in the faeces of patients with AF. Also, eight BAs were identified as AF-associated BAs, including seven AF-enriched BAs (ursodeoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, etc.), and AF-decreased dehydrolithocholic acid. Third, reduced levels of circulating FGF19 were observed in patients with AF. Subsequently, FGF19 was found to protect against palmitic acid-induced lipid accumulation and dysregulated signalling in atrial cardiomyocytes, including attenuated phosphorylation of YAP and Ca Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a worldwide public health issue with an increasing number of patients annually. However, there is no curative drug for IBD, and the present medication for IBD generally focuses on suppressing hyperactive immune responses, which can only delay disease progression but inevitably induce off-target side effects, including infections and cancers. Herein, late-model orally administered nanotherapeutic micelles (HADLA) were developed based on a conjugate of hyaluronic acid (HA) and dehydrolithocholic acid (DLA), which was simple to achieve and obtained satisfactory therapeutic efficacy in a murine colitis model with a full safety profile. HADLA is capable of targeting inflammatory colon tissues, restoring intestinal barrier function and reducing intestinal epithelial cell death. Moreover, it modulates the adaptive immune system by inhibiting the activation of pathogenic T helper 17 (Th17) cells, and it exhibits more remarkable effects in preventing colitis than DLA alone. Finally, HADLA exhibits a remarkable ability to modulate dysregulated gut microbiomes by increasing beneficial probiotics and decreasing pathogenic bacteria, such as Turicibacter. Compared with the current systemic or subcutaneous administration of biologics, this study opens new avenues in the oral delivery of immune-modulating nanomedicine and introduces DLA as a new medication for IBD treatment. A growing body of evidence has linked the gut microbiota to liver metabolism. The manipulation of intestinal microflora has been considered as a promising avenue to promote liver health.

183	Pymetrozine	WIKIPEDIA	Pymetrozine is an insecticide in the pyridine-azomethine chemical class, primarily utilized for controlling homopteran pests, such as aphids and whiteflies, in agricultural settings. Its mode of action selectively targets the feeding behavior of sap-feeding insects, causing them to cease feeding soon after ingestion. This unique mechanism limits its impact on non-target organisms, including beneficial insects. Pymetrozine has been extensively used on rice, potatoes, a wide variety of vegetable brassica crops and various other crops as an alternative to organophosphorus pesticides. == Mechanism of action == Pymetrozine is a neuroactive insecticide that selectively affects chordotonal mechanoreceptors present in the legs of sap-feeding insects. It targetes specific ion channels in the nervous system of insects, particularly the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels. It is in IRAC group 9B. These channels, which consist of two key protein subunits, play a crucial role in sensory signal transduction. When pymetrozine binds to these channels, it alters their activity, leading to increased sensitivity and disruption of normal neuronal signaling. This mechanism results in impaired movement and behavior in target insects. Pymetrozine acts both on the plant's surface and internally, moving through vascular channels in multiple directions. It penetrates leaf tissues and remains effective when applied to either foliage or soil. Its internal movement within the plant does not interfere with growth processes, even after leaf-based applications. == Safety == Pymetrozine can cause cancer according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Pymetrozine is of low acute toxicity to humans, mammals, birds, aquatic organisms, and bees. It is a respiratory tract irritant and ingestion may affect major organs at high doses. It may cause reproductive or developmental defects. == Ecotoxicity == Pymetrozine has low off-target effects. The half-life of pymetrozine in water, soil, and rice plants is 2.81, 6.95, and 3.70 days respectively. 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (3-PCA) and 4-amino-6-methyl-2 H-1,2,4-triazine-3-one are the primary degradation products of pymetrozine on photodegradation. Exposure to 3-PCA has been reported to cause developmental toxicity in zebrafish. == Use == The annual usage of pymetrozine was at least 4.45 × 103 t in China according to its consumption (150 g/ha) and area of rice field (2.97 × 107 ha). == References ==	INDUSTRIAL	INDUSTRIAL	{'IND': 0.0, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0}
184	Triphenyl phosphate	WIKIPEDIA	"Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) is the chemical compound with the formula OP(OC6H5)3. It is the simplest aromatic organophosphate. This colourless solid is the ester (triester) of phosphoric acid and phenol. It is used as a plasticizer and a fire retardant in a wide variety of settings and products. == Preparation == Triphenyl phosphate is prepared by the SN2 reaction of phosphorus oxychloride and phenol. == Uses == Triphenyl phosphate has been used widely as a flame retardant and plasticizer. It has been used as a flame retardant for a variety of materials, including electronic equipment, PVC, hydraulic fluids, glues, in nail polishes, and casting resins. Its mechanism of action as a flame retardant is as follows: first, during thermal decomposition, phosphoric acid is formed. This reacts to form pyrophosphoric acid, which, when in its condensed phase, acts to block heat transfer. One of the most effective flame retardants for certain polymers, TPhP is only active as an additive flame retardant in its gas phase. Phase out of PBDEs may have increased the use of TPhP in recent years. TPhP is also used as a plasticizer in lacquers, varnishes, and hydraulic fluids. Nail polish has received particular interest as a source of exposure to TPhP. == Toxicology == Limited information is available indicating significant toxicological effects of TPhP. Although it was initially expected to have an overall low impact, a growing body of evidence suggests that the effects may not be so harmless. Triphenyl phosphate exhibits low acute toxicity by dermal or oral contact. However, an increasing number of studies have linked exposure to TPhP with reproductive and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, metabolic disruption, endocrine effects, and genotoxicity. TPhP has also been found to induce significant estrogenic activity. One study found that concentrations above the lowest observable effect level have been observed in a variety of other studies in coral grouper, yellow striped goat fish, and freshwater perch. This indicates that TPhP may be present in the environment at high enough concentrations to have harmful ecological effects. The European Chemicals agency considers TPhP to be ""very toxic"" to aquatic life, with potentially long-lasting effects. In contrast to many persistent organic pollutants, TPHP has limited affinity for lipids. Still, bioaccumulation of the compound has been found to occur at varying levels in fish, with the strongest patterns showing up based on gender, feeding patterns, and metabolic efficiency. However, the mechanisms explaining why and how TPhP accumulates in this manner are not yet known. == Environmental transport and transformations == Triphenyl phosphate has been detected in the environment. Other triaryl phosphates have been known to enter aquatic environments through volatilization and leaching from plastics, through hydraulic fluid leakages, and, to a lesser degree, through manufacturing processes. TPhP, in particular, has been found to enter the environment through industrial use, as in the manufacturing process, and through indoor use, for example through paints and electronic equipment. As with many other phosphorus-containing flame retardants, TPhP has been found widely in sediment, soil, indoor dust, and air. Once in water, TPhP has been found to biodegrade relatively quickly under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and does not meet criteria for being categorized as persistent. However, although the compound biodegrades easily and does not bioaccumulate, it is readily detected because of the sheer volume that is utilized. In 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency added TPhP to its list of Toxic Substance Control Act Work Plan for Chemicals on the basis that the compound has exhibited ""acute and chronic aquatic toxicity,"" ""moderate bioaccumulation potential,"" and ""moderate environmental persistence."" Still, there is not yet enough information to fully assess the environmental impact of TPhP. == References =="	INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE	INDUSTRIAL	{'IND': -3.1281633e-07, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0}
187	Succinyladenosine	PUBMED	 From the urines of colon carcinoma patients and normal subjects we have isolated a nucleoside in which an amino group of aspartic acid is attached to the six position of purine ribonucleoside. The structure, N6-succinyladenosine, N-(9-B-D-ribofuranosylpurin-6-yl)aspartic acid was assigned on the basis of spectral data, chemical degradation, and by synthesis. The ultraviolet and mass spectra, chromatographic and electrophoretic mobilities, and the chemical properties of the naturally occurring nucleoside were identical to those of the synthetic N6-succinyladenosine. In contrast to the methylated and hypermodified nucleosides which are products of RNA catabolism, this urinary nucleoside appears to be derived from adenylosuccinic acid, a key intermediate required in the biosynthesis of ubiquitous, natural purine nucleotide adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP). Succinyladenosine (S-Ado) is a biochemical marker of adenylosuccinase deficiency--the genetic defect of purine de novo synthesis. S-Ado has been previously reported as normally undetectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children not suffering from this defect. In present study, we employed solid-phase extraction and thin-layer chromatography for isolation of a compound with spectral and chromatographic characteristics identical to S-Ado from human CSF. The high-performance liquid chromatography-negative-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the isolated compound is S-Ado. We established the reference values of S-Ado in CSF of children (1.1+/-0.4 micromol/l; mean +/- S.D; n = 26) by means of reversed-phase HPLC method on a C18 column with UV detection. The enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) intervenes twice in the biosynthesis of adenine nucleotides. ADSL deficiency is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by various degrees of psychomotor retardation and accumulation of dephosphorylated enzyme substrates 5-amino-4-imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (SAdo) in body fluids. Severity of symptoms seems to correlate with residual activity of mutant enzyme and with SAdo/SAICAr concentration ratio in cerebrospinal fluid. To better understand the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease symptoms, studies of catalytic properties of mutant enzymes together with in vitro and in vivo experiments utilizing SAICAr and SAdo must be performed. Such studies require availability of both ADSL substrates, 5-amino-4-imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) and succinyladenosine 5'-monophosphate (SAMP) and their dephosphorylated products in sufficient amounts and purity. Except for SAMP, none of these compounds is commercially available and they must therefore be synthesized. SAICAR was prepared by recombinant human ADSL-catalysed reaction of AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide) with fumarate and isolated by thin-layer chromatography. SAICAr and SAdo were prepared by calf intestine alkaline phosphatase-catalysed dephosphorylation of SAICAR and SAMP and isolated on cation- and anion-exchange resin columns. The procedures described are easily scalable and provide high yields of sufficiently pure products for use in experiments related to studies of pathogenetic mechanisms in ADSL deficiency.

190	Hemin	WIKIPEDIA	"Hemin (haemin; ferric chloride heme) is an iron-containing porphyrin with chlorine that can be formed from a heme group, such as heme B found in the hemoglobin of human blood. == Chemistry == Hemin is protoporphyrin IX containing a ferric iron (Fe3+) ion with a coordinating chloride ligand. Chemically, hemin differs from the related heme-compound hematin chiefly in that the coordinating ion is a chloride ion in hemin, whereas the coordinating ion is a hydroxide ion in hematin. The iron ion in haem is ferrous (Fe2+), whereas it is ferric (Fe3+) in both hemin and hematin. Hemin is endogenously produced in the human body, for example during the turnover of old red blood cells. It can form inappropriately as a result of hemolysis or vascular injury. Several proteins in human blood bind to hemin, such as hemopexin and serum albumin. == Pharmacological use == A lyophilised form of hemin is used as a pharmacological agent in certain cases for the treatment of porphyria attacks, particularly in acute intermittent porphyria. Administration of hemin can reduce heme deficits in such patients, thereby suppressing the activity of delta-amino-levulinic acid synthase (a key enzyme in the synthesis of the porphyrins) by biochemical feedback, which in turn reduces the production of porphyrins and of the toxic precursors of heme. In such pharmacological contexts, hemin is typically formulated with human albumin prior to administration by a medical professional, to reduce the risk of phlebitis and to stabilize the compound, which is potentially reactive if allowed to circulate in free-form. Such pharmacological forms of hemin are sold under a range of trade names including the trademarks Panhematin and Normosang. == History of isolation == Hemin was first crystallized out of blood in 1853, by Ludwik Karol Teichmann. Teichmann discovered that blood pigments can form microscopic crystals. Thus, crystals of hemin are occasionally referred to as 'Teichmann crystals'. Hans Fischer synthesized hemin, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1930. Fischer's procedure involves treating defibrinated blood with a solution of sodium chloride in acetic acid. == Forensics == Hemin can be produced from hemoglobin by the so-called Teichmann test, when hemoglobin is heated with glacial acetic acid (saturated with saline). This can be used to detect blood traces. == Other == Hemin is considered the ""X factor"" required for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae. == References == == External links == Hemin at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)"	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	{'MED': -0.0017954893, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -3.1737043e-06, ' EN': -1.700133e-05, 'DO': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
193	Econazole	WIKIPEDIA	"Econazole is an antifungal medication of the imidazole class. It was patented in 1968, and approved for medical use in 1974. == Medical uses == Econazole is used as a cream to treat skin infections such as athlete's foot, tinea, pityriasis versicolor, ringworm, and jock itch. It is also sold in Canada under the brand name Ecostatin as vaginal ovules to treat vaginal thrush. Econazole nitrate exhibits strong anti-feeding properties against the keratin-digesting common clothes moth Tineola bisselliella. == Adverse effects == About 3% of patients treated with econazole nitrate cream reported side effects. The most common symptoms were burning, itching, redness (erythema), and one outbreak of a pruritic rash. == Synthesis == Imidazoles devoid of the nitro group no longer have any antiprotozoal activity, however, such drugs are effective antifungal agents. Alkylation of imidazole (2) with bromoketone (1) prepared from o,p-dichloroacetophenone affords the displacement product (3). Reduction of the ketone with sodium borohydride gives the corresponding alcohol (4). Alkylation of the alkoxide from that alcohol with p-chlorobenzyl chloride leads to econazole (5); alkylation with o,p-dichlorobenzyl chloride gives miconazole. == Society and culture == === Brand names === It is sold under the brand names Spectrazole (United States) and Ecostatin (Canada), among others.

197	(-)-epicatechin	WIKIPEDIA	Catechin is a flavan-3-ol, a type of secondary metabolite providing antioxidant roles in plants. It belongs to the subgroup of polyphenols called flavonoids. The name of the catechin chemical family derives from catechu, which is the tannic juice or boiled extract of Mimosa catechu (Acacia catechu L.f). == Chemistry == Catechin possesses two benzene rings (called the A and B rings) and a dihydropyran heterocycle (the C ring) with a hydroxyl group on carbon 3. The A ring is similar to a resorcinol moiety while the B ring is similar to a catechol moiety. There are two chiral centers on the molecule on carbons 2 and 3. Therefore, it has four diastereoisomers. Two of the isomers are in trans configuration and are called catechin and the other two are in cis configuration and are called epicatechin. The most common catechin isomer is (+)-catechin. The other stereoisomer is (−)-catechin or ent-catechin. The most common epicatechin isomer is (−)-epicatechin (also known under the names L-epicatechin, epicatechol, (−)-epicatechol, L-acacatechin, L-epicatechol, epicatechin, 2,3-cis-epicatechin or (2R,3R)-(−)-epicatechin). The different epimers can be separated using chiral column chromatography. Making reference to no particular isomer, the molecule can just be called catechin. Mixtures of the different enantiomers can be called (±)-catechin or DL-catechin and (±)-epicatechin or DL-epicatechin. Catechin and epicatechin are the building blocks of the proanthocyanidins, a type of condensed tannin. Diastereoisomers gallery Moreover, the flexibility of the C-ring allows for two conformation isomers, putting the B-ring either in a pseudoequatorial position (E conformer) or in a pseudoaxial position (A conformer). Studies confirmed that (+)-catechin adopts a mixture of A- and E-conformers in aqueous solution and their conformational equilibrium has been evaluated to be 33:67. As flavonoids, catechins can act as antioxidants when in high concentration in vitro, but compared with other flavonoids, their antioxidant potential is low. The ability to quench singlet oxygen seems to be in relation with the chemical structure of catechin, with the presence of the catechol moiety on ring B and the presence of a hydroxyl group activating the double bond on ring C. === Oxidation === Electrochemical experiments show that (+)-catechin oxidation mechanism proceeds in sequential steps, related with the catechol and resorcinol groups and the oxidation is pH-dependent. The oxidation of the catechol 3′,4′-dihydroxyl electron-donating groups occurs first, at very low positive potentials, and is a reversible reaction. The hydroxyl groups of the resorcinol moiety oxidised afterwards were shown to undergo an irreversible oxidation reaction. The laccase/ABTS system oxidizes (+)-catechin to oligomeric products of which proanthocyanidin A2 is a dimer. === Spectral data === == Natural occurrences == (+)-Catechin and (−)-epicatechin as well as their gallic acid conjugates are ubiquitous constituents of vascular plants, and frequent components of traditional herbal remedies, such as Uncaria rhynchophylla. The two isomers are mostly found as cacao and tea constituents, as well as in Vitis vinifera grapes. === In food === The main dietary sources of catechins in Europe and the United States are tea and pome fruits. Catechins and epicatechins are found in cocoa, which, according to one database, has the highest content (108 mg/100 g) of catechins among foods analyzed, followed by prune juice (25 mg/100 ml) and broad bean pod (16 mg/100 g). Açaí oil, obtained from the fruit of the açaí palm (Euterpe oleracea), contains (+)-catechins (67 mg/kg). Catechins are diverse among foods, from peaches to green tea and vinegar. Catechins are found in barley grain, where they are the main phenolic compound responsible for dough discoloration. The taste associated with monomeric (+)-catechin or (−)-epicatechin is described as slightly astringent, but not bitter. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of catechin begins with ma 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA starter unit which undergoes chain extension by the addition of three malonyl-CoAs through a PKSIII pathway. 4-Hydroxycinnamoyl CoA is biosynthesized from L-phenylalanine through the Shikimate pathway. L-Phenylalanine is first deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) forming cinnamic acid which is then oxidized to 4-hydroxycinnamic acid by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase. Chalcone synthase then catalyzes the condensation of 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA to form chalcone. Chalcone is then isomerized to naringenin by chalcone isomerase which is oxidized to eriodictyol by flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase and further oxidized to taxifolin by flavanone 3-hydroxylase. Taxifolin is then reduced by dihydroflavanol 4-reductase and leucoanthocyanidin reductase to yield catechin. The biosynthesis of catechin is shown below Leucocyanidin reductase (LCR) uses 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin to produce (+)-catechin and is the first enzyme in the proanthocyanidin (PA) specific pathway. Its activity has been measured in leaves, flowers, and seeds of the legumes Medicago sativa, Lotus japonicus, Lotus uliginosus, Hedysarum sulfurescens, and Robinia pseudoacacia. The enzyme is also present in Vitis vinifera (grape). === Biodegradation === Catechin oxygenase, a key enzyme in the degradation of catechin, is present in fungi and bacteria. Among bacteria, degradation of (+)-catechin can be achieved by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Catechin is metabolized to protocatechuic acid (PCA) and phloroglucinol carboxylic acid (PGCA). It is also degraded by Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Phloroglucinol carboxylic acid is further decarboxylated to phloroglucinol, which is dehydroxylated to resorcinol. Resorcinol is hydroxylated to hydroxyquinol. Protocatechuic acid and hydroxyquinol undergo intradiol cleavage through protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase and hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase to form β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid and maleyl acetate. Among fungi, degradation of catechin can be achieved by Chaetomium cupreum. === Metabolism in humans === Catechins are metabolised upon uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, in particular the jejunum, and in the liver, resulting in so-called structurally related epicatechin metabolites (SREM). The main metabolic pathways for SREMs are glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation of the catechol group by catechol-O-methyl transferase, with only small amounts detected in plasma. The majority of dietary catechins are however metabolised by the colonic microbiome to gamma-valerolactones and hippuric acids which undergo further biotransformation, glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation in the liver. The stereochemical configuration of catechins has a strong impact on their uptake and metabolism as uptake is highest for (−)-epicatechin and lowest for (−)-catechin. === Biotransformation === Biotransformation of (+)-catechin into taxifolin by a two-step oxidation can be achieved by Burkholderia sp. (+)-Catechin and (−)-epicatechin are transformed by the endophytic filamentous fungus Diaporthe sp. into the 3,4-cis-dihydroxyflavan derivatives, (+)-(2R,3S,4S)-3,4,5,7,3′,4′-hexahydroxyflavan (leucocyanidin) and (−)-(2R,3R,4R)-3,4,5,7,3′,4′-hexahydroxyflavan, respectively, whereas (−)-catechin and (+)-epicatechin with a (2S)-phenyl group resisted the biooxidation. Leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) uses (2R,3S)-catechin, NADP+ and H2O to produce 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin, NADPH, and H+. Its gene expression has been studied in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves. === Glycosides === (2R,3S)-Catechin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside can be isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and malt. Epigeoside (catechin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1–4)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1–6)-β-D-glucopyranoside) can be isolated from the rhizomes of Epigynum auritum. == Research == === Vascular function === Only limited evidence from dietary studies indicates that catechins may affect endothelium-dependent vasodilation which could contribute to normal blood flow regulation in humans. Green tea catechins may improve blood pressure, especially when systolic blood pressure is above 130 mmHg. Due to extensive metabolism during digestion, the fate and activity of catechin metabolites responsible for this effect on blood vessels, as well as the actual mode of action, are unknown. === Adverse events === Catechin and its metabolites can bind tightly to red blood cells and thereby induce the development of autoantibodies, resulting in haemolytic anaemia and renal failure. This resulted in the withdrawal of the catechin-containing drug Catergen, used to treat viral hepatitis, from market in 1985. Catechins from green tea can be hepatotoxic and the European Food Safety Authority has recommended not to exceed 800 mg per day. === Other === One limited meta-analysis showed that increasing consumption of green tea and its catechins to seven cups per day provided a small reduction in prostate cancer. Nanoparticle methods are under preliminary research as potential delivery systems of catechins. == Botanical effects == Catechins released into the ground by some plants may hinder the growth of their neighbors, a form of allelopathy. Centaurea maculosa, the spotted knapweed often studied for this behavior, releases catechin isomers into the ground through its roots, potentially having effects as an antibiotic or herbicide. One hypothesis is that it causes a reactive oxygen species wave through the target plant's root to kill root cells by apoptosis. Most plants in the European ecosystem have defenses against catechin, but few plants are protected against it in the North American ecosystem where Centaurea maculosa is an invasive, uncontrolled weed. Catechin acts as an infection-inhibiting factor in strawberry leaves. Epicatechin and catechin may prevent coffee berry disease by inhibiting appressorial melanization of Colletotrichum kahawae. == References == == External links == Media related to (+)-Catechin at Wikimedia Commons	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -1.0206721e-05, 'OD': 0.0}
200	Fraxidin	PUBMED	 Coumarins are plant-derived secondary metabolites. The crystal structure of three coumarins-bergamottin, osthole and fraxidin-are described and we analyze intermolecular interactions and their role in crystal formation. Bergamottin is a furanocoumarin found in citrus plants, which is a strong inhibitor of the principal human metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The crystal structure determinations of three coumarins give us the geometrical parameters and reveal the parallel-displaced π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding intermolecular interactions used for molecular assembly in the crystal structure. A quite strong (less than 3.4 Å) stacking interaction of bergamottin appears to be a determining feature that distinguishes it from other coumarins studied in this work. Our DFT computational studies on the three natural products of the same coumarin family docked into the active site of CYP3A4 (PDB 4D78) show different behavior for these coumarins at the active site. When the substrate is bergamottin, the importance of π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding, which can anchor the substrate in place, appears fundamental. In contrast, fraxidin and osthole show carbonyl coordination to iron. Our docking calculations show that the bergamottin tendency towards π-π stacking is important and likely influences its interactions with the heme group of CYP3A4.

207	Tauroursodeoxycholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Ursodoxicoltaurine is the international nonproprietary name (INN) for the pharmaceutical form of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). It is also known as taurursodiol. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid which is the taurine conjugated form of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Humans have only trace amounts of tauroursodeoxycholic acid but bears have large amounts of tauroursodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid in their bile. == Synthesis == Bile acids are naturally synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and are conjugated with specific amino-acids, specifically taurine. Bear bile contains several bile acids including taurochenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. UDCA and its taurine conjugates comprise about 47% of the bile in American black bears and up to 76% in Asiatic bears. Ursodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid were first chemically synthesized in 1954 in Japan. Ursodeoxycholic acid is produced in several countries for the treatment of gallstones and primary biliary cholangitis. == Medical uses == In Canada and the United States, ursodoxicoltaurine, in combination with sodium phenylbutyrate, was indicated for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Following failed results from the phase 3 PHOENIX trial (NCT05021536) It has been removed from the market in April 2024. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals has announced that effective immediately Relyvrio will no longer be available. == Cellular mechanisms == Apoptosis is largely influenced by the mitochondria. If the mitochondria are distressed, they release cytochrome C (cyC) and calcium which activate caspases to propagate a cascade of cellular mechanisms to cause apoptosis. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevents apoptosis with its role in the BAX pathway. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevents BAX from being transported to the mitochondria which protects the mitochondria from perturbation and the activation of caspases. Many effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid appear to be dependent on the activation of the cell membrane receptors TGR5, S1PR2 and α5β1-Integrin. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid also acts as a chemical chaperone to help maintain the stability and correct folding of proteins. == Research == Ursodoxicoltaurine has been shown to reduce apoptosis and to have protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases and the eye, particularly for retinal degenerative disorders. Studies have shown that tauroursodeoxycholic acid has neuroprotective actions based on its potent ability to inhibit apoptosis, attenuate oxidative stress, and reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress in different experimental models of these illnesses. Studies have shown protective effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid in eye diseases. === Photoreceptor cells === A study examined the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid on cones, in relation to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease in which retinal rods and cones undergo apoptosis. Mice models were used, a wild-type and a mutant RP model, rd10. Both models were injected with tauroursodeoxycholic acid every 3 days from post-natal day 6 (p6) to p30 and compared to the vehicle. Electroretinography (ERG), photoreceptor cell counts, cone photoreceptor nuclei counts, and TUNEL labeling were all analyzed to show the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine. The dark-adapted and light-adapted ERG responses were greater in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated mouse than the vehicle treated mouse. Ursodoxicoltaurine treated mice also had more photoreceptor counts, yet non-altered retinal morphology or function. Even at P30, a stage where rod and cone function is usually greatly diminished in the rd10 mouse model, the photoreceptor function was protected. Another study, from the Department of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, saw similar effects in two components of bile, bilirubin and ursodoxicoltaurine, in relation to RP. Oxidative stress and prolonged light exposure were studied in rd10 mice and albino mice. In rd10 mice, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or ursodoxicoltaurine were given every 3 days starting at P6. This caused a considerable preservation in cone cell amount and function at P50, and a modest rod cell amount at P30. In the albino mice models, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or ursodoxicoltaurine were given prior to prolonged light exposure. Both treatments had positive effects on the health of the mouse retina, including a reduced accumulation of superoxide radicals, rod cell death, and disruption of cone inner and outer segments. The findings of the study are elucidating optimized conditions for RP treatment. === Choroidal neovascularization === A study done at the Department of Ophthalmology at Seoul National University College of Medicine examined the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA on laser-treated choroids of rat models. Argon lasers were used to induce choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rat models. Ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA were injected intraperitoneally 24 hours before and daily after the laser treatment. Fourteen days after laser-treatment, the eyes were examined for effects. Fluorescein angiography showed lower leakage from the CNV in UDCA and ursodoxicoltaurine treated groups than the control group. Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the retina were examined and showed lower levels in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated group compared to the control group, whereas no effect in the UDCA treated group. ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA may suppress CNV formation, which may be associated with its anti-inflammatory effects. === Synaptic connectivity === A study from the Department of Physiology in University of Alicante, in Alicante, Spain, shows the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine in the P23H transgenic rat, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The transgenic rats were injected with ursodoxicoltaurine once a week starting from P21 until P120, along with vehicle-administered controls. At P120, the functionality of the retina was examined via ERG and immunoflourescent microscopy. The amplitude of the a- and b- waves were considerably higher in ursodoxicoltaurine treated rats, compared to the control group. Photoreceptor density in the center of the retina was three-fold greater in ursodoxicoltaurine treated rats. Also, TUNEL results showed smaller amounts of TUNEL-positive cells. The synaptic contacts amongst photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells were preserved in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated P23H rats. Additionally, the synaptic terminals in the outer plexiform layer were of greater density that in control rats. The neuroprotective effects of ursodoxicoltaurine are not only preserving retinal morphology and function, but also its synaptic contacts, a potentially useful aspect in delaying RP. === Other diseases === Tauroursodeoxycholic acid has also been suggested to have potential application in heart disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke in view of the drug's ability to reduce apoptotic effects. == References ==	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	MEDICAL	{'MED': -7.362307e-05, 'ICAL': 0.0}

212	Enniatin b1	PUBMED	" Although over the last 10 years several studies have focused on the emerging mycotoxins known as enniatins (ENNs), there is still a lack of knowledge regarding their toxicological effects and the development of a correct risk assessment. This is especially true for enniatin B1 (ENN B1), considered the younger sister of the widely studied enniatin B (ENN B). ENN B1 has been found in several food commodities and, as with other mycotoxins, presents antibacterial and antifungal properties. On the other hand, ENN B1 has shown cytotoxic activity, impairment of the cell cycle, the induction of oxidative stress, and changes in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, as well as negative genotoxic and estrogenic effects. Overall, considering the paucity of information available regarding ENN B1, further studies are necessary to perform a risk assessment. This review summarizes information on the biological characteristics and toxicological effects of ENN B1 as well as the future challenges that this mycotoxin could present. Enniatin B1 (ENN B1) is a mycotoxin that can be found in various foods. However, whether ENN B1 is hazardous to the reproductive system is still elusive. Leydig cells are testosterone-generating cells that reside in the interstitial compartment between seminiferous tubules. Dysfunction of Leydig cells could result in male infertility. This study aimed to examine the toxicological effects of ENN B1 against TM3 Leydig cells. ENN B1 significantly inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. ENN B1 treatment also decreased the expression of functional genes in Leydig cells. Moreover, ENN B1 induced Leydig cells apoptosis and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, ENN B1 leads to the upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 in Leydig cells. In addition, ENN B1 inhibited the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which is critical for the induction of oxidative stress. Additionally, ENN B1 treatment repressed the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in Leydig cells. Rescue experiments showed that activation of STAT3 resulted in alleviation of ENN B1-induced damage in Leydig cells. Collectively, our study demonstrated that ENN B1 induced Leydig cell dysfunction via multiple mechanisms. Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the ""emerging"" mycotoxins, which are produced by various Fusarium species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described in vitro, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins in vivo are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC50 = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC50 = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier in vitro were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell® filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1. Thus, both compounds can reach the brain parenchyma where neurotoxic effects cannot be ruled out."	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -9.066919e-05, 'OD': 0.0}
214	Lamotrigine	WIKIPEDIA	"Lamotrigine, sold under the brand name Lamictal among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy and stabilize mood in bipolar disorder. For epilepsy, this includes focal seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In bipolar disorder, lamotrigine has not been shown to reliably treat acute depression in any groups except for the severely depressed; but for patients with bipolar disorder who are not currently symptomatic, it appears to reduce the risk of future episodes of depression. Common side effects include nausea, sleepiness, headache, vomiting, trouble with coordination, and rash. Serious side effects include excessive breakdown of red blood cells, increased risk of suicide, severe skin reaction (Stevens–Johnson syndrome), and allergic reactions, which can be fatal. Lamotrigine is a phenyltriazine, making it chemically different from other anticonvulsants. Its mechanism of action is not clear, but it appears to inhibit release of excitatory neurotransmitters via voltage-sensitive sodium channels and voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons. Lamotrigine was first marketed in Ireland in 1991, and approved for use in the United States in 1994. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 58th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 11 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Epilepsy === Lamotrigine is considered a first-line drug for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (includes simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures such as focal-onset tonic-clonic seizures). It is also used as an alternative or adjuvant medication for partial seizures, such as absence seizure, myoclonic seizure, and atonic seizures. The evidence supporting the use of lamotrigine as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant generalized tonic-clonic seizures is not clear enough to inform clinical practice. Although low-certainty evidence suggests that it reduces generalized tonic-clonic seizures by 50% the level of uncertainty indicates that the actual findings could be significantly different. Evidence supporting the use of lamotrigine as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy found that it is likely effective for reducing seizure frequency and is generally well tolerated. Lamotrigine has some side effects including a risk of dizziness, nausea, ataxia, or visual disturbances such as diplopia. The long-term effects of lamotrigine have not been investigated. ==== Lennox–Gastaut syndrome ==== Lamotrigine is one of a small number of FDA-approved therapies for the form of epilepsy known as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. It reduces the frequency of LGS seizures, and is one of two medications known to decrease the severity of drop attacks. Combination with valproate is common, but this increases the risk of lamotrigine-induced severe skin reaction Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and necessitates reduced dosing due to the interaction of these drugs. === Bipolar disorder === Lamotrigine is approved in the US for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. While the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are predominantly antimanics, lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy only in preventing or reducing the risk of recurrent depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. The drug seems ineffective in the treatment of current rapid-cycling, acute mania, or acute depression in bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine has been shown to be as effective as lithium, the standard treatment for bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine has not demonstrated clear efficacy in treating acute mood episodes, either mania or depression. It has not demonstrated effectiveness in treating acute mania, and there is controversy regarding the drug's effectiveness in treating acute bipolar depression. A paper written in 2008 by Nassir et al. reviewed evidence from trials that were unpublished and not referenced in the 2002 APA guidelines, and it concludes that lamotrigine has ""very limited, if any, efficacy in the treatment of acute bipolar depression"". A 2008 paper by Calabrese et al. examined much of the same data, and found that in five placebo-controlled studies, lamotrigine did not significantly differ from placebo in the treatment of bipolar depression. However, in a meta-analysis of these studies conducted in 2008, Geddes, Calabrese, and Goodwin found that lamotrigine was effective in individuals with bipolar depression, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 11, or 7 in severe depression. A 2013 review concluded that lamotrigine is recommended in bipolar maintenance when depression is prominent and that more research is needed regarding its role in the treatment of acute bipolar depression and unipolar depression. No information to recommend its use in other psychiatric disorders was found. === Schizophrenia === Lamotrigine, as a monotherapy, is not substantially effective against schizophrenia. However, various publications and textbooks have expressed that lamotrigine could be added to clozapine as augmentation therapy against partial or non-responding patients with schizophrenia. Patients had statistically significant improvements in positive, negative and affective symptoms. Lamotrigine does not have a statistically significant effect with antipsychotics other than clozapine, such as: olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, zuclopenthixol, etc. === Other uses === Off-label uses include the treatment of peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headaches, migraines, visual snow, and reducing neuropathic pain, although a systematic review conducted in 2013 concluded that well-designed clinical trials have shown no benefit for lamotrigine in neuropathic pain. Off-label psychiatric usage includes the treatment of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, depersonalization derealization disorder, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and borderline personality disorder. It has not been shown to be useful in post-traumatic stress disorder. GlaxoSmithKline investigated lamotrigine for the treatment of ADHD with inconclusive results. No detrimental effects on cognitive function were observed; however, the only statistical improvement in core ADHD symptoms was an improvement on a Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test that measures auditory processing speed and calculation ability. Another study reported that lamotrigine might be a safe and effective treatment option for adult ADHD comorbid with bipolar and recurrent depression. == Side effects == Side effects such as rash, fever, and fatigue are very serious, as they may indicate incipient SJS, TEN, DRESS syndrome, or aseptic meningitis. Lamotrigine prescribing information has a black box warning about life-threatening skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), DRESS syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The manufacturer states that nearly all cases appear in the first two to eight weeks of therapy. Patients should seek medical attention for any unexpected skin rash, as its presence is an indication of a possible serious or even deadly side effect of the drug. Not all rashes that occur while taking lamotrigine progress to SJS or TEN. Between 5 and 10% of patients will develop a rash, but only one in a thousand patients will develop a serious rash. Rash and other skin reactions are more common in children, so this medication is often reserved for adults. For patients whose lamotrigine has been stopped after the development of a rash, rechallenge with lamotrigine is also a viable option. Usually, rechallenge is done by reinstating lamotrigine at a smaller dose (5mg/day). However, it does not apply to very serious cases. The incidence of these eruptions increases in patients who are currently on, or recently discontinued a valproate-type anticonvulsant drug, as these medications interact in such a way that the clearance of both is decreased and the effective dose of lamotrigine is increased. In 2018, the FDA required a new warning for the risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This serious reaction can occur between days to weeks after starting the treatment. Other side effects include alopecia (hair loss), loss of balance or coordination, double vision, crossed eyes, pupil constriction, blurred vision, dizziness and lack of coordination, drowsiness, insomnia, anxiety, vivid dreams or nightmares, dry mouth, mouth ulcers, memory problems, mood changes, itchiness, runny nose, cough, nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, weight loss, missed or painful menstrual periods, and vaginitis. The side-effects profile varies for different patient populations. Overall adverse effects in treatment are similar between men, women, geriatric, pediatric, and racial groups. Lamotrigine has been associated with a decrease in white blood cell count (leukopenia). Lamotrigine does not prolong QT/QTc in TQT studies in healthy subjects. In people taking antipsychotics, cases of lamotrigine-precipitated neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported. === Women === Women are more likely than men to have side effects. Some evidence shows interactions between lamotrigine and female hormones, which can be of particular concern for women on estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives. Ethinylestradiol, an ingredient of such contraceptives, has been shown to decrease serum levels of lamotrigine. Women starting an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive may need to increase the dosage of lamotrigine to maintain its level of efficacy. Likewise, women may experience an increase in lamotrigine side effects upon discontinuation of birth control pills. This may include the ""pill-free"" week where lamotrigine serum levels have been shown to increase twofold. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Many studies have found no association between lamotrigine exposure in utero and birth defects, while those that have found an association have found only slight associations with minor malformations such as cleft palates. Review studies have found that overall rates of congenital malformations in infants exposed to lamotrigine in utero are relatively low (1–4%), which is similar to the rate of malformations in the general population. It is known that lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and other, more powerful, human DHFR inhibitors such as methotrexate are known to be teratogenic. Lamotrigine is expressed in breast milk; the manufacturer recommends carefully weighing the benefits and risks of taking lamotrigine while breastfeeding. However, some studies suggest that lamotrigine is safe to use while breastfeeding. A frequently updated review of scientific literature rates lamotrigine as L3: moderately safe. === Other types of effects === Lamotrigine binds to melanin-containing tissues such as the iris of the eye or melanin-rich skin. The long-term consequences of this are unknown. Lamotrigine is known to affect sleep. Studies with small numbers of patients (10–15) reported that lamotrigine increases the duration of REM sleep, decreases the number of phase shifts, and decreases the duration of slow-wave sleep, and that there was no effect on vigilance, daytime somnolence and cognitive function. However, a retrospective study of 109 patients' medical records found that 6.7% of patients experienced an ""alerting effect"" resulting in intolerable insomnia, for which the treatment had to be discontinued. Lamotrigine can induce a type of seizure known as a myoclonic jerk, which tends to happen soon after the use of the medication. When used in the treatment of myoclonic epilepsies such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, lower doses (and lower plasma levels) are usually needed, as even moderate doses of this drug can induce seizures, including tonic-clonic seizures, which can develop into status epilepticus, which is a medical emergency. It can also cause myoclonic status epilepticus. In overdose, lamotrigine can cause uncontrolled seizures in most people. Reported results in overdoses involving up to 15 g include increased seizures, coma, and death. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Lamotrigine is a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs. This may suppress the release of glutamate and aspartate, two dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. It is generally accepted to be a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs, but it could have additional actions, since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel-blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its sigma receptor activity. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasizes its unique properties. It is a triazine derivate that inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, leading to stabilization of neuronal membranes. It also blocks L-, N-, and P-type calcium channels and weakly inhibits the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. These actions are thought to inhibit release of glutamate at cortical projections in the ventral striatum limbic areas, and its neuroprotective and antiglutamatergic effects have been pointed out as promising contributors to its mood stabilizing activity. Observations that lamotrigine reduced GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in rat amygdala suggest that a GABAergic mechanism may also be involved. It appears that lamotrigine does not increase GABA blood levels in humans. Lamotrigine does not have pronounced effects on any of the usual neurotransmitter receptors that anticonvulsants affect (adrenergic, dopamine D1 and D2, muscarinic, GABA, histaminergic H1, serotonin 5-HT2, and N-methyl-D-aspartate). Inhibitory effects on 5-HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters are weak. Lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, but whether this effect is sufficient to contribute to a mechanism of action or increases risk to the fetus during pregnancy is not known. Early studies of lamotrigine's mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex slices in vitro. As is the case for antiepileptic drugs that act on voltage-dependent sodium channels, lamotrigine thereby inhibits the release of glutamate and aspartate, which is evoked by the sodium-channel activator veratrine and was less effective in the inhibition of acetylcholine or GABA release. At high concentrations, it did not affect spontaneous or potassium-evoked amino acid release. These studies suggested that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several electrophysiological studies have investigated the effects of lamotrigine on voltage-gated sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant in the treatment of human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These and a variety of other results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognized to be protective against generalized absence epilepsy and other generalized epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The basis for this broader spectrum of activity of lamotrigine is unknown but could relate to actions of the drug on voltage-gated calcium channels. Lamotrigine blocks T-type calcium channels weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high voltage-gated calcium channels (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on calcium channels accounts for lamotrigine's broader clinical spectrum of activity in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined. It antagonizes these receptors with the following IC50 values: 5-HT3, IC50 = 18 μM σ receptors, IC50 = 145 μM === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine follow first-order kinetics, with a half-life of 29 hours and volume of distribution of 1.36 L/kg. Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Its absolute bioavailability is 98% and its plasma Cmax occurs from 1.4 to 4.8 hours. Available data indicate that its bioavailability is not affected by food. Estimate of the mean apparent volume of distribution of lamotrigine following oral administration ranges from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. This is independent of dose and is similar to following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers. Lamotrigine is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver. Lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation. Its major metabolite is an inactive 2-n-glucuronide conjugate. Lamotrigine has fewer drug interactions than many anticonvulsant drugs, although pharmacokinetic interactions with carbamazepine, phenytoin and other hepatic enzyme-inducing medications may shorten half-life. Dose adjustments should be made on clinical response, but monitoring may be of benefit in assessing compliance. The capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences of melanin binding is unknown. Clinical trials excluded subtle effects and optimal duration of treatment. There are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring. Lamotrigine binds to the eye and melanin-containing tissues which can accumulate over time and may cause toxicity. Prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects and base treatment on clinical response. Patient compliance should be periodically reassessed with lab and medical testing of liver and kidney function to monitor progress or side effects. == Chemistry == The first synthesis of lamotrigine was disclosed in a patent file by the Wellcome Foundation in 1980. 2,3-Dichlorobenzoyl chloride is treated with cuprous cyanide to form an acyl cyanide. This is then reacted with the nitrate salt of aminoguanidine to give an intermediate which is cyclised to the diamino triazine of the drug product. == History == 1980 — initial patent filings are made by the Wellcome Foundation. 1990 — lamotrigine is approved for use in Ireland to treat epilepsy. 1991 — lamotrigine is used in the United Kingdom as an anticonvulsant medication December 1994 — lamotrigine was approved for use in the United States for the treatment of partial seizures. August 1998 — for use as adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in pediatric and adult patients, new dosage form: chewable dispersible tablets. December 1998 — for use as monotherapy for the treatment of partial seizures in adult patients when converting from a single enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug. January 2003 — for use as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in pediatric patients as young as two years of age. June 2003 — approved for maintenance treatment of bipolar II disorder; the first such medication since lithium. January 2004 — for use as monotherapy for the treatment of partial seizures in adult patients when converting from the anti-epileptic drug valproate (including valproic acid) == Society and culture == === Brand names === Lamotrigine is sold under the original brand name Lamictal and it is available in generic form under many brand names worldwide. == Regulatory advisory in 2021 == In March 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding the potential for cardiac arrhythmias in people with pre-existing structural or conduction heart defects. The warning provoked consternation and controversy within the professional community. An in-vitro study conducted in 2011 predicted Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutic concentrations of lamotrigine, due to its sodium channel-blocking activity. Thus, lamotrigine use in at-risk populations could prolong the QRS interval on the electrocardiogram, and increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death. No references to human studies or postmarket data in at-risk populations (i.e., people with structural heart disease) were cited to support the warning. A study in dogs is mentioned in the prescribing information brochure by the manufacturer. A rapid systematic review concluded that ""there is insufficient evidence to support or refute that lamotrigine is associated with sudden death or electrocardiogram changes..."" The FDA has recommended that further studies are conducted with lamotrigine and other sodium-channel blocking antiseizure medications. In March 2023, an FDA Adverse Event Reporting System analysis demonstrated signals of cardiac arrest, but not of tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia nor their clinical manifestation as fainting in lamotrigine. The study stratified the epileptic and psychiatric indications, explaining that the nature of the signal for cardiac arrest seems to be confounded by the psychiatric indication, which included 2.5 times more concomitant medications with cardiac adverse events, such as QT-prolonging drugs. Additionally, a 1.5-fold greater reports on overdose and suicide attempts was recorded in the psychiatric reports. Although lamotrigine blocks the cardiac sodium channels at therapeutically relevant concentrations, owing to its short-fast kinetics at the channel level, this blockage did not translate into a disproportional signal in this study. == Research == Though lamotrigine has been used to treat seizures in infants, as of 2023, its effectiveness in this age group has been evaluated in only one study. Adverse effects were rarely severe enough for the medication to be discontinued in this age group, however, its effectiveness in reducing seizures was inconclusive. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -5.5122365e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}

218	6-ketolithocholic acid	PUBMED	 3alpha-Hydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic (lithocholic) acid is a relatively minor component of hepatic bile acids in humans but is highly cytotoxic. Hepatic microsomal oxidation offers a potential mechanism for effective detoxification and elimination of bile acids. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biotransformation of lithocholic acid by human hepatic microsomes and to assess the contribution of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes in human hepatic microsomes using human recombinant P450 enzymes and chemical inhibitors. Metabolites were identified, and metabolite formation was quantified using a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based assay. Incubation of lithocholic acid with human liver microsomes resulted in the formation of five metabolites, which are listed in order of their rates of formation: 3-oxo-5 beta-cholan-24-oic (3-ketocholanoic) acid, 3 alpha,6 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic (hyodeoxycholic) acid, 3 alpha,7 beta-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic (ursodeoxycholic) acid, 3 alpha,6 beta-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic (murideoxycholic) acid, and 3 alpha-hydroxy-6-oxo-5 beta-cholan-24-oic (6-ketolithocholic) acid. 3-Ketocholanoic acid was the major metabolite, exhibiting apparent K(m) and V(max) values of 22 muM and 336 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Incubation of lithocholic acid with a of human recombinant P450 enzymes revealed that all five metabolites were formed by recombinant CYP3A4. Chemical inhibition studies with human liver microsomes and recombinant P450 enzymes confirmed that CYP3A4 was the predominant enzyme involved in hepatic microsomal biotransformation of lithocholic acid. In summary, the results indicate that oxidation of the third carbon of the cholestane ring is the preferred position of oxidation by P450 enzymes for lithocholic acid biotransformation in humans and suggest that formation of lithocholic acid metabolites leads to enhanced hepatic detoxification and elimination. Ruminococcus sp. PO1-3 from human intestinal flora reduced dehydrocholic acid to 3 beta-hydroxy-7,12-dioxo-5 beta-cholanic acid by means of the enzyme 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Akao, T., Akao, T., Hattori, M., Namba, T. and Kobashi, K. (1986) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 99, 1425-1431). This bacterium and its crude extract gave rise to another product, showing a lower RF value on TLC, from dehydrocholic acid. The product was identified as 3 beta, 7 beta-dihydroxy-12-oxo-5 beta-cholanic acid. The crude extract reduced 7-ketolithocholic acid and its methyl ester, but not 6-ketolithocholic acid and 12-ketochenodeoxycholic acid, in the presence of NADPH, and oxidized ursodeoxycholic acid and beta-muricholic acid, but not cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid and hydrocholic acid, in the presence of NADP+. Therefore, besides 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was shown to be present in this bacterium. The two dehydrogenases were clearly separated from each other by butyl-Toyopearl 650 M column chromatography. From dehydrocholic acid, 7 beta-hydroxy-3,12-dioxo-5 beta-cholanic acid was produced by 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3 beta, 7 beta-dihydroxy-12-oxo-5 beta-cholanic acid was produced by combination of two enzymes, 7 beta- and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Lithocholic acid is a lipid-soluble hepatotoxic bile acid that accumulates in the liver during cholestasis. A potential detoxification pathway for lithocholic acid involves hydroxylation by hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes. The purpose of the present study was to identify the hepatic microsomal metabolites of lithocholic acid by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and to determine the P450 enzymes involved. Incubation of lithocholic acid with rat hepatic microsomes and NADPH produced murideoxycholic acid (MDCA), isolithocholic acid (ILCA), and 3-keto-5beta-cholanic acid (3KCA) as major metabolites and 6-ketolithocholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid as minor metabolites. Experiments with hepatic microsomes prepared from rats pretreated with P450 inducers and with inhibitory antibodies indicated that CYP2C and CYP3A enzymes contribute to microsomal MDCA formation. Results obtained with a panel of recombinant P450 enzymes and CYP2D6 antiserum showed that CYP2D1 can also catalyze MDCA formation. Similar experimental evidence revealed that formation of 3KCA was mediated primarily by CYP3A enzymes. ILCA formation appeared to be catalyzed by a distinct pathway mediated largely by microsomal non-P450 enzymes. Based on the results obtained using lithocholic acid and 3KCA as substrates, a mechanism for the formation of ILCA involving a geminal diol intermediate is outlined. In conclusion, lithocholic acid was extensively metabolized by multiple P450 enzymes with the predominant biotransformation pathway being hydroxylation at the 6beta-position. This study provides an insight into possible routes of detoxification of lithocholic acid.	ENDOGENOUS	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': -7.3458323e-06, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
224	Pipernonaline	PUBMED	 The antiproliferation effects of pipernonaline, a piperine derivative, were investigated on human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. It inhibited growth of androgen independent PC-3 and androgen dependent LNCaP prostate cells in a dose-dependent (30-90 μM) and time-dependent (24-48 h) manner. The growth inhibition of PC-3 cells was associated with sub-G(1) and G(0)/G(1) accumulation, confirmed by the down-regulation of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, which are correlated with G(1) phase of cell cycle. Pipernonaline up-regulated cleavage of procaspase-3/PARP, but did not change expression of proapoptotic bax and antiapoptotic bcl-2 proteins. Its caspase-3 activation was confirmed by the caspase-3 assay kit. In addition, pipernonaline caused the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increase of intracellular Ca(2+), and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which these phenomena were reversed by N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger. The results suggest that pipernonaline exhibits apoptotic properties through ROS production, which causes disruption of mitochondrial function and Ca(2+) homeostasis and leads to its downstream events including activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP in PC-3 cells. This is the first report of pipernonaline toward the anticancer activity of prostate cancer cells, which provides a role for candidate agent as well as the molecular basis for human prostate cancer. Pipernonaline (1), one of the components of the spice pepper, preferentially reduced the survival of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells under nutrient-deprived conditions witha PC A methanol extract of Piper longum fruit was found to be active against mosquito larvae of Culex pipiens pallens at 10 microg/ml after 24 h. A piperidine alkaloid, pipernonaline, was found to be responsible for this activity, with the 24-h median lethal dose (LD50) value for this compound being 0.21 mg/liter. The LD50 value of pipernonaline was not much higher than those for the 3 organophosphorous insecticides malathion, chlorpyrifos-methyl, and pirimiphos-methyl, used for comparative purpose in this study. Structural elucidation of pipernonaline was by means of mass spectrometry (1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance imaging).

227	Dioctyl sulfosuccinate	PUBMED	 Constipation has many definitions and is often described differently depending on the population queried. Many physicians define constipation as a reduction in the frequency of bowel movements to fewer than three times per week while patients identify more with the symptoms associated with constipation such as difficulty passing stool, hard stool consistency, feelings of abdominal cramping, and feelings of incomplete stool passage. Causes of constipation may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to other factors such as diet, medication, or medical conditions. Constipation can affect anyone as a minor annoyance but up to a quarter of the population experiences it chronically or severely. It can substantially affect quality of life and be debilitating. It is estimated that between 2% to 27% of the population are affected depending upon the definition of constipation used. Chronic constipation is a significant problem in the elderly,, in patients with chronic conditions,– and in patients receiving opioids as part of a treatment regimen.– Up to 20% suffer from chronic constipation in the community-dwelling elderly population while this number increases to approximately 50% to 75% in institutionalized elderly patients. Approximately 90% of patients treated with opioids for non-cancer pain suffer from constipation with this number rising to 95% in patients treated for cancer pain. Chronic constipation can be defined using any one of three options: the Rome III criteria for functional constipation, the American College of Gastroenterology definition, or the American Gastroenterological Association definition. Current treatment options include dietary or bulking agents (i.e. psyllium seed husk), osmotic laxatives (i.e. lactulose, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol [PEG]), stimulant laxatives (i.e. sennosides, bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate), and stool softeners (i.e. docusate sodium or calcium)., In North America, docusate and a stimulant laxative such as sennosides are commonly used in bowel treatment protocols associated with institutionalized elderly and oncology treatments. A paucity of evidence is available to support the use of the stool softener docusate yet it continues to be prescribed in everyday clinical practice for the aforementioned populations.– While the actual cost of docusate is low, additional costs associated with its administration (i.e. nursing time) and its widespread use can be significant. Therefore, this review was undertaken to determine the clinical effectiveness of docusate for the prevention or management of constipation. Due to the relatively high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in oil samples, oil spills in aquatic ecosystems release significant amounts of PAHs. Although remediation efforts often take place during or immediately after an oil spill incident, a portion of the released PAHs remains in the body of water. A natural phenomenon resulting from the direct exposure of PAHs to sunlight is photodegradation. This article investigates the effect of dioctyl sulfosuccinate (DOSS) on the photodegradation of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), the most toxic PAH in the priority pollutants list of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). DOSS is a surfactant typically used in the remediation of oil spills. Three lamps with maximum emission wavelengths at 350 nm, 419 nm, and 575 nm were individually and simultaneously used to irradiate aqueous solutions of BaP in the absence and the presence of DOSS. When irradiated with the 419 nm lamp or the 575 lamp, BaP showed no photodegradation. Upon irradiation with the 350 nm lamp and with the simultaneous use of the three lamps, the photodegradation of BaP followed first-order kinetics. Independent of the irradiation wavelength, the presence of DOSS increased the half-life of BaP in the aqueous solution. In the case of the 350 nm lamp, the rate constant of photodegradation in the absence and the presence of DOSS varied from (3.79 ± 0.97) × 10 Reverse micelle (RM) aggregates have a wide range of applications in various areas of science and technology. A continuous demand exists to replace interfacial surfactant molecules with various nonconventional amphiphiles. Ionic liquid (IL)-like surfactants (IL-surf's) constitute a class of such molecules that are being researched extensively. Here, we have formulated several water/IL-surf/oil microemulsions by optimizing the core droplet size with varying oil phases. The best composition of water/[BMIM][AOT]/IPM ([BMIM][AOT]: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dioctyl sulfosuccinate; IPM: isopropyl myristate) was then analyzed in detail through experimental and computer simulations. Our results from DLS measurements suggest a structural transition from spherical aggregates in the parent water/[Na][AOT]/IPM solution to cylindrical droplets in the IL-surf-based system. The Raman and ATR-FTIR spectral analysis suggest a variation in the microstructure of the water/oil interface due to the differential interaction of the counterions with AOT headgroups and water. Molecular dynamics simulation results provided the direct image of the interface showing a structured versus uneven water/oil interface in [Na][AOT] versus [BMIM][AOT] RMs, where the larger [BMIM] cations weakly bind with the AOT headgroups due to their low charge density. Finally, an application of this IL-surf-based formulation was tested by carrying out a Heck cross-coupling reaction that showed significantly higher yield under milder reaction conditions.

229	Ferulic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Ferulic acid is a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative and a phenolic compound. It is an organic compound with the formula (CH3O)HOC6H3CH=CHCO2H. The name is derived from the genus Ferula, referring to the giant fennel (Ferula communis). Classified as a phenolic phytochemical, ferulic acid is an amber colored solid. Esters of ferulic acid are found in plant cell walls, covalently bonded to hemicellulose such as arabinoxylans. Salts and esters derived from ferulic acid are called ferulates. == Occurrence in nature == Ferulic acid is ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, including a number of vegetable sources. It occurs in particularly high concentrations in popcorn and bamboo shoots. It is a major metabolite of chlorogenic acids in humans along with caffeic and isoferulic acid, and is absorbed in the small intestine, whereas other metabolites such as dihydroferulic acid, feruloylglycine and dihydroferulic acid sulfate are produced from chlorogenic acid in the large intestine by the action of gut flora. In cereals, ferulic acid is localized in the bran – the hard outer layer of grain. In wheat, phenolic compounds are mainly found in the form of insoluble bound ferulic acid and may be relevant to resistance to wheat fungal diseases. The highest known concentration of ferulic acid glucoside has been found in flaxseed (4.1±0.2 g/kg). It is also found in barley grain. Asterid eudicot plants can also produce ferulic acid. The tea brewed from the leaves of yacón (Smallanthus sonchifolius), a plant traditionally grown in the northern and central Andes, contains quantities of ferulic acid. In legumes, the white bean variety navy bean is the richest source of ferulic acid among the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) varieties. It is also found in horse grams (Macrotyloma uniflorum). Although there are many sources of ferulic acid in nature, its bioavailability depends on the form in which it is present: free ferulic acid has limited solubility in water, and hence poor bioavailability. In wheat grain, ferulic acid is found bound to cell wall polysaccharides, allowing it to be released and absorbed in the small intestine. === In herbal medicines === Ferulic acid has been identified in Chinese medicine herbs such as Angelica sinensis (female ginseng), Cimicifuga heracleifolia and Ligusticum chuangxiong. It is also found in the tea brewed from the European centaury (Centaurium erythraea), a plant used as a medical herb in many parts of Europe. === In processed foods === Cooked sweetcorn releases increased levels of ferulic acid. As plant sterol esters, this compound is naturally found in rice bran oil, a popular cooking oil in several Asian countries. Ferulic acid glucoside can be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed. Rye bread contains ferulic acid dehydrodimers. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === Ferulic acid is biosynthesized in plants from caffeic acid by the action of the enzyme caffeate O-methyltransferase. In a proposed ferulic acid biosynthetic pathway for Escherichia coli, L-tyrosine is converted to 4-coumaric acid by tyrosine ammonia lyase, which is converted to caffeic acid by Sam5, which is then converted to ferulic acid by caffeic acid methyltransferase. Ferulic acid, together with dihydroferulic acid, is a component of lignocellulose, serving to crosslink the lignin and polysaccharides, thereby conferring rigidity to the cell walls. It is an intermediate in the synthesis of monolignols, the monomers of lignin, and is also used for the synthesis of lignans. === Biodegradation === Ferulic acid is converted by certain strains of yeast, notably strains used in brewing of wheat beers, such as Saccharomyces delbrueckii (Torulaspora delbrueckii), to 4-vinyl guaiacol (2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol) which gives beers such as Weissbier and Wit their distinctive clove-like flavour. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (dry baker's yeast) and Pseudomonas fluorescens are also able to convert trans-ferulic acid into 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol. In P. fluorescens, a ferulic acid decarboxylase has been isolated. == Ecology == Ferulic acid is one of the compounds that initiate the vir (virulence) region of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, inducing it to infect plant cells. == Extraction == It can be extracted from wheat bran and maize bran using concentrated alkali. == See also == Caffeic acid Coumaric acid Diferulic acids Eugenol Isoferulic acid, an isomer of ferulic acid == References ==	FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	{'FO': -0.0005283686, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -1.9361265e-07, ' PERSON': -0.0045609, 'AL': -1.9361265e-07, ' CARE': 0.0}
231	Guineensine	WIKIPEDIA	Guineesine (or guineensine) is a compound isolated from long pepper (Piper longum) and black pepper (Piper nigrum). It was first isolated, studied and named from Piper guineense. == Research == Guineensine inhibits the cellular reuptake of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in a mouse model (EC50 = 290 nM). This causes an increase in the activity of the two neurotransmitters which are classified as endogenous cannabinoids. Guineesine can dose-dependently produce cannabimimetic effects in a mouse model which are indicated by potent catatonic, analgesic, hypo-locomotive and hypo-thermic effects. In addition, the analgesic and catatonic effects were reversed by the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) inverse agonist rimonabant. Guineesine is also a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) in vitro (IC50 = 139.2 μM). == References ==	FOOD, MEDICAL	FOOD	{'FO': -0.0001309527, 'OD': 0.0}
233	Flufenamic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Flufenamic acid (FFA) is a member of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).: 718 Like other members of the class, it is a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, preventing the formation of prostaglandins. FFA is known to bind to and reduce the activity of prostaglandin F synthase and activate TRPC6. Scientists led by Claude Winder from Parke-Davis invented FFA in 1963, along with fellow members of the class, mefenamic acid in 1961 and meclofenamic acid in 1964.: 718 Although flufenamic acid was at one time informally referred to as ""Fluffy"" (see history cache), this pet name could also refer to flufenoxine. == Structure == Flufenamic acid is a highly polymorphic drug molecule with multiple structurally characterized polymorphic modifications. It has a unique chemical structure and stands out among fenamates. Nowadays, eight polymorphic forms are known that are determined by different conformers, which makes flufenamic acid unique among other low-molecular medicinal compounds. A fundamental feature of the structure of flufenamic acid, which has generated significant interest in the design and development of drugs, is the presence of a trifluoromethyl group. Compounds with fluorine-containing substituents are known to have promising chemical and biological properties, since such groups often improve the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of drugs. Studies have shown the promise of repositioning flufenamic acid and the use of drugs based on it in the treatment of Bartter syndrome. == Medical uses == Until recently, FFA was actively used in medical practice as an analgesic with anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects. FFA has been proven effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and other inflammation-related diseases. However, despite this, the use of FFA in the United States and other countries is limited since the compound causes frequent side effects. The rate of gastrointestinal side effects can be as high as 60%, manifested as at least one of the following: dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain and discomfort, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, indigestion, epigastric distress, stomatitits and anorexia. Besides gastrointestinal side effects, the drug can cause headache, dizziness and peripheral oedema. == Side effects == It is not widely used in humans as it has a high rate (30–60%) of gastrointestinal side effects. It is generally not available in the US. It is available in some Asian and European countries as a generic drug. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
234	Soyasaponin i	PUBMED	 Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) is a life-threatening disease and lacks effective treatments. Previous studies have confirmed that metabolic profiles altered after ischemic stroke, but how brain metabolism changes after HICH was unclear. This study aimed to explore the metabolic profiles after HICH and the therapeutic effects of soyasaponin I on HICH. HICH model was established first. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to estimate the pathological changes after HICH. Western blot and Evans blue extravasation assay were applied to determine the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Next, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-untargeted metabolomics was utilized to analyze the metabolic profiles of brain tissues after HICH. Finally, soyasaponin I was administered to HICH rats, and the severity of HICH and activation of the RAAS were further assessed. We successfully constructed HICH model. HICH significantly impaired BBB integrity and activated RAAS. HICH increased PE(14:0/24:1(15Z)), arachidonoyl serinol, PS(18:0/22:6(4Z, 7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z, and 19Z)), PS(20:1(11Z)/20:5(5Z, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z, and 17Z)), glucose 1-phosphate, etc., in the brain, whereas decreased creatine, tripamide, D-N-(carboxyacetyl)alanine, N-acetylaspartate, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, and so on in the hemorrhagic hemisphere. Cerebral soyasaponin I was found to be downregulated after HICH and supplementation of soyasaponin I inactivated the RAAS and alleviated HICH. The metabolic profiles of the brains changed after HICH. Soyasaponin I alleviated HICH via inhibiting the RAAS and may serve as an effective drug for the treatment of HICH in the future. One way to control hypertension is inactivation of the Renin- Angiotensin- Aldosterone System (RAAS). Inhibition of renin as a rate-limiting step of this system is an effective way to stop up RAAS. It has been proved that soyasaponin I, an herbal compound obtained from soybeans, has anti-hypertensive effect via renin inhibition, so it has the potential of being an anti-hypertensive drug. Herein, some theoretical approaches such as Docking Simulation, Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation and MMPBSA analysis have been used to study how soyasaponin I inhibits renin at the structural level. The results of docking simulation and hydrogen bond pattern show that this ligand is able to bind to the active site of renin and a region near the active site. Results of MD simulation for renin - soyasaponin I complexes confirm that soyasaponin I binds to the active site of renin and has inhibition effect on it via competing with the substrate. Besides, according to MMPBSA analysis, the binding free energy for renin - soyasaponin I complex is -42.61 kcal/mol when it binds to the active site. Comparing to the peptide obtained from angiotensinogen, ΔG = -74.96 kcal/mol, it may inferred that although binding of soyasaponin I to the active site of renin does not have a complete competition with the substrate, it might attenuate the formation of renin - angiotensinogen complex and have partial non-competitive effect. The results of this survey might be helpful to design partial non - competitive renin inhibitors with pharmaceutical capability. The metabolism of soyasaponin I (3-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]olean-12-ene-3beta,22beta,24-triol) by human fecal microorganisms was investigated. Fresh feces were collected from 15 healthy women and incubated anaerobically with 10 mmol soyasaponin I/g feces at 37 degrees C for 48 h. The disappearance of soyasaponin I in this in vitro fermentation system displayed apparent first-order rate loss kinetics. Two distinct soyasaponin I degradation phenotypes were observed among the subjects: rapid soyasaponin degraders with a rate constant k = 0.24 +/- 0.04 h(-)(1) and slow degraders with a k = 0.07 +/- 0.02 h(-)(1). There were no significant differences in the body mass index, fecal moisture, gut transit time, and soy consumption frequency between the two soyasaponin degradation phenotypes. Two primary gut microbial metabolites of soyasaponin I were identified as soyasaponin III (3-O-[beta-D-galactopyranosyl-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]olean-12-ene-3beta,22beta,24-triol) and soyasapogenol B (olean-12-ene-3beta,22beta,24-triol) by NMR and electrospray ionized mass spectroscopy. Soyasaponin III appeared within the first 24 h and disappeared by 48 h. Soyasapogenol B seemed to be the final metabolic product during the 48 h anaerobic incubation. These results indicate that dietary soyasaponins can be metabolized by human gut microorganisms. The sugar moieties of soyasaponins seem to be hydrolyzed sequentially to yield smaller and more hydrophobic metabolites.

239	Citalopram	WIKIPEDIA	"Citalopram, sold under the brand name Celexa among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia. The antidepressant effects may take one to four weeks to occur. It is typically taken orally (swallowed by mouth). In some European countries, it is sometimes given intravenously (injected into a vein) to initiate treatment, before switching to the oral route of administration for continuation of treatment. It has also been used intravenously in other parts of the world in some other circumstances. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, sexual problems, shakiness, feeling tired, and sweating. Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, glaucoma, and QT prolongation. It should not be used in persons who take or have recently taken an MAO inhibitor. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Citalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 40th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Depression === In the United States, citalopram is approved to treat major depressive disorder. Citalopram appears to have comparable efficacy and superior tolerability relative to other antidepressants. In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ranking of ten antidepressants for efficacy and cost-effectiveness, citalopram is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline) and fourth in cost-effectiveness. Evidence for the effectiveness of citalopram for treating depression in children is uncertain. === Panic disorder === Citalopram is licensed in the UK and other European countries for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. === Other === Citalopram may be used off-label to treat anxiety, and dysthymia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. It appears to be as effective as fluvoxamine and paroxetine in obsessive–compulsive disorder. Some data suggest the effectiveness of intravenous infusion of citalopram in resistant OCD. Citalopram is well tolerated and as effective as moclobemide in social anxiety disorder. There are studies suggesting that citalopram can be useful in reducing aggressive and impulsive behavior. It appears to be superior to placebo for behavioural disturbances associated with dementia. It has also been used successfully for hypersexuality in early Alzheimer's disease. A meta-analysis, including studies with fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram versus placebo, showed SSRIs to be effective in reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, whether taken continuously or just in the luteal phase. For alcoholism, citalopram has produced a modest reduction alcohol intake and increase in drink-free days in studies of alcoholics, possibly by decreasing desire or reducing the reward. While on its own citalopram is less effective than amitriptyline in the prevention of migraines, in refractory cases, combination therapy may be more effective. Citalopram and other SSRIs can be used to treat hot flashes.: 107 A 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in autistic children from citalopram, raising doubts about whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in children with autism. Some research suggests citalopram interacts with cannabinoid protein-couplings in the rat brain, and this is put forward as a potential cause of some of the drug's antidepressant effects. == Administration == Citalopram is typically taken in one dose, either in the morning or evening. It can be taken with or without food. Its absorption does not increase when taken with food, but doing so can help prevent nausea. Nausea is often caused when the 5-HT3 receptors actively absorb free serotonin, as this receptor is present within the digestive tract. == Adverse effects == Citalopram theoretically causes side effects by increasing the concentration of serotonin in other parts of the body (e.g., the intestines). Other side effects, such as increased apathy and emotional flattening, may be caused by the decrease in dopamine release associated with increased serotonin. Citalopram is also a mild antihistamine, which may be responsible for some of its sedating properties.: 104 Other common side effects of citalopram include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, hyperactivity and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime rather than in the morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares. Citalopram is associated with a higher risk of arrhythmia than other SSRIs. Citalopram and other SSRIs can induce a mixed state, especially in those with undiagnosed bipolar disorder.: 105 According to an article published in 2020, one of the other rare side effects of Citalopram could be triggering visual snow syndrome; which does not resolve after the discontinuation of the medicine. === Sexual dysfunction === Sexual dysfunction is often a side effect of SSRIs. Some people experience persistent sexual side effects when taking SSRIs or after discontinuing them. Symptoms of medication-induced sexual dysfunction from antidepressants include difficulty with orgasm, erection, or ejaculation. Other symptoms may be genital anesthesia, anhedonia, decreased libido, vaginal lubrication issues, and nipple insensitivity in women. Rates are unknown, and there is no established treatment. === Abnormal heart rhythm === In August 2011, the FDA announced, ""Citalopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. Citalopram should no longer be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day"". A further clarification, issued in March 2012, restricted the maximum dose to 20 mg for subgroups of patients, including those older than 60 years and those taking an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C19.7. === Endocrine effects === As with other SSRIs, citalopram can cause an increase in serum prolactin level. Citalopram has no significant effect on insulin sensitivity in women of reproductive age and no changes in glycaemic control were seen in another trial. === Exposure in pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including citalopram) during pregnancy is associated with shorter duration of gestation (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). Antidepressant exposure is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. It is uncertain whether there is an increased prevalence of septal heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed an SSRI in early pregnancy. === Overdose === Overdosage may result in vomiting, sedation, disturbances in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremors, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions.: 105 Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with citalopram as the sole agent. Citalopram and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma citalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 50-400 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000–3000 μg/L in patients who survive acute overdosage, and 3–30 mg/L in those who do not survive. It is the most dangerous of SSRIs in overdose. === Suicidality === In the United States, citalopram carries a boxed warning stating it may increase suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24. === Discontinuation Syndrome === SSRI discontinuation syndrome has been reported when treatment is stopped. It includes sensory, and gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, lethargy, and sleep disturbances, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety/agitation, irritability, and poor concentration. Electric shock-like sensations are typical for SSRI discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as paraesthesiae, sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems. Treatment with citalopram should be reduced gradually when treatment is finished. == Interactions == === Serotonin Syndrome === Citalopram should not be taken with St John's wort, tryptophan or 5-HTP as the resulting drug interaction could lead to serotonin syndrome. With St John's wort, this may be caused by compounds in the plant extract reducing the efficacy of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes that process citalopram. Tryptophan and 5-HTP are precursors to serotonin. When taken with an SSRI, such as citalopram, this can lead to levels of serotonin that can be lethal. This may also be the case when SSRIs are taken with SRAs (serotonin releasing agents) such as in the case of MDMA. It is possible that SSRIs could reduce the effects associated with an SRA since SSRIs stop the reuptake of Serotonin by blocking SERT. This would allow less serotonin in and out of the transporters, thus decreasing the likelihood of neurotoxic effects. However, these concerns are still disputed as the exact pharmacodynamic effects of citalopram and MDMA have yet to be fully identified. Citalopram is contraindicated in individuals taking MAOIs, owing to a potential for serotonin syndrome. === Other interactions === SSRIs, including citalopram, can increase the risk of bleeding, especially when coupled with aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants. Taking citalopram with omeprazole may cause higher blood levels of citalopram. This is a potentially dangerous interaction, so dosage adjustments may be needed or alternatives may be prescribed. == Pharmacokinetics == Citalopram is considered safe and well tolerated in the therapeutic dose range. Distinct from some other agents in its class, it exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interaction potential, making it a better choice for the elderly or comorbid patients. == Stereochemistry == Citalopram has one stereocenter, to which a 4-fluoro phenyl group and an N, N-dimethyl-3-aminopropyl group bind. As a result of this chirality, the molecule exists in (two) enantiomeric forms (mirror images). They are termed S-(+)-citalopram and R-(–)-citalopram. Citalopram is sold as a racemic mixture, consisting of 50% (R)-(−)-citalopram and 50% (S)-(+)-citalopram. Only the (S)-(+) enantiomer has the desired antidepressant effect. Lundbeck now markets the (S)-(+) enantiomer, the generic name of which is escitalopram. Whereas citalopram is supplied as the hydrobromide, escitalopram is sold as the oxalate salt (hydrooxalate). In both cases, the salt forms of the amine make these otherwise lipophilic compounds water-soluble. == Metabolism == Citalopram is metabolized in the liver mostly by CYP2C19, but also by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Metabolites desmethylcitalopram and didesmethylcitalopram are significantly less energetic and their contribution to the overall action of citalopram is negligible. The half-life of citalopram is about 35 hours. Approximately 80% is cleared by the liver and 20% by the kidneys. The elimination process is slower in the elderly and in patients with liver or kidney failure. With once-daily dosing, steady plasma concentrations are achieved in about a week. Potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 and 3A4 might decrease citalopram clearance. Tobacco smoke exposure was found to inhibit the biotransformation of citalopram in animals, suggesting that the elimination rate of citalopram is decreased after tobacco smoke exposure. After intragastric administration, the half-life of the racemic mixture of citalopram was increased by about 287%. == History == Citalopram was first synthesized in 1972 by chemist Klaus Bøgesø and his research group at the pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and was first marketed in 1989 in Denmark. It was first marketed in the US in 1998. The original patent expired in 2003, allowing other companies to legally produce and market generic versions. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Citalopram is sold under these brand names: === European Commission fine === On 19 June 2013, the European Commission imposed a fine of €93.8 million on the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck, plus a total of €52.2 million on several generic pharmaceutical-producing companies. This was in response to Lundbeck entering an agreement with the companies to delay their sales of generic citalopram after Lundbeck's patent on the drug had expired, thus reducing competition in breach of European antitrust law. == Other uses == Citalopram is also a parasiticide. Schistosomula have high mortality when treated with citalopram. == See also == List of antidepressants == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
243	Propranolol	WIKIPEDIA	"Propranolol is a medication of the beta blocker class. It is used to treat high blood pressure, some types of irregular heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, capillary hemangiomas, akathisia, performance anxiety, and essential tremors, as well to prevent migraine headaches, and to prevent further heart problems in those with angina or previous heart attacks. It can be taken orally or by intravenous injection. The formulation that is taken orally comes in short-acting and long-acting versions. Propranolol appears in the blood after 30 minutes and has a maximum effect between 60 and 90 minutes when taken orally. Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. It may worsen the symptoms of asthma. Propranolol may cause harmful effects for the baby if taken during pregnancy; however, its use during breastfeeding is generally considered to be safe. It is a non-selective beta blocker which works by blocking β-adrenergic receptors. Propranolol was patented in 1962 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Propranolol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 77th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Propranolol is used for treating various conditions, including: === Cardiovascular === Hypertension Angina pectoris (with the exception of variant angina) Myocardial infarction Tachycardia (and other sympathetic nervous system symptoms, such as muscle tremor) associated with various conditions, including anxiety, panic, hyperthyroidism, and lithium therapy Portal hypertension, to lower portal vein pressure Prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding and ascites Anxiety Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy While once a first-line treatment for hypertension, the role of beta blockers was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom to fourth-line, as they do not perform as well as other drugs, particularly in the elderly, and evidence is increasing that the most frequently used beta blockers at usual doses carry an unacceptable risk of provoking type 2 diabetes. Propranolol is not recommended for the treatment of high blood pressure by the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) because a higher rate of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to an angiotensin receptor blocker was noted in one study. === Psychiatric === Propranolol is occasionally used to treat performance anxiety, although evidence to support its use in any anxiety disorders is poor. Its efficacy in managing panic disorder appears similar to benzodiazepines, while carrying lower risks for addiction or abuse. Although beta-blockers such as propranolol have been suggested to be beneficial in managing physical symptoms of anxiety, its efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder remain unestablished. Some experimentation has been conducted in other psychiatric areas: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific phobias Aggressive behavior of patients with brain injuries Treating the excessive drinking of fluids in psychogenic polydipsia ==== PTSD and phobias ==== Propranolol is being investigated as a potential treatment for PTSD. Propranolol works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), a neurotransmitter that enhances memory consolidation. In one small study, individuals given propranolol immediately after trauma experienced fewer stress-related symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due to the fact that memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, propranolol can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as arachnophobia, dental fear, and social phobia. It has also been found to be helpful for some individuals with misophonia. Ethical and legal questions have been raised surrounding the use of propranolol-based medications for use as a ""memory damper"", including altering memory-recalled evidence during an investigation, modifying the behavioral response to past (albeit traumatic) experiences, the regulation of these drugs, and others. However, Hall and Carter have argued that many such objections are ""based on wildly exaggerated and unrealistic scenarios that ignore the limited action of propranolol in affecting memory, underplay the debilitating impact that PTSD has on those who suffer from it, and fail to acknowledge the extent to which drugs like alcohol are already used for this purpose"". === Other uses === Essential tremor. Evidence for use for akathisia however is insufficient Migraine and cluster headache prevention and in primary exertional headache Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) Infantile hemangioma Glaucoma Thyrotoxicosis by deiodinase inhibition Propranolol may be used to treat severe infantile hemangiomas (IHs). This treatment shows promise as being superior to corticosteroids when treating IHs. Extensive clinical case evidence and a small controlled trial support its efficacy. == Contraindications == Propranolol may be contraindicated in people with: Reversible airway diseases, particularly asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Slow heart rate (bradycardia) (<60 beats/minute) Sick sinus syndrome Atrioventricular block (second- or third-degree) Shock Severe low blood pressure == Adverse effects == Propranolol should be used with caution in people with: Diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism, since signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked Peripheral artery disease and Raynaud syndrome, which may be exacerbated Phaeochromocytoma, as hypertension may be aggravated without prior alpha blocker therapy Myasthenia gravis, which may be worsened Other drugs with bradycardic effects === Pregnancy and lactation === Propranolol, like other beta-blockers, is classified as pregnancy category C in the United States and ADEC category C in Australia. β-blocking agents in general reduce perfusion of the placenta, which may lead to adverse outcomes for the neonate, including lung or heart complications, or premature birth. The newborn may experience additional adverse effects such as low blood sugar and a slower than normal heart rate. Most β-blocking agents appear in the milk of lactating women. However, propranolol is highly bound to proteins in the bloodstream and is distributed into breast milk at very low levels. These low levels are not expected to pose any risk to the breastfeeding infant, and the American Academy of Pediatrics considers propranolol therapy ""generally compatible with breastfeeding."" == Overdose == In overdose, propranolol is associated with seizures. Cardiac arrest may occur in propranolol overdose due to sudden ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock which may ultimately culminate in bradycardic PEA. == Interactions == Since beta blockers are known to relax the cardiac muscle and constrict the smooth muscle, beta-adrenergic antagonists, including propranolol, have an additive effect with other drugs that decrease blood pressure or decrease cardiac contractility or conductivity. Clinically significant interactions particularly occur with: Verapamil Epinephrine (adrenaline) β2-adrenergic receptor agonists Salbutamol (albuterol), levosalbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, clenbuterol, others Clonidine Ergot alkaloids Isoprenaline (isoproterenol) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Quinidine Cimetidine Lidocaine Phenobarbital Rifampicin Fluvoxamine (slows down the metabolism of propranolol significantly, leading to increased blood levels of propranolol) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Propranolol is classified as a competitive non-cardioselective sympatholytic beta blocker that crosses the blood–brain barrier. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel-blocking effects. Propranolol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or beta blocker; that is, it blocks the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. It has little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, but has strong membrane stabilizing activity (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. overdose). Propranolol can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects in the central nervous system in addition to its peripheral activity. In addition to blockade of adrenergic receptors, propranolol has very weak inhibitory effects on the norepinephrine transporter and/or weakly stimulates norepinephrine release (i.e., the concentration of norepinephrine is increased in the synapse). Since propranolol blocks β-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic norepinephrine only results in α-adrenoceptor activation, with the α1-adrenoceptor being particularly important for effects observed in animal models. Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect α1-adrenoceptor agonist in addition to potent β-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition to its effects on the adrenergic system, there is evidence that indicates that propranolol may act as a weak antagonist of certain serotonin receptors, namely the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2B receptors. The latter may be involved in the effectiveness of propranolol in the treatment of migraine at high doses. Both enantiomers of propranolol have a local anesthetic (topical) effect, which is normally mediated by blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Studies have demonstrated propranolol's ability to block cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal voltage-gated sodium channels, accounting for its known membrane stabilizing effect and antiarrhythmic and other central nervous system effects. === Mechanism of action === Propranolol is a non-selective beta receptor antagonist. This means that it does not have preference to β1 or β2 receptors. It competes with sympathomimetic neurotransmitters for binding to receptors, which inhibits sympathetic stimulation of the heart. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β1 receptors on cardiac myocytes inhibits activation of adenylate cyclase, which in turn inhibits cAMP synthesis leading to reduced Protein kinase A (PKA) activation. This results in less calcium influx to cardiac myocytes through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels meaning there is a decreased sympathetic effect on cardiac cells, resulting in antihypertensive effects including reduced heart rate and lower arterial blood pressure. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β2 receptors on smooth muscle cells will increase contraction, which will increase hypertension. === Pharmacokinetics === Propranolol is rapidly and completely absorbed, with peak plasma levels achieved about 1–3 hours after ingestion. More than 90% of the drug is found bound to plasma protein in the blood. Coadministration with food appears to enhance bioavailability. Despite complete absorption, propranolol has a variable bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Hepatic impairment therefore increases its bioavailability. Propranolol can be absorbed along the whole intestine with the main absorption site being the colon, which means people who have lost their colon due to surgery may absorb relatively less percentage of propranolol. The main metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol, with a longer half-life (5.2–7.5 hours) than the parent compound (3–4 hours), is also pharmacologically active. Most of the metabolites are excreted in the urine. Propranolol is a highly lipophilic drug achieving high concentrations in the brain. The duration of action of a single oral dose is longer than the half-life and may be up to 12 hours if the single dose is high enough (e.g., 80 mg). Effective plasma concentrations are between 10 and 100 mg/L. Toxic levels are associated with plasma concentrations above 2000 mg/L. == History == Scottish scientist James W. Black developed propranolol in the 1960s. It was the first beta-blocker effectively used in the treatment of coronary artery disease and hypertension. Newer, more cardio-selective beta blockers (such as bisoprolol, nebivolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol) are used preferentially in the treatment of hypertension. == Society and culture == In a 1987 study by the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, it was reported that 27% of interviewed members said they used beta blockers such as propranolol for musical performances. For about 10–16% of performers, their degree of stage fright is considered pathological. Propranolol is used by musicians, actors, and public speakers for its ability to treat anxiety symptoms activated by the sympathetic nervous system. It has also been used as a performance-enhancing drug in sports where high accuracy is required, including archery, shooting, golf, and snooker. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, 50-metre pistol silver medalist and 10-metre air pistol bronze medalist Kim Jong-su tested positive for propranolol and was stripped of his medals. === Brand names === Propranolol was first marketed under the brand name Inderal, manufactured by ICI Pharmaceuticals (now AstraZeneca), in 1965. ""Inderal"" is a quasi-anagram of ""Alderlin"", the trade name of pronethalol (which propranolol replaced); both names are an homage to Alderley Park, the ICI headquarters where the drugs were first developed. Propranolol is also marketed under brand names Avlocardyl, Deralin, Dociton, Inderalici, InnoPran XL, Indoblok, Sumial, Anaprilin, and Bedranol SR (Sandoz). In India, it is marketed under brand names such as Ciplar and Ciplar LA by Cipla. Hemangeol, a 4.28 mg/mL solution of propranolol, is indicated for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma. == References == == Further reading == Stapleton MP (1997).

245	Cyclizine	WIKIPEDIA	"Cyclizine, sold under a number of brand names, is a medication used to treat and prevent nausea, vomiting and dizziness due to motion sickness or vertigo. It may also be used for nausea after general anaesthesia or that which developed from opioid use. It is taken by mouth, in the rectum, or injected into a vein. Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, constipation, and trouble with vision. More serious side effects include low blood pressure and urinary retention. It is not generally recommended in young children or those with glaucoma. Cyclizine appears to be safe during pregnancy but has not been well studied. It is in the anticholinergic and antihistamine family of medications. Cyclizine was discovered in 1947. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States it is available over the counter. == Medical uses == Primary uses include nausea, vomiting and dizziness associated with motion sickness, vertigo and post-operatively following administration of general anesthesia and opioids. It is sometimes given in hyperemesis gravidarum, although the manufacturer advises that it be avoided in pregnancy. Off-license use often occurs with specialists in hospitals to treat inpatients who have become severely dehydrated in pregnancy. An off-label use is as an opioid/opiate potentiator. The drug Diconal is a combination of cyclizine and the opioid dipipanone. Dipipanone is a schedule I controlled substance in the US. == Contraindications == Its antimuscarinic action warrants caution in patients with prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, or angle-closure glaucoma. Liver disease exacerbates its sedative effects. == Adverse effects == Common (over 10%) — Drowsiness, dry mouth. Uncommon (1% to 10%) — Headache, psychomotor impairment, dermatitis, and antimuscarinic effects such as diplopia (double vision), tachycardia, constipation, urinary retention and gastro-intestinal disturbances. Rare (less than 1%) — Hypersensitivity reactions (bronchospasm, angioedema, anaphylaxis, rashes and photosensitivity reactions), extrapyramidal effects, dizziness, confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, tremor, liver dysfunction, and hallucinations. == Pharmacology == Cyclizine is a piperazine derivative with histamine H1-receptor antagonist (antihistamine) activity. The precise mechanism of action in inhibiting the symptoms of motion sickness is not well understood. It may have effects directly on the vestibular system and on the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Cyclizine exerts a central anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) action. == Synthesis == Cyclizine may be prepared by the Eschweiler–Clarke methylation of diphenylmethylpiperazine or by reaction of benzhydryl bromide with 1-methylpiperazine in acetonitrile to form the hydrobromide salt of the drug. == History == Cyclizine was developed in the American division of pharmacy company Burroughs Wellcome (today GlaxoSmithKline) during a research study involving many drugs of the antihistamine group. Cyclizine was quickly clinically found as a potent and long-acting antiemetic. The company named the substance – or more precisely cyclizine's hydrochloride form which it usually appears in – ""marezine hydrochloride"" and started to sell it in the United States under trade name Marezine. Selling was begun in France under trade name Marzine in 1965. The substance received more credit when NASA chose it as a space antiemetic for the first crewed Moon flight. Cyclizine was introduced to many countries as a common antiemetic. It is an over-the-counter drug in many countries because it has been well tolerated, although it has not been studied much. == Society and culture == Some people using methadone recreationally combine cyclizine with their methadone dose, a combination that is known to produce strong psychoactive effects. It has also been used recreationally for its anticholinergic effects to induce hallucinations. It has been used illegally in greyhound racing to sabotage a dog's performance. === Names === As cyclizine hydrochloride tablets and cyclizine lactate solution for intramuscular or intravenous injection (brand names: Valoid in UK and South Africa and Marezine, Marzine and Emoquil in US). Cyclizine was marketed as Bonine for Kids in the US, but was discontinued in 2012, and replaced with meclizine. == Cyclizine derivatives == == See also == Cinnarizine == References == == External links == ""Cyclizine"".

246	Aspartame	WIKIPEDIA	"Aspartame is an artificial non-saccharide sweetener 200 times sweeter than sucrose and is commonly used as a sugar substitute in foods and beverages. It is a methyl ester of the aspartic acid/phenylalanine dipeptide with brand names NutraSweet, Equal, and Canderel. Aspartame was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1974, and then again in 1981, after approval was revoked in 1980. Aspartame is one of the most studied food additives in the human food supply. Reviews by over 100 governmental regulatory bodies found the ingredient safe for consumption at the normal acceptable daily intake limit. == Uses == Aspartame is about 180 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar). Due to this property, even though aspartame produces roughly the same energy per gram when metabolized as sucrose does, 4 kcal (17 kJ), the quantity of aspartame needed to produce the same sweetness is so small that its caloric contribution is negligible. The sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than that of sucrose, so it is often blended with other artificial sweeteners such as acesulfame potassium to produce an overall taste more like that of sugar. Like many other peptides, aspartame may hydrolyze (break down) into its constituent amino acids under conditions of elevated temperature or high pH. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in maltodextrin. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on pH. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its half-life is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its half-life is only a few days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as syrups for fountain beverages, aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as saccharin. Descriptive analyses of solutions containing aspartame report a sweet aftertaste as well as bitter and off-flavor aftertastes. == Acceptable levels of consumption == The acceptable daily intake (ADI) value for food additives, including aspartame, is defined as the ""amount of a food additive, expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk"". The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food (later becoming EFSA) have determined this value is 40 mg/kg of body weight per day for aspartame, while the FDA has set its ADI for aspartame at 50 mg/kg per day – an amount equated to consuming 75 packets of commercial aspartame sweetener per day to be within a safe upper limit. The primary source for exposure to aspartame in the US is diet soft drinks, though it can be consumed in other products, such as pharmaceutical preparations, fruit drinks, and chewing gum among others in smaller quantities. A 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml; 12 imp fl oz) can of diet soda contains 0.18 grams (0.0063 oz) of aspartame, and, for a 75-kilogram (165 lb) adult, it takes approximately 21 cans of diet soda daily to consume the 3.7 grams (0.13 oz) of aspartame that would surpass the FDA's 50 mg/kg of body weight ADI of aspartame from diet soda alone. Reviews have analyzed studies which have looked at the consumption of aspartame in countries worldwide, including the US, countries in Europe, and Australia, among others. These reviews have found that even the high levels of intake of aspartame, studied across multiple countries and different methods of measuring aspartame consumption, are well below the ADI for safe consumption of aspartame. Reviews have also found that populations that are believed to be especially high consumers of aspartame, such as children and diabetics, are below the ADI for safe consumption, even considering extreme worst-case scenario calculations of consumption. In a report released on 10 December 2013, the EFSA said that, after an extensive examination of evidence, it ruled out the ""potential risk of aspartame causing damage to genes and inducing cancer"" and deemed the amount found in diet sodas safe to consume. == Safety and health effects == The safety of aspartame has been studied since its discovery, and it is a rigorously tested food ingredient. Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by over 100 regulatory agencies in their respective countries, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), UK Food Standards Agency, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Health Canada, and Food Standards Australia New Zealand. === Metabolism and body weight === As of 2017, reviews of clinical trials showed that using aspartame (or other non-nutritive sweeteners) in place of sugar reduces calorie intake and body weight in adults and children. A 2017 review of metabolic effects by consuming aspartame found that it did not affect blood glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, calorie intake, or body weight. While high-density lipoprotein levels were higher compared to control, they were lower compared to sucrose. In 2023, the World Health Organization recommended against the use of common non-sugar sweeteners (NSS), including aspartame, to control body weight or lower the risk of non-communicable diseases, stating: ""The recommendation is based on the findings of a systematic review of the available evidence which suggests that use of NSS does not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat in adults or children. Results of the review also suggest that there may be potential undesirable effects from long-term use of NSS, such as an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality in adults."" === Phenylalanine === High levels of the naturally occurring essential amino acid phenylalanine are a health hazard to those born with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disease that prevents phenylalanine from being properly metabolized. Because aspartame contains phenylalanine, foods containing aspartame sold in the US must state: ""Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine"" on product labels. In the UK, foods that contain aspartame are required by the Food Standards Agency to list the substance as an ingredient, with the warning ""Contains a source of phenylalanine"". Manufacturers are also required to print ""with sweetener(s)"" on the label close to the main product name on foods that contain ""sweeteners such as aspartame"" or ""with sugar and sweetener(s)"" on ""foods that contain both sugar and sweetener"". In Canada, foods that contain aspartame are required to list aspartame among the ingredients, include the amount of aspartame per serving, and state that the product contains phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is one of the essential amino acids and is required for normal growth and maintenance of life. Concerns about the safety of phenylalanine from aspartame for those without phenylketonuria center largely on hypothetical changes in neurotransmitter levels as well as ratios of neurotransmitters to each other in the blood and brain that could lead to neurological symptoms. Reviews of the literature have found no consistent findings to support such concerns, and, while high doses of aspartame consumption may have some biochemical effects, these effects are not seen in toxicity studies to suggest aspartame can adversely affect neuronal function. As with methanol and aspartic acid, common foods in the typical diet, such as milk, meat, and fruits, will lead to ingestion of significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine than would be expected from aspartame consumption. === Cancer === As of 2023, regulatory agencies, including the FDA and EFSA, and the US National Cancer Institute, have concluded that consuming aspartame is safe in amounts within acceptable daily intake levels and does not cause cancer. These conclusions are based on various sources of evidence, such as reviews and epidemiological studies finding no association between aspartame and cancer. In July 2023, scientists for the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that there was ""limited evidence"" for aspartame causing cancer in humans, classifying the sweetener as Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic). The lead investigator of the IARC report stated that the classification ""shouldn't really be taken as a direct statement that indicates that there is a known cancer hazard from consuming aspartame. This is really more of a call to the research community to try to better clarify and understand the carcinogenic hazard that may or may not be posed by aspartame consumption."" The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) added that the limited cancer assessment indicated no reason to change the recommended acceptable daily intake level of 40 mg per kg of body weight per day, reaffirming the safety of consuming aspartame within this limit. The FDA responded to the report by stating: Aspartame being labeled by IARC as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" does not mean that aspartame is actually linked to cancer. The FDA disagrees with IARC's conclusion that these studies support classifying aspartame as a possible carcinogen to humans. FDA scientists reviewed the scientific information included in IARC's review in 2021 when it was first made available and identified significant shortcomings in the studies on which IARC relied. === Neurological safety === Reviews found no evidence that low doses of aspartame had neurotoxic effects. A 2019 policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that there were no safety concerns about aspartame in fetal or childhood development or as a factor in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. === Headaches === Reviews have found little evidence to indicate that aspartame induces headaches, although certain subsets of consumers may be sensitive to it. === Water quality === Aspartame passes through wastewater treatment plants mainly unchanged. == Mechanism of action == The perceived sweetness of aspartame (and other sweet substances like acesulfame potassium) in humans is due to its binding of the heterodimer G protein-coupled receptor formed by the proteins TAS1R2 and TAS1R3. Rodents do not experience aspartame as sweet-tasting, due to differences in their taste receptors. === Metabolites === Aspartame is rapidly hydrolyzed in the small intestine by digestive enzymes which break aspartame down into methanol, phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and further metabolites, such as formaldehyde and formic acid. Due to its rapid and complete metabolism, aspartame is not found in circulating blood, even following ingestion of high doses over 200 mg/kg. ==== Aspartic acid ==== Aspartic acid (aspartate) is one of the most common amino acids in the typical diet. As with methanol and phenylalanine, intake of aspartic acid from aspartame is less than would be expected from other dietary sources. At the 90th percentile of intake, aspartame provides only between 1% and 2% of the daily intake of aspartic acid. ==== Methanol ==== The methanol produced by aspartame metabolism is unlikely to be a safety concern for several reasons. The amount of methanol produced from aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages is likely to be less than that from food sources already in diets. With regard to formaldehyde, it is rapidly converted in the body, and the amounts of formaldehyde from the metabolism of aspartame are trivial when compared to the amounts produced routinely by the human body and from other foods and drugs. At the highest expected human doses of consumption of aspartame, there are no increased blood levels of methanol or formic acid, and ingesting aspartame at the 90th percentile of intake would produce 25 times less methanol than what would be considered toxic. == Chemistry == Aspartame is a methyl ester of the dipeptide of the natural amino acids L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine. Under strongly acidic or alkaline conditions, aspartame may generate methanol by hydrolysis. Under more severe conditions, the peptide bonds are also hydrolyzed, resulting in free amino acids. Two approaches to synthesis are used commercially. In the chemical synthesis, the two carboxyl groups of aspartic acid are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is protected with a formyl group as the formamide, by treatment of aspartic acid with a mixture of formic acid and acetic anhydride. Phenylalanine is converted to its methyl ester and combined with the N-formyl aspartic anhydride; then the protecting group is removed from aspartic nitrogen by acid hydrolysis. The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter-tasting β-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from aspartic acid anhydride links to phenylalanine, with desired and undesired isomer forming in a 4:1 ratio. A process using an enzyme from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the β-form byproduct. A variant of this method, which has not been used commercially, uses unmodified aspartic acid but produces low yields. Methods for directly producing aspartyl-phenylalanine by enzymatic means, followed by chemical methylation, have also been tried but not scaled for industrial production. == History == Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Company. Schlatter had synthesized aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone gastrin, for use in assessing an anti-ulcer drug candidate. He discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift up a piece of paper. Torunn Atteraas Garin participated in the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. In 1975, prompted by issues regarding Flagyl and Aldactone, an FDA task force team reviewed 25 studies submitted by the manufacturer, including 11 on aspartame. The team reported ""serious deficiencies in Searle's operations and practices"". The FDA sought to authenticate 15 of the submitted studies against the supporting data. In 1979, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) concluded, since many problems with the aspartame studies were minor and did not affect the conclusions, the studies could be used to assess aspartame's safety. In 1980, the FDA convened a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) consisting of independent advisors charged with examining the purported relationship between aspartame and brain cancer. The PBOI concluded aspartame does not cause brain damage, but it recommended against approving aspartame at that time, citing unanswered questions about cancer in laboratory rats.: 94–96 In 1983, the FDA approved aspartame for use in carbonated beverages and for use in other beverages, baked goods, and confections in 1993. In 1996, the FDA removed all restrictions from aspartame, allowing it to be used in all foods. As of May 2023, the FDA stated that it regards aspartame as a safe food ingredient when consumed within the acceptable daily intake level of 50 mg per kg of body weight per day. Several European Union countries approved aspartame in the 1980s, with EU-wide approval in 1994. The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) reviewed subsequent safety studies and reaffirmed the approval in 2002. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported in 2006 that the previously established Acceptable daily intake (ADI) was appropriate, after reviewing yet another set of studies. === Compendial status === British Pharmacopoeia United States Pharmacopeia == Commercial uses == Under the brand names Equal, NutraSweet, and Canderel, aspartame is an ingredient in approximately 6,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide, including (but not limited to) diet sodas and other soft drinks, instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatin desserts, juices, laxatives, chewable vitamin supplements, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners, teas, instant coffees, topping mixes, wine coolers, and yogurt. It is provided as a table condiment in some countries. Aspartame is less suitable for baking than other sweeteners because it breaks down when heated and loses much of its sweetness. === NutraSweet Company === In 1985, Monsanto bought G.D. Searle, and the aspartame business became a separate Monsanto subsidiary, NutraSweet. In March 2000, Monsanto sold it to J.W. Childs Associates Equity Partners II L.P. European use patents on aspartame expired beginning in 1987, with the US patent following suit in 1992. === Ajinomoto === In 2004, the market for aspartame, in which Ajinomoto, the world's largest aspartame manufacturer, had a 40% share, was 14,000 metric tons (15,000 short tons; 14,000 long tons) a year, and consumption of the product was rising by 2% a year. Ajinomoto acquired its aspartame business in 2000 from Monsanto for $67 million (equivalent to $113 million in 2023). In 2007, Asda was the first British supermarket chain to remove all artificial flavourings and colours in its store brand foods. In 2008, Ajinomoto sued Asda, part of Walmart, for a malicious falsehood action concerning its aspartame product when the substance was listed as excluded from the chain's product line, along with other ""nasties"". In July 2009, a British court ruled in favor of Asda. In June 2010, an appeals court reversed the decision, allowing Ajinomoto to pursue a case against Asda to protect aspartame's reputation. Asda said that it would continue to use the term ""no nasties"" on its own-label products, but the suit was settled in 2011 with Asda choosing to remove references to aspartame from its packaging. In November 2009, Ajinomoto announced a new brand name for its aspartame sweetener — AminoSweet. === Holland Sweetener Company === A joint venture of DSM and Tosoh, the Holland Sweetener Company manufactured aspartame using the enzymatic process developed by Toyo Soda (Tosoh) and sold as the brand Sanecta. Additionally, they developed a combination aspartame-acesulfame salt under the brand name Twinsweet. They left the sweetener industry in 2006, because ""global aspartame markets are facing structural oversupply, which has caused worldwide strong price erosion over the last five years"", making the business ""persistently unprofitable"". === Competing products === Because sucralose, unlike aspartame, retains its sweetness after being heated, and has at least twice the shelf life of aspartame, it has become more popular as an ingredient. This, along with differences in marketing and changing consumer preferences, caused aspartame to lose market share to sucralose. In 2004, aspartame traded at about $30 per kilogram ($14/lb) and sucralose, which is roughly three times sweeter by weight, at around $300 per kilogram ($140/lb). == See also == Sugar substitute == References == == External links == Media related to Aspartame at Wikimedia Commons"	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -1.147242e-06, 'OD': 0.0}
248	Procyanidin b2	PUBMED	 Apoptosis is a critical event in the pathogenesis of lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), an important deacetylase predominantly localized in mitochondria, regulates diverse physiological processes, including apoptosis. However, the detailed mechanisms by which SIRT3 regulates lung I/R injury remain unclear. Many polyphenols strongly regulate the sirtuin family. In this study, we found that a polyphenol compound, procyanidin B2 (PCB2), activated SIRT3 in mouse lungs. Due to this effect, PCB2 administration attenuated histological lesions, relieved pulmonary dysfunction, and improved the survival rate of the murine model of lung I/R injury. Additionally, this treatment inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced A549 cell apoptosis and rescued Bcl-2 expression. Using Sirt3-knockout mice and specific SIRT3 knockdown in vitro, we further found that SIRT3 strongly protects against lung I/R injury. Sirt3 deficiency or enzymatic inactivation substantially aggravated lung I/R-induced pulmonary lesions, promoted apoptosis, and abolished PCB2-mediated protection. Mitochondrial pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) inhibits apoptosis by stabilizing Bcl-2. Here, we found that PKM2 accumulates and is hyperacetylated in mitochondria upon lung I/R injury. By screening the potential sites of PKM2 acetylation, we found that SIRT3 deacetylates the K433 residue of PKM2 in A549 cells. Transfection with a deacetylated mimic plasmid of PKM2 noticeably reduced apoptosis, while acetylated mimic transfection abolished the protective effect of PKM2. Furthermore, PKM2 knockdown or inhibition in vivo significantly abrogated the antiapoptotic effects of SIRT3 upregulation. Collectively, this study provides the first evidence that the SIRT3/PKM2 pathway is a protective target for the suppression of apoptosis in lung I/R injury. Moreover, this study identifies K433 deacetylation of PKM2 as a novel modification that regulates its anti-apoptotic activity. In addition, PCB2-mediated modulation of the SIRT3/PKM2 pathway may significantly protect against lung I/R injury, suggesting a novel prophylactic strategy for lung I/R injury. Natural edible pigments play a paramount part in the food industry. Procyanidin B2 (PB2), one of the most representative naturally occurring edible pigments, is usually isolated from the seeds, fruits, and leaves of lots of common plants, such as grapes, Hawthorn, black soybean, as well as blueberry, and functions as a food additive in daily life. Notably, PB2 has numerous bioactivities and possesses the potential to treat/prevent a wide range of human diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, diabetic complications, atherosclerosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and the underlying mechanisms were partially elucidated, including mediating signaling pathways like NF-κB, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, apoptotic axis, and Nrf-2/HO-1. This paper presents a review of the natural sources, bioactivities, and the therapeutic/preventive potential of PB2 and the possible mechanisms, with the aim of promoting the development of PB2 as a functional food and providing references for its clinical application in the treatment of diseases. Metabolic balance is essential for oocyte maturation and acquisition of developmental capacity. Suboptimal conditions of in vitro cultures would lead to lipid accumulation and finally result in disrupted oocyte metabolism. However, the effect and mechanism underlying lipid catabolism in oocyte development remain elusive currently. In the present study, we observed enhanced developmental capacity in Procyanidin B2 (PCB2) treated oocytes during in vitro maturation. Meanwhile, reduced oxidative stress and declined apoptosis were found in oocytes after PCB2 treatment. Further studies confirmed that oocytes treated with PCB2 preferred to lipids catabolism, leading to a notable decrease in lipid accumulation. Subsequent analyses revealed that mitochondrial uncoupling was involved in lipid catabolism, and suppression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) would abrogate the elevated lipid consumption mediated by PCB2. Notably, we identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) as a potential target of PCB2 by docking analysis. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that PCB2 improved oocyte development capacity and attenuated oxidative stress by activating PPARγ mediated mitochondrial uncoupling. Our findings identify that PCB2 intricately improves oocyte development capacity through targeted activation of the PPARγ/UCP1 pathway, fostering uncoupling lipid catabolism while concurrently mitigating oxidative stress.

254	Cirsimaritin	PUBMED	 The search for natural plant-based products as new pharmacological alternatives to treat various human pathologies has taken on great importance for researchers and research laboratories. In this context, research has intensified to extract and identify natural molecules endowed with biological effects. The objective of this study is to review the source and pharmacological properties of cirsimaritin. The identification and isolation of this flavonoid from various natural sources, including medicinal plants such as  Cirsimaritin is a dimethoxy flavon that has different biological activities such as antiproliferative, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities. This study aims to investigate the anti-diabetic effects of cirsimaritin in a high-fat diet and streptozotocin-(HFD/STZ)-induced rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Rats were fed HFD, followed by a single low dose of STZ (40 mg/kg). HFD/STZ diabetic rats were treated orally with cirsimaritin (50 mg/kg) or metformin (200 mg/kg) for 10 days before terminating the experiment and collecting plasma, soleus muscle, adipose tissue, and liver for further downstream analysis. Cirsimaritin reduced the elevated levels of serum glucose in diabetic rats compared to the vehicle control group ( Cirsimaritin is a dimethoxy flavone, which is present in 	MEDICAL, FOOD	FOOD, MEDICAL	{'FO': -0.1322204, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -0.1952109, ' MED': -0.0083125485, 'ICAL': -1.9361265e-07}
259	Escitalopram	WIKIPEDIA	"Escitalopram, sold under the brand names Lexapro and Cipralex, among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. Escitalopram is mainly used to treat major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. It is taken by mouth, available commercially as an oxalate salt exclusively. Common side effects include headache, nausea, sexual problems, mild sedation, and trouble sleeping. More serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts in people up to the age of 24 years. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Escitalopram is the (S)-enantiomer of citalopram (which exists as a racemate), hence the name es-citalopram. Escitalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. Escitalopram is rarely replaced by twice the dose of citalopram; escitalopram is safer and more effective. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the fifteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 30 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == Escitalopram is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents and adults, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. In European countries including the United Kingdom, it is approved for depression and anxiety disorders; these include: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. In Australia it is approved for major depressive disorder. === Depression === Escitalopram is among the most effective and well-tolerated antidepressants for the short-term treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. It is also the safest one to give to children and adolescents. Controversy existed regarding the effectiveness of escitalopram compared with its predecessor, citalopram. The importance of this issue followed from the greater cost of escitalopram relative to the generic mixture of isomers of citalopram, prior to the expiration of the escitalopram patent in 2012, which led to charges of evergreening. Accordingly, this issue has been examined in at least 10 different systematic reviews and meta analyses. As of 2012, reviews had concluded (with caveats in some cases) that escitalopram is modestly superior to citalopram in efficacy and tolerability. === Anxiety disorders === Escitalopram appears to be effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder, with relapse on escitalopram at 20% rather than placebo at 50%, which translates to a number needed to treat of 3.33. Escitalopram appears effective in treating social anxiety disorder as well. === Other === Escitalopram is effective in reducing the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), whether taken continuously or in the luteal phase only. == Side effects == Escitalopram, like other SSRIs, has been shown to affect sexual function, causing side effects such as decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, and anorgasmia. There is also evidence that SSRIs is correlated with an increase in suicidal ideation. An analysis conducted by the FDA found a statistically insignificant 1.5 to 2.4-fold (depending on the statistical technique used) increase of suicidality among the adults treated with escitalopram for psychiatric indications. The authors of a related study note the general problem with statistical approaches: due to the rarity of suicidal events in clinical trials, it is hard to draw firm conclusions with a sample smaller than two million patients. Citalopram and escitalopram are associated with a mild dose-dependent QT interval prolongation, which is a measure of how rapidly the heart muscle repolarizes after each heartbeat. Prolongation of the QT interval is a risk factor for torsades de pointes (TdP), a heart rhythm disturbance that is sometimes fatal. Despite the observed change in the QT interval, the risk of TdP from escitalopram appears to be quite low, and it is similar to other antidepressants that are not known to affect the QT interval. A 2013 review discusses several reasons to be optimistic about the safety of escitalopram. It references a crossover study in which 113 subjects were each given four different treatments in randomized order: placebo, 10 mg/day escitalopram, 30 mg/day escitalopram, or 400 mg/day moxifloxacin (a positive control known to cause QTc prolongation). At 10 mg/day, escitalopram increased the QTc interval by 4.5 milliseconds (ms). At 30 mg/day, the QTc increased by 10.7 ms. A QTc increase of less than 60 ms is not likely to confer significant risk. The 30 mg/day escitalopram dose induced significantly less QTc prolongation than a therapeutically equivalent 60 mg/day dose of citalopram, which increased the QTc interval by 18.5 ms. More data about the cardiac risk from escitalopram can be found in a large observational study from Sweden that took note of all the medications used by all the patients presenting with TdP, and found the incidence of TdP in escitalopram users to be only 0.7 cases of TdP for every 100,000 patients who took the drug (ages 18-64), and only 4.1 cases of TdP for every 100,000 elderly patients who took the drug (ages 65 and up). Of the 9 antidepressants that were used by patients with TdP, escitalopram ranked 7th by TdP incidence in elderly patients (only venlafaxine and amitriptyline had less risk), and it ranked 5th of 9 by TdP incidence in patients ages 18-64. Antidepressants as a class had a relatively low risk of TdP, and most patients on an antidepressant who experienced TdP were also taking another drug that prolonged QT interval. Specifically, 80% of the escitalopram users who experienced TdP were taking at least one other drug known to cause TdP. For comparison, the most popular antiarrhythmic drug in the study was sotalol with 52,750 users, and sotalol had a TdP incidence of 81.1 cases and 41.2 cases of TdP per 100,000 users in the ≥65 and 18-64-year-old demographics, respectively. Drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as escitalopram, should be used with caution in those with congenital long QT syndrome or known pre-existing QT interval prolongation, or in combination with other medicines that prolong the QT interval. ECG measurements should be considered for patients with cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances should be corrected before starting treatment. In December 2011, the UK implemented new restrictions on the maximum daily doses at 20 mg for adults and 10 mg for those older than 65 years or with liver impairment. The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada did not similarly order restrictions on escitalopram dosage, only on its predecessor citalopram. Like other SSRIs, escitalopram has also been reported to cause hyponatremia (low sodium levels), with rates ranging from 0.5 to 32%, which can often be attributed to SIADH. This is typically not dose-dependent and at higher risk for occurrence within the first few weeks of starting treatment. === Very common effects === Very common effects (>10% incidence) include: Headache (24%) Nausea (18%) Ejaculation disorder (9–14%) Somnolence (4–13%) Insomnia (7–12%) === Common (1–10% incidence) === Common effects (1–10% incidence) include: === Psychomotor effects === The most common effect is fatigue or somnolence, particularly in older adults, although patients with pre-existing daytime sleepiness and fatigue may experience paradoxical improvement of these symptoms. Escitalopram has not been shown to affect serial reaction time, logical reasoning, serial subtraction, multitasking, or Mackworth Clock task performance. === Sexual dysfunction === Some people experience persistent sexual side effects when taking SSRIs or after discontinuing them. Symptoms of medication-induced sexual dysfunction from antidepressants include difficulty with orgasm, erection, or ejaculation. Other symptoms may be genital anesthesia, anhedonia, decreased libido, vaginal lubrication issues, and nipple insensitivity in women. Rates are unknown, and there is no established treatment. === Pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including escitalopram) is associated with shorter duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). Antidepressant exposure is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. There is a tentative association of SSRI use during pregnancy with heart problems in the baby. The advantages of their use during pregnancy may thus not outweigh the possible negative effects on the baby. === Withdrawal === Escitalopram discontinuation, particularly abruptly, may cause certain withdrawal symptoms such as ""electric shock"" sensations, colloquially called ""brain shivers"" or ""brain zaps"" by those affected. Frequent symptoms in one study were dizziness (44%), muscle tension (44%), chills (44%), confusion or trouble concentrating (40%), amnesia (28%), and crying (28%). Very slow tapering is recommended. There have been spontaneous reports of discontinuation of escitalopram and other SSRIs and SNRIs, especially when abrupt, leading to dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, anxiety, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. Other symptoms such as panic attacks, hostility, aggression, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), mania, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation can emerge when the dose is adjusted down. == Overdose == Excessive doses of escitalopram usually cause relatively minor untoward effects, such as agitation and tachycardia. However, dyskinesia, hypertonia, and clonus may occur in some cases. Therapeutic blood levels of escitalopram are usually in the range of 20–80 μg/L but may reach 80–200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, and those who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods. Chiral techniques are available to distinguish escitalopram from its racemate, citalopram. == Interactions == Escitalopram weakly inhibits CYP2D6, and hence may increase plasma levels of some CYP2D6 substrates such as aripiprazole, risperidone, tramadol, codeine, etc. As escitalopram is only a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, analgesia from tramadol may not be affected. Escitalopram (at the maximum dose of 20 mg/day) has been found to increase peak levels of the CYP2D6 substrate desipramine by 40% and total exposure by 100%. Likewise, it has been found to increase peak levels of the CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol by 50% and overall exposure by 82%. Escitalopram does not inhibit CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2E1. Exposure to escitalopram is increased moderately, by about 50%, when it is taken with omeprazole, a CYP2C19 inhibitor. The authors of this study suggested that this increase is unlikely to be of clinical concern. Combination of citalopram with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine resulted in increased exposure to the escitalopram enantiomer, owing to the strong inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 by these agents. Bupropion, a known strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, has been found to significantly increase citalopram plasma concentration and systemic exposure (peak levels increased by 30%, total exposure increased by 40%); as of April 2018 the interaction with escitalopram had not been studied, but some monographs warned of the potential interaction. Citalopram did not affect the pharmacokinetics of bupropion or its metabolites in the study. Escitalopram should be taken with caution when using St. John's wort, ginseng, dextromethorphan (DXM), linezolid, tramadol, and other serotonergic drugs due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. As an SSRI, escitalopram should not be given concurrently with MAOIs. Escitalopram, similarly to other SSRIs, may increase bleeding risk with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid), antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements due to escitalopram's inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation via blocking serotonin transporters on platelets. Escitalopram can also prolong the QT interval, and hence it is not recommended in patients who are concurrently on other medications that also can prolong the QT interval. These drugs include antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, some antihistamines (astemizole, mizolastine), macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (except palonosetron), and some antiretrovirals (ritonavir, saquinavir, lopinavir). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Escitalopram increases intrasynaptic levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin by blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitter into the presynaptic neuron. Over time, this leads to a downregulation of pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which is associated with an improvement in passive stress tolerance, and delayed downstream increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which may contribute to a reduction in negative affective biases. Of the SSRIs currently available, escitalopram has the highest selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) compared to the norepinephrine transporter (NET), making the side-effect profile relatively mild in comparison to less-selective SSRIs. In addition to its antagonist action at the orthosteric site of SERT, escitalopram also binds to an allosteric site on the transporter, thereby decreasing its disassociation rate. Escitalopram binds to this allosteric site at a greater affinity than other SSRIs. The clinical relevance of this action is unknown. === Pharmacokinetics === Escitalopram is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and hence P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as verapamil and quinidine may improve its blood-brain barrier penetrability. In a preclinical study in rats combining escitalopram with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, its antidepressant-like effects were enhanced. == Chemistry == Escitalopram is the (S)-enantiomer (left-handed version) of the racemate citalopram, which is responsible for its name: escitalopram. == History == Escitalopram was developed in cooperation between Lundbeck and Forest Laboratories. Its development was initiated in 1997, and the resulting new drug application was submitted to the US FDA in March 2001. The short time (3.5 years) it took to develop escitalopram can be attributed to the previous experience of Lundbeck and Forest with citalopram, which has similar pharmacology. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Escitalopram is sold under many brand names worldwide such as Cipralex, Lexapro, Lexam, Mozarin, Aciprex, Depralin, Ecytara, Elicea, Gatosil, Nexpram, Nexito, Nescital, Szetalo, Stalopam, Pramatis, Betesda, Scippa and Rexipra. === Legal status === The FDA issued the approval of escitalopram for major depression in August 2002, and for generalized anxiety disorder in December 2003. In May 2006, the FDA approved a generic version of escitalopram by Teva. In July 2006, the U.S. District Court of Delaware decided in favor of Lundbeck regarding a patent infringement dispute and ruled the patent on escitalopram valid. In 2006, Forest Laboratories was granted an 828-day (2 years and 3 months) extension on its US patent for escitalopram. This pushed the patent expiration date from 7 December 2009, to 14 September 2011. Together with the 6-month pediatric exclusivity, the final expiration date was 14 March 2012. === Allegations of illegal marketing === In 2004, separate civil suits alleging illegal marketing of citalopram and escitalopram for use by children and teenagers by Forest were initiated by two whistleblowers: a physician named Joseph Piacentile and a Forest salesman named Christopher Gobble. In February 2009, the suits were joined. Eleven states and the District of Columbia filed notices of intent to intervene as plaintiffs in the action. The suits alleged that Forest illegally engaged in off-label promotion of Lexapro for use in children; hid the results of a study showing lack of effectiveness in children; paid kickbacks to physicians to induce them to prescribe Lexapro to children; and conducted so-called ""seeding studies"" that were, in reality, marketing efforts to promote the drug's use by doctors. Forest denied the allegations but ultimately agreed to settle with the plaintiffs for over $313 million. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == External links == Harris G (1 September 2009).

260	Ketoprofen	WIKIPEDIA	"Ketoprofen is one of the propionic acid class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic effects. It acts by inhibiting the body's production of prostaglandin. It was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in 1980. == Medical uses == Ketoprofen is generally prescribed for arthritis-related inflammatory pains or severe toothaches that result in the inflammation of the gums. Ketoprofen topical patches are being used for treatment of musculoskeletal pain. Ketoprofen can also be used for treatment of some pain, especially nerve pain such as sciatica, postherpetic neuralgia and referred pain for radiculopathy, in the form of a cream, ointment, liquid, spray, or gel, which may also contain ketamine and lidocaine, along with other agents which may be useful, such as cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, acyclovir, gabapentin, orphenadrine and other drugs used as NSAIDs or adjuvant, atypical or potentiators for pain treatment. Trials are going on for using this drug along with ibuprofen for management of lymphedema. Animal trial and some human trials have shown significant improvement over placebo control. Dr Stanley G Rockson, of Stanford University is leading these researches. === Efficacy === A 2013 systematic review indicated ""The efficacy of orally administered ketoprofen in relieving moderate-severe pain and improving functional status and general condition was significantly better than that of ibuprofen and/or diclofenac."" A 2017 Cochrane systematic review investigating ketoprofen as a single-dose by mouth in acute, moderate-to-severe postoperative pain concluded that its efficacy is equivalent to drugs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac. There is evidence supporting topical ketoprofen for osteoarthritis but not other chronic musculoskeletal pain. == Adverse effects == In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in fetuses that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. == Mechanism == Ketoprofen undergoes metabolism in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid (glucuronidation) by UGT enzymes, hydroxylation of the benzoyl ring by the CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes, and reduction of its ketone moiety (a carbonyl functional group, i.e. with carbon-oxygen double bond) by carbonyl reducing enzymes (CREs). Ketoprofen is used for its antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes reversibly, which decreases production of proinflammatory prostaglandin precursors. The patches have been shown to provide rapid and sustained delivery to underlying tissues without significantly increasing levels of drug concentration in the blood when compared to the traditional oral administration. === Chirality and biological activity === Ketoprofen has one stereogenic center in the side chain and hence exists as mirror-image twins. Majority of the profens are marketed as racemic mixtures. For most of the NSAIDs the pharmacological activity resides in the (S)-enantiomers with their (R)-enantiomer virtually inactive. An interesting observation about most profens including ketoprofen is that they undergo unidirectional metabolic inversion, chiral inversion, of the (R)- acid to its (S)-mirror-image version with no other change in the molecule. There have been concerns raised that Ketoprofen can break down into the parent benzophenone molecule in skin exposed to strong summer or tropical UV light and this could pose a theoretical cancer risk. Given such a risk it is better to use other pain killers in such circumstances. == History == The earliest report of therapeutic use in humans is in 1972. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names in Australia include Orudis and Oruvail. It is available in Japan in a transdermal patch Mohrus Tape, made by Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical. It is available in the UK as Ketoflam and Oruvail, in Ireland as Fastum Gel, in Estonia as Keto, Ketonal, and Fastum Gel, in Finland as Ketorin, Keto, Ketomex, and Orudis; in France as Profénid, Bi-Profénid, Toprec, and Ketum; in Italy as Ketodol, Fastum Gel, Lasonil, Orudis and Oki; in Greece as Okitask; in Poland as Ketonal, Ketonal active, Ketolek, in Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia as Knavon and Ketonal; in Romania as Ketonal and Fastum Gel; in Mexico as Arthril; in Norway as Zon and Orudis; in Russia as ОКИ (OKI), Fastum Gel and Ketonal; in Spain as Actron and Fastum Gel; in Albania as Oki and Fastum Gel; in Indonesia as Kaltrofen; and in Venezuela as Ketoprofeno as an injectable solution of 100 mg and 150 mg capsules. In some countries, the optically pure (S)-enantiomer (dexketoprofen) is available; its trometamol salt is said to be particularly rapidly reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, having a rapid onset of effects. == Veterinary medicine == Ketoprofen is a common NSAID, antipyretic, and analgesic used in horses and other equines. It is most commonly used for musculoskeletal pain, joint problems, and soft tissue injury, as well as laminitis. It is also used to control fevers and prevent endotoxemia. It is also used as a mild painkiller in smaller animals, generally following surgical procedures. In horses, it is given at a dose of 2.2 mg/kg/day. Studies have shown that it does not inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene B4, as originally claimed. It is therefore not considered superior to phenylbutazone as previously believed, although clinical signs of lameness are reduced with its use. In fact, phenylbutazone was shown superior to ketoprofen in cases of experimentally-induced synovitis when both drugs were used at labeled dosages. === Ecological problems === Experiments have found ketoprofen, like diclofenac, is a veterinary drug causing lethal effects in red-headed vultures. Vultures feeding on the carcasses of recently treated livestock develop acute kidney failure within days of exposure. == References == == External links =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}

267	7-diethylamino-4-methylcoumarin	PUBMED	" Organic liquid scintillation detectors are widely used to measure the presence of radiation. With these devices, there are advantages in that they are easy to manufacture, large in size, and have a short fluorescence decay time. However, they are not suitable for gamma spectroscopy because they are composed of a low-atomic-number material. In this regard, alternative materials for the secondary solute used in basic organic liquid scintillators have been investigated, and the applicability of alternative materials, the detection characteristics, and neutron/gamma identification tests were all assessed. 7-Diethylamino-4-methylcoumarin (DMC), selected as an alternative material, is a benzopyrone derivative in the form of colorless crystals with high fluorescence, a high quantum yield in the visible region, and excellent light stability. In addition, it has a large Stokes shift, and solubility in a solvent is good. Through an analysis in this study, it was found that the absorption wavelength range of DMC coincides with the emission wavelength range of PPO, which is the primary solute used with DMC. Finally, it was confirmed that the optimal concentration of DMC was 0.08 wt%. As a result of performing gamma and neutron measurement tests using a DMC-based liquid scintillator, it was found to perform well (FOM = 1.42) compared to a commercial liquid scintillator, BC-501A. Fluorescence anisotropy decays of the 7-diethylamino-4-methylcoumarin C1 in various polar solvents of different viscosities and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor character have been recorded by means of the fluorescence upconversion and time-correlated single photon counting techniques. The resulting characteristic times for the rotational diffusion fall into two classes with regards to the viscosity-dependency: n-alcohols and ""other"" solvents. This deviation from the simple Stokes-Einstein-Debye model may be interpreted in terms of rotation of the coumarin molecule under two different hydrodynamic boundary-conditions (""stick"" or ""slip"") in the two solvent classes. Possible explanations for this behaviour are discussed, and in particular solvent attachment and additional dielectric friction. Both these phenomena may in fact, under certain conditions, explain our findings. Our opinion, however, is that the dielectric friction model offers a more realistic picture of the additional rotational friction experienced by C1 in n-alcohols."

272	Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate	WIKIPEDIA	"Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate, diisooctyl phthalate, DEHP; incorrectly — dioctyl phthalate, DIOP) is an organic compound with the formula C6H4(CO2C8H17)2. DEHP is the most common member of the class of phthalates, which are used as plasticizers. It is the diester of phthalic acid and the branched-chain 2-ethylhexanol. This colorless viscous liquid is soluble in oil, but not in water. == Production == Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate is produced commercially by the reaction of excess 2-ethylhexanol with phthalic anhydride in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid or para-toluenesulfonic acid. It was first produced in commercial quantities in Japan circa 1933 and in the United States in 1939. DEHP has two stereocenters, located at the carbon atoms carrying the ethyl groups. As a result, it has three distinct stereoisomers, consisting of an (R,R) form, an (S,S) form (diastereomers), and a meso (R, S) form. As most 2-ethylhexanol is produced as a racemic mixture, commercially-produced DEHP is therefore racemic as well, and consists of a 1:1:2 statistical mixture of stereoisomers. == Use == Due to its suitable properties and the low cost, DEHP is widely used as a plasticizer in manufacturing of articles made of PVC. Plastics may contain 1% to 40% of DEHP. It is also used as a hydraulic fluid and as a dielectric fluid in capacitors. DEHP also finds use as a solvent in glowsticks. Approximately three million tonnes are produced and used annually worldwide. Manufacturers of flexible PVC articles can choose among several alternative plasticizers offering similar technical properties as DEHP. These alternatives include other phthalates such as diisononyl phthalate (DINP), di-2-propyl heptyl phthalate (DPHP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and non-phthalates such as 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH), dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP), and citrate esters. == Environmental exposure == DEHP is a component of many household items, including tablecloths, floor tiles, shower curtains, garden hoses, rainwear, dolls, toys, shoes, medical tubing, furniture upholstery, and swimming pool liners. DEHP is an indoor air pollutant in homes and schools. Common exposures come from the use of DEHP as a fragrance carrier in cosmetics, personal care products, laundry detergents, colognes, scented candles, and air fresheners. The most common exposure to DEHP comes through food with an average consumption of 0.25 milligrams per day. It can also leach into a liquid that comes in contact with the plastic; it extracts faster into nonpolar solvents (e.g. oils and fats in foods packed in PVC). Fatty foods that are packaged in plastics that contain DEHP are more likely to have higher concentrations such as milk products, fish or seafood, and oils. The US FDA therefore permits use of DEHP-containing packaging only for foods that primarily contain water. DEHP can leach into drinking water from discharges from rubber and chemical factories; The US EPA limits for DEHP in drinking water is 6 ppb. It is also commonly found in bottled water, but unlike tap water, the EPA does not regulate levels in bottled water. DEHP levels in some European samples of milk, were found at 2000 times higher than the EPA Safe Drinking Water limits (12,000 ppb). Levels of DEHP in some European cheeses and creams were even higher, up to 200,000 ppb, in 1994. Additionally, workers in factories that utilize DEHP in production experience greater exposure. The U.S. agency OSHA's limit for occupational exposure is 5 mg/m3 of air. === Use in medical devices === DEHP is the most common phthalate plasticizer in medical devices such as intravenous tubing and bags, IV catheters, nasogastric tubes, dialysis bags and tubing, blood bags and transfusion tubing, and air tubes. DEHP makes these plastics softer and more flexible and was first introduced in the 1940s in blood bags. For this reason, concern has been expressed about leachates of DEHP transported into the patient, especially for those requiring extensive infusions or those who are at the highest risk of developmental abnormalities, e.g. newborns in intensive care nursery settings, hemophiliacs, kidney dialysis patients, neonates, premature babies, lactating, and pregnant women. According to the European Commission Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), exposure to DEHP may exceed the tolerable daily intake in some specific population groups, namely people exposed through medical procedures such as kidney dialysis. The American Academy of Pediatrics has advocated not to use medical devices that can leach DEHP into patients and, instead, to resort to DEHP-free alternatives. In July 2002, the U.S. FDA issued a Public Health Notification on DEHP, stating in part, ""We recommend considering such alternatives when these high-risk procedures are to be performed on male neonates, pregnant women who are carrying male fetuses, and peripubertal males"" noting that the alternatives were to look for non-DEHP exposure solutions; they mention a database of alternatives. The CBC documentary The Disappearing Male raised concerns about sexual development in male fetal development, miscarriage, and as a cause of dramatically lower sperm counts in men. A review article in 2010 in the Journal of Transfusion Medicine showed a consensus that the benefits of lifesaving treatments with these devices far outweigh the risks of DEHP leaching out of these devices. Although more research is needed to develop alternatives to DEHP that gives the same benefits of being soft and flexible, which are required for most medical procedures, if a procedure requires one of these devices and if patient is at high risk to suffer from DEHP then a DEHP alternative should be considered if medically safe. === Metabolism === DEHP hydrolyzes to mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and subsequently to phthalate salts. The released alcohol is susceptible to oxidation to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid. == Effects on living organisms == === Toxicity === The acute toxicity of DEHP is low in animal models: 30 g/kg in rats (oral) and 24 g/kg in rabbits (dermal). Concerns instead focus on its potential as an endocrine disruptor. === Endocrine disruption === DEHP, along with other phthalates, is believed to cause endocrine disruption in males, through its action as an androgen antagonist, and may have lasting effects on reproductive function, for both childhood and adult exposures. Prenatal phthalate exposure has been shown to be associated with lower levels of reproductive function in adolescent males. In another study, airborne concentrations of DEHP at a PVC pellet plant were significantly associated with a reduction in sperm motility and chromatin DNA integrity. Additionally, the authors noted the daily intake estimates for DEHP were comparable to the general population, indicating a ""high percentage of men are exposed to levels of DEHP that may affect sperm motility and chromatin DNA integrity"". The claims have received support by a study using dogs as a ""sentinel species to approximate human exposure to a selection of chemical mixtures present in the environment"". The authors analyzed the concentration of DEHP and other common chemicals such as PCBs in testes from dogs from five different world regions. The results showed that regional differences in concentration of the chemicals are reflected in dog testes and that pathologies such as tubule atrophy and germ cells were more prevalent in testes of dogs from regions with higher concentrations. === Development === Numerous studies of DEHP have shown changes in sexual function and development in mice and rats. DEHP exposure during pregnancy has been shown to disrupt placental growth and development in mice, resulting in higher rates of low birthweight, premature birth, and fetal loss. In a separate study, exposure of neonatal mice to DEHP through lactation caused hypertrophy of the adrenal glands and higher levels of anxiety during puberty. In another study, pubertal administration of higher-dose DEHP delayed puberty in rats, reduced testosterone production, and inhibited androgen-dependent development; low doses showed no effect. === Obesity === When DEHP is ingested intestinal lipases convert it to MEHP, which then is absorbed. MEHP is suspected to have an obesogenic effect. Rodent studies and human studies have shown DEHP to be a possible disruptor of thyroid function, which plays a key role in energy balance and metabolism. Exposure to DEHP has been associated with lower plasma thyroxine levels and decreased uptake of iodine in thyroid follicular cells. Previous studies have shown that slight changes in thyroxine levels can have dramatic effects on resting energy expenditure, similar to that of patients with hypothyroidism, which has been shown to cause increased weight gain in those study populations. === Cardiotoxicity === Even at relatively low doses of DEHP, cardiovascular reactivity was significantly affected in mice. A clinically relevant dose and duration of exposure to DEHP has been shown to have a significant impact on the behavior of cardiac cells in culture. This includes an uncoupling effect that leads to irregular rhythms in vitro. Untreated cells had fast conduction velocity, along with homogenous activation wave fronts and synchronized beating. Cells treated with DEHP exhibited fractured wave fronts with slow propagation speeds. This is observed in conjunction with a significant decrease in the amount of expression and instability of gap junctional connexin proteins, specifically connexin-43, in cardiomyocytes treated with DEHP. The decrease in expression and instability of connexin-43 may be due to the down regulation of tubulin and kinesin genes, and the alteration of microtubule structure, caused by DEHP; all of which are responsible for the transport of protein products. Also, DEHP caused down regulation of several growth factors, such as angiotensinogen, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor C and A, and endothelial-1. The DEHP-induced down regulation of these growth factors may also contribute to the reduced expression and instability of connexin-43. DEHP has also been shown, in vitro using cardiac muscle cells, to cause activation of PPAR-alpha gene, which is a key regulator in lipid metabolism and peroxisome proliferation; both of which can be involved in atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia, which are precursors of cardiovascular disease. Once metabolized into MEHP, the molecule has been shown to lengthen action potential duration and slow epicardial conduction velocity in Langendorff perfused rodent hearts. === Other health effects === Studies in mice have shown other adverse health effects due to DEHP exposure. Ingestion of 0.01% DEHP caused damage to the blood-testis barrier as well as induction of experimental autoimmune orchitis. There is also a correlation between DEHP plasma levels in women and endometriosis. DEHP is also a possible cancer causing agent in humans, although human studies remain inconclusive, due to the exposure of multiple elements and limited research. In vitro and rodent studies indicate that DEHP is involved in many molecular events, including increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, oxidative damage, and selective clonal expansion of the initiated cells; all of which take place in multiple sites of the human body. == Government and industry response == === Taiwan === In October 2009, Consumers' Foundation, Taiwan (CFCT) published test results that found 5 out of the sampled 12 shoes contained over 0.1% of phthalate plasticizer content, including DEHP, which exceeds the government's Toy Safety Standard (CNS 4797). CFCT recommend that users should first wear socks to avoid direct skin contact. In May 2011, the illegal use of the plasticizer DEHP in clouding agents for use in food and beverages has been reported in Taiwan. An inspection of products initially discovered the presence of plasticizers. As more products were tested, inspectors found more manufacturers using DEHP and DINP. The Department of Health confirmed that contaminated food and beverages had been exported to other countries and regions, which reveals the widespread prevalence of toxic plasticizers. === European Union === Concerns about chemicals ingested by children when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission to order a temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of which is based on an opinion by the Commission's Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other phthalates (DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of phthalates (DINP, DIDP, and DNOP) ""in toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth by children"". Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including musk xylene, MDA, HBCDD, DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in Annex XIV of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011. According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015. In 2012, Danish Environment Minister Ida Auken announced the ban of DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP, pushing Denmark ahead of the European Union which has already started a process of phasing out phthalates. However, it was postponed by two years and would take effect in 2015 and not in December 2013, which was the initial plan. The reason is that the four phthalates are far more common than expected and that producers cannot phase out phthalates as fast as the Ministry of Environment requested. In 2012, France became the first country in the EU to ban the use of DEHP in pediatrics, neonatal, and maternity wards in hospitals. DEHP has now been classified as a Category 1B reprotoxin, and is now on the Annex XIV of the European Union's REACH legislation. DEHP has been phased out in Europe under REACH and can only be used in specific cases if an authorization has been granted. Authorizations are granted by the European Commission, after obtaining the opinion of the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). === California === DEHP is classified as a ""chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm"" (in this case, both) under the terms of Proposition 65. == References == == Further reading == Maradonna, Francesca; Evangelisti, Matteo; Gioacchini, Giorgia; et al.

275	Murideoxycholic acid	PUBMED	 Murideoxycholic acid (MDCA), as a significant secondary bile acid derived from the metabolism of α/β-muricholic acid in rodents, is an important component in maintaining the bile acid homeostasis. However, the biosynthesis of MDCA remains a challenging task. Here, we present the development of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP102A1 (P450 BM3) from Bacillus megaterium, employing semi-rational protein engineering technique. Following three rounds of mutagenesis, a triple variant (T260G/G328A/L82V) has been discovered that proficiently catalyzes the 6β-hydroxylation of lithocholic acid (LCA), thereby generating MDCA with an impressive 8.5-fold increase in yield compared to the template P450 BM3 mutant. The MDCA selectivity has been also promoted from 62.0% to 96.3%. This biocatalyst introduces a novel approach for the biosynthesis of MDCA from LCA. Furthermore, molecular docking and dynamics simulations have been employed to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced LCA conversion and MDCA selectivity. The metabolism and time-courses of urinary and fecal excretions of murideoxycholic acid (MDCA; 3 alpha,6 beta-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid), a 6 beta-hydroxylated bile acid, was investigated in man. The study was carried out in two groups of subjects. Six cholecystectomized patients fitted with a cystic duct drain ingested 100 mg of a tracer dose of 3H-MDCA. Time-course of radioactivity in plasma was then followed for an 8-h period. Biliary, urinary and fecal excretions of radioactivity were measured for a 5-day period and excreted MDCA metabolites were identified. Five lithiasic patients with intact enterohepatic circulation ingested 500 mg of the same tracer dose of 3H-MDCA. Radioactivity in plasma was followed for a 49-h period and urinary and fecal excretions of radioactivity were measured daily for 7 days. In the first group, the excretion of the radioactivity by the three routes (bile+urine+feces) reached 97.8 +/- 1.5% of the ingested dose but dropped to 75 +/- 8.3% (urine+feces) in patients in the second group. In cholecystectomized patients, the estimation of intestinal MDCA absorption was dependent on cystic duct drain flow rate and gave values ranging from 20% to 87%. The biological half-life of MDCA in lithiasic patients averaged 3.4 +/- 0.7 days. Radioactivity appeared in the plasma in the first hour and reached a maximum 6 and 3 h after the beginning of the experiment in group I and II respectively. In the second group, another peak of radioactivity in plasma was observed just after breakfast.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The effect of two hydrophilic bile acids, murideoxycholic acid (3 alpha,6 beta-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid) and ursodeoxycholic acid, on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and hepatic pathology and gallstone composition was studied in the prairie dog. Cholesterol gallstones were induced by feeding a diet containing 1.2% cholesterol for 75 days. The animals were divided into six groups, and gallstone regression was studied as follows: groups 2 and 5, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol; groups 3 and 6, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol plus 0.15% ursodeoxycholic acid; groups 4 and 7, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol plus 0.15% murideoxycholic acid. Animals in groups 2 to 4 were killed after an additional 6 wk; animals in groups 5 to 7 were killed after an additional 12 wk. Gallstone dissolution did not occur in any group. The gallstones in groups 2, 3, 5 and 6 were typical cholesterol aggregates, as determined by polarized light microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The gallstones of the murideoxycholic acid group were large, solitary, dark stones that appeared radiopaque under 22 kVp x-ray examination. Scanning electron microscopy showed that in these stones the cholesterol crystals had been replaced by an amorphous material, both within the stone and on the stone surface. Chemical analysis indicated that at the end of 12 wk the calcium/sodium salt of the taurine conjugate of murideoxycholic acid (murideoxycholyl taurine) comprised 70% of the stones; protein, cholesterol and small amounts of other bile salts were also present. In vitro studies confirmed the insolubility of the sodium and calcium salts of murideoxycholyl taurine. These studies indicate that the hydrophilic bile acids, murideoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, did not achieve gallstone dissolution under the conditions used. In the animals fed murideoxycholic acid, an insoluble calcium salt of murideoxycholyl taurine replaced cholesterol as the major constituent of gallbladder stones. This is the first example of an insoluble dihydroxy taurine-conjugated bile acid; administration of the unconjugated bile acid induced precipitation of a kind of gallstone not previously reported. The final result was transformation of cholesterol stones to bile salt stones.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.780889}
277	Enniatin b	PUBMED	" Mycotoxin enniatin B (ENN B) is a secondary metabolism product by  Enniatin B (ENN B) and Beauvericin (BEA) are cyclohexadepsipeptides that can be isolated from  Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the ""emerging"" mycotoxins, which are produced by various Fusarium species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described in vitro, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins in vivo are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC50 = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC50 = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier in vitro were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell® filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1. Thus, both compounds can reach the brain parenchyma where neurotoxic effects cannot be ruled out."	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -0.0007990269, 'OD': 0.0}
285	Oleamide	WIKIPEDIA	"Oleamide is an organic compound with the formula CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7CONH2. It is the amide derived from the fatty acid oleic acid. It is a colorless waxy solid and occurs in nature. Sometimes labeled as a fatty acid primary amide (FAPA), it is biosynthesized from N-oleoylglycine. == Biochemical and medical aspects == In terms of natural occurrence, oleamide was first detected in human plasma. It was later shown to accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid during sleep deprivation and induces sleep in animals. It has been considered as a treatment for mood and sleep disorders, as well as cannabinoid-regulated depression. In terms of its sleep inducing effects, it is speculated that oleamide interacts with multiple neurotransmitter systems. Some in-vitro studies show that cis-oleamide is an agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB-1 with an affinity around 8 micromolar. However, given oleamide's relatively low affinity for CB-1 and uncertainty about the concentration and biological role of oleamide in-vivo, it has been argued that it is premature to classify oleamide as an endocannabinoid. At larger doses oleamide can lower the body temperature of mice by about 2 degrees, with the effect lasting about two hours. The mechanism for this remains unknown. Oleamide has been found to enhance PPARα-dependent increase in doublecortin, a marker of neurogenesis in the hippocampus Oleamide is rapidly metabolized by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the same enzyme that metabolizes anandamide. It has been postulated that some effects of oleamide are caused by increased concentrations of anandamide brought about through the inhibition of FAAH. It has been claimed that oleamide increases the activity of choline acetyltransferase, an enzyme that is critical in the production of acetylcholine. == Other occurrences == Oleamide has been found in Ziziphus jujuba, also known as Jujube fruit. Synthetic oleamide has a variety of industrial uses, including as a lubricant. Oleamide was found to be leaching out of polypropylene plastics in laboratory experiments, affecting experimental results. Since polypropylene is used in a wide number of food containers such as those for yogurt, the problem is being studied. Oleamide is ""one of the most frequent non-cannabinoid ingredients associated with Spice products."" Analysis of 44 products synthetic cannabinoid revealed oleamide in 7 of the products tested. == See also == Anandamide Fatty acid amide hydrolase Virodhamine == References =="	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE	{'END': -0.00014442271, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -0.4761379, ' FOOD': -1.179283, ' IND': -0.24086274, 'UST': -5.2001665e-06, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0, ' PERSON': -0.0647314, ' CARE': 0.0}
287	Enrofloxacin	WIKIPEDIA	Enrofloxacin, sold under the brand name Baytril, among others, is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used for the treatment of animals. It is a bactericidal agent. The bactericidal activity of enrofloxacin is concentration-dependent, with susceptible bacteria cell death occurring within 20–30 minutes of exposure. Enrofloxacin has demonstrated a significant post-antibiotic effect for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and is active in both stationary and growth phases of bacterial replication. Enrofloxacin is partially deethylated by CYP450 into the active metabolite ciprofloxacin, which is also a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. In September 2005, the FDA withdrew approval of enrofloxacin for use in water to treat flocks of poultry, as the practice was noted to promote the evolution of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of the bacterium Campylobacter, a human pathogen. Enrofloxacin is available as a fixed-dose combination medication with silver sulfadiazine for the treatment of canine otitis externa. It is available as a generic medication. == Activity and susceptibility data == Enrofloxacin is a synthetic antibacterial agent from the class of the fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivatives. It has antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It is effective against: Pseudomonas aeruginosa Klebsiella Escherichia coli Enterobacter Campylobacter Shigella Salmonella Aeromonas Haemophilus Proteus Yersinia Serratia Vibrio Brucella Chlamydia trachomatis Staphylococcus (including penicillinase-producing and methicillin-resistant strains) Mycoplasma Mycobacterium Variable activity against: Streptococcus Ineffective against: Anaerobes The following data represent minimum inhibitory concentration ranges for a few medically significant bacterial pathogens: Escherichia coli - 0.022 - 0.03 μg/mL Staphylococcus aureus - 0.0925 - 64 μg/mL Pseudomonas aeruginosa - 0.05 μg/mL == Adverse effects/warnings == Enrofloxacin was banned for poultry use in the United States in 2005. == Overdosage/acute toxicity == It is unlikely that an acute overdose of either compound would result in symptoms more serious than either anorexia or vomiting, but the adverse effects noted above could occur. Dogs receiving 10 times the labeled dosage rate of enrofloxacin for at least 14 days developed only vomiting and anorexia. Death did occur in some dogs when fed 25 times the labeled rate for 11 days, however. Oral LD50: greater than 5000 mg/kg Dermal LD50: greater than 2000 mg/kg Inhalation LD50: greater than 3547 mg/m3 (4-hour exposure) Eye effects: irritant; reversible in less than 7 days. In cats, enrofloxacin is retinotoxic and can produce sudden-onset blindness, often irreversible. == Degradation == The brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum striatum can degrade the fluoroquinolone enrofloxacin using hydroxyl radicals. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.3856493e-06, 'ICAL': 0.0}

302	Imazalil	WIKIPEDIA	"Enilconazole (synonyms imazalil, chloramizole) is a fungicide widely used in agriculture, particularly in the growing of citrus fruits. Trade names include Freshgard, Fungaflor, and Nuzone. Enilconazole is also used in veterinary medicine as a topical antimycotic. == History == In 1983, enilconazole was first introduced by Janssen Pharmaceutica and it has since consistently been registered as an antifungal postharvest agent. Shortly after its introduction, enilconazole was used for seed treatment in 1984 and later used in chicken hatcheries in 1990. Like any fungicide, it was used to protect crops from becoming diseased and unable to yield a profitable harvest. Today, it continues to be utilized as an agricultural aid for its contribution to maintaining crop integrity and production output. == Use on crops == Enilconazole is found on a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, but it is primarily used on tubers for storage. Common fungi that are attracted to tubers are Fusarium spp, Phoma spp, and Helminthosporium solani which depreciate the crop quality. In 1984, when enilconazole was initially used for seed treatment, barley was a main target to mitigate crop loss due to disease. In addition, the antifungal agent is commonly used on citrus fruits. In the EU its use as a fungicide is permitted within some limits and imported fruits may contain limited amounts. == Hazards == In 1999, based on studies in rodents, enilconazole was identified as ""likely to be carcinogenic in humans"" under The Environmental Protection Agency's Draft Guidelines for Carcinogenic Assessment. However, because pesticide residues are well below the concentrations associated with risk, the lifetime cancer risk estimate associated with citrus fruit contamination was valued as insignificant. The EPA has established an equivalent toxicity level for human exposure at 6.1 x 10−2 mg/kg/day. This level placed it in Category I, II, and IV for oral, dermal, and inhalation toxicity. Category I is classified as highly irritating to the eyes, but not to the skin. As for oral toxicity, when the fungicide is transferred via food into the body, it must be metabolized before it can do any damage. Under California's Proposition 65, enilconazole is listed as ""known to the State to cause cancer"". The EPA determined there is no substantial risk of enilconazole toxicity through food and water exposure. Enilconazole has a very minute degree of mobility, so its level of drinking water contamination is quite low. The estimated environmental concentration (EEC) found the levels to be 0.072 ppb for surface water, which is much less than the 500 ppb comparison level for drinking water. == References == == External links == Imazalil page at EnvironmentalChemistry.com Diagram showing metabolism of enilconazole Pesticide Residues in Food"	INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL	INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL	{'IND': -0.030665584, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0, ',': -0.0058364877, ' MED': -0.0035443592, 'ICAL': 0.0}
304	Octocrylene	WIKIPEDIA	"Octocrylene is an organic compound used as an ingredient in sunscreens and cosmetics. It is an ester formed by the Knoevenagel condensation of 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate with benzophenone. It is a viscous, oily liquid that is clear and colorless. The extended conjugation of the acrylate portion of the molecule absorbs UVB and short-wave UVA (ultraviolet) rays with wavelengths from 280 to 320 nm, protecting the skin from direct DNA damage. The ethylhexanol portion is a fatty alcohol, adding emollient and oil-like (water resistant) properties. == Safety == Octocrylene can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer, resulting in an increased production of free radicals under illumination. It may also pass through the skin, into the blood stream, eventually being metabolized and excreted in urine in form of its metabolites. Octocrylene can convert to benzophenone through a retro-aldol condensation. The reaction occurs slowly over time, yielding significant concentration of benzophenone in all commercial cosmetics tested formulated with octocrylene. In coral, octocrylene has been shown to accumulate in the form of fatty acid conjugates and trigger mitochondrial dysfunction. === Regulation === Palau has banned the sale and use of three reef-toxic UV filters including octocrylene in its Responsible Tourism Education Act of 2018. The United States Virgin Islands has also banned the use of sunscreens containing octocrylene, requiring that all visitors use ""non-nano mineral sunscreen"" containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. == References =="	PERSONAL CARE	PERSONAL CARE	{'PERSON': -2.9279307e-05, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}
305	Oleuropein	WIKIPEDIA	Oleuropein is a glycosylated seco-iridoid, a type of phenolic bitter compound found in green olive skin, flesh, seeds, and leaves. The term oleuropein is derived from the botanical name of the olive tree, Olea europaea. Because of its bitter taste, oleuropein must be completely removed or decomposed to make olives edible. During processing of bitter and inedible green olives for consumption as table olives, oleuropein is removed from olives via a number of methods, including by immersion in lye. == Chemical treatment == Oleuropein is a derivative of elenolic acid linked to the orthodiphenol hydroxytyrosol by an ester bond and to a molecule of glucose by a glycosidic bond. When olives are immersed in a lye solution, the alkaline conditions lead to hydrolysis of the ester bond. The basic conditions also significantly increases the solubility of these derivatives, facilitating their release into the lye solution. The high pH accelerates the oxidation of the phenolics, leading to blackness, as during their normal ripening, if the solution is oxygenated by air injection (alkaline oxidation of olives is also called the California process). The lye solution is replaced several times until the bitter taste has dissipated. An alternative process uses amberlite macroporous resins to trap the oleuropein directly from the solution, reducing waste water while capturing the extracted molecules. Enzymatic hydrolysis during the maturation of olives is also an important process for the decomposition of oleuropein and elimination of its bitter taste. == Green olive blackening == Green olives may be treated industrially with ferrous gluconate (0.4 wt. %) to change their color to black. Gluconate, an edible oxidation product of glucose, is used as non-toxic reactant to maintain Fe2+ in solution. When in contact with polyphenols, the ferrous ions form a black complex, giving the final color of the treated olives. Black olives treated with iron(II) gluconate are also depleted in hydroxytyrosol, as iron salts are catalysts for its oxidation. == Research == Oleuropein has been proposed as a proteasome activator. == See also == Elenolic acid (a marker for maturation of olives) Hydroxytyrosol Ligstroside, a closely related compound also found in olives Oleocanthal Olive leaf Olive: Traditional fermentation and curing == References ==	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -6.511407e-06, 'OD': 0.0}
310	Tetracycline	WIKIPEDIA	"Tetracycline, sold under various brand names, is an antibiotic in the tetracyclines family of medications, used to treat a number of infections, including acne, cholera, brucellosis, plague, malaria, and syphilis. It is available in oral and topical formulations. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and loss of appetite. Other side effects include poor tooth development if used by children less than eight years of age, kidney problems, and sunburning easily. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It works by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacteria. Tetracycline was patented in 1953 and was approved for prescription use in 1954. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tetracycline is available as a generic medication. Tetracycline was originally made from bacteria of the genus Streptomyces. == Medical uses == === Spectrum of activity === Tetracyclines have a broad spectrum of antibiotic action. Originally, they possessed some level of bacteriostatic activity against almost all medically relevant aerobic and anaerobic bacterial genera, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, with a few exceptions, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp., which display intrinsic resistance. However, acquired (as opposed to inherent) resistance has proliferated in many pathogenic organisms and greatly eroded the formerly vast versatility of this group of antibiotics. Resistance amongst Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, anaerobes, members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and several other previously sensitive organisms is now quite common. Tetracyclines remain especially useful in the management of infections by certain obligately intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Rickettsia. They are also of value in spirochaetal infections, such as syphilis, and Lyme disease. Certain rare or exotic infections, including anthrax, plague, and brucellosis, are also susceptible to tetracyclines. Tetracycline tablets were used in the plague outbreak in India in 1994. Tetracycline is first-line therapy for Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia), Lyme disease (B. burgdorferi), Q fever (Coxiella), psittacosis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and nasal carriage of meningococci. It is also one of a group of antibiotics which together may be used to treat peptic ulcers caused by bacterial infections. The mechanism of action for the antibacterial effect of tetracyclines relies on disrupting protein translation in bacteria, thereby damaging the ability of microbes to grow and repair; however, protein translation is also disrupted in eukaryotic mitochondria leading to effects that may confound experimental results. The following list presents MIC susceptibility data for some medically significant microorganisms: Escherichia coli: 1 μg/mL to >128 μg/mL Shigella spp.: 1 μg/mL to 128 μg/mL === Anti-eukaryote use === The tetracyclines also have activity against certain eukaryotic parasites, including those responsible for diseases such as dysentery caused by an amoeba, malaria (a plasmodium), and balantidiasis (a ciliate). === Use as a biomarker === Since tetracycline is absorbed into bone, it is used as a marker of bone growth for biopsies in humans. Tetracycline labeling is used to determine the amount of bone growth within a certain period of time, usually a period around 21 days. Tetracycline is incorporated into mineralizing bone and can be detected by its fluorescence. In ""double tetracycline labeling"", a second dose is given 11–14 days after the first dose, and the amount of bone formed during that interval can be calculated by measuring the distance between the two fluorescent labels. Tetracycline is also used as a biomarker in wildlife to detect consumption of medicine- or vaccine-containing baits. == Side effects == Use of tetracycline antibiotics can: Discolor permanent teeth (yellow-gray-brown), from prenatal period through childhood and adulthood. Children receiving long- or short-term therapy with a tetracycline or glycylcycline may develop permanent brown discoloration of the teeth. Be inactivated by calcium ions, so are not to be taken with milk, yogurt, and other dairy products Be inactivated by aluminium, iron, and zinc ions, not to be taken at the same time as indigestion remedies (some common antacids and over-the-counter heartburn medicines) Cause skin photosensitivity, so exposure to the sun or intense light is not recommended Cause drug-induced lupus, and hepatitis Cause microvesicular fatty liver Cause tinnitus Cause epigastric pain Interfere with methotrexate by displacing it from the various protein-binding sites Cause breathing complications, as well as anaphylactic shock, in some individuals Affect bone growth of the fetus, so should be avoided during pregnancy Fanconi syndrome may result from ingesting expired tetracyclines. Caution should be exercised in long-term use when breastfeeding. Short-term use is safe; bioavailability in milk is low to nil. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cases of Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and erythema multiforme associated with doxycycline use have been reported, but a causative role has not been established. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Tetracycline inhibits protein synthesis by blocking the attachment of charged tRNA at the P site peptide chain. Tetracycline blocks the A-site so that a hydrogen bond is not formed between the amino acids. Tetracycline binds to the 30S and 50S subunit of microbial ribosomes. Thus, it prevents the formation of a peptide chain. The action is usually not inhibitory and irreversible even with the withdrawal of the drug. Mammalian cells are not vulnerable to the effect of Tetracycline as these cells contain no 30S ribosomal subunits so do not accumulate the drug. This accounts for the relatively small off-site effect of tetracycline on human cells. === Mechanisms of resistance === Bacteria usually acquire resistance to tetracycline from horizontal transfer of a gene that either encodes an efflux pump or a ribosomal protection protein. Efflux pumps actively eject tetracycline from the cell, preventing the build up of an inhibitory concentration of tetracycline in the cytoplasm. Ribosomal protection proteins interact with the ribosome and dislodge tetracycline from the ribosome, allowing for translation to continue. == History == === Discovery === The tetracyclines, a large family of antibiotics, were discovered by Benjamin Minge Duggar in 1948 as natural products, and first prescribed in 1948. Benjamin Duggar, working under Yellapragada Subbarow at Lederle Laboratories, discovered the first tetracycline antibiotic, chlortetracycline (Aureomycin), in 1945. The structure of Aureomycin was elucidated in 1952 and published in 1954 by the Pfizer-Woodward group. After the discovery of the structure, researchers at Pfizer began chemically modifying aureomycin by treating it with hydrogen in the presence of a palladized carbon catalyst. This chemical reaction replaced a chlorine moiety with a hydrogen, creating a compound named tetracycline via hydrogenolysis. Tetracycline displayed higher potency, better solubility, and more favorable pharmacology than the other antibiotics in its class, leading to its FDA approval in 1954. The new compound was one of the first commercially successful semi-synthetic antibiotics that was used, and laid the foundation for the development of Sancycline, Minocycline, and later the Glycylcyclines. === Evidence in antiquity === Tetracycline has a high affinity for calcium and is incorporated into bones during the active mineralization of hydroxyapatite. When incorporated into bones, tetracycline can be identified using ultraviolet light. There is evidence that early inhabitants of Northeastern Africa consumed tetracycline antibiotics. Nubian mummies from between 350 and 550 A.D. were found to exhibit patterns of fluorescence identical with that of modern tetracycline labelled bone. It is conjectured that the beer brewed by the Nubians was the source of the tetracycline found in these bones. == Society and culture == === Economics === According to data from EvaluatePharma and published in the Boston Globe, in the USA the price of tetracycline rose from $0.06 per 250-mg pill in 2013 to $4.06 a pill in 2015. The Globe described the ""big price hikes of some generic drugs"" as a ""relatively new phenomenon"" which has left most pharmacists ""grappling"" with large upswings"" in the ""costs of generics, with 'overnight' price changes sometimes exceeding 1,000%."" === Brand names === It is marketed under the brand names Sumycin, Tetracyn, and Panmycin, among others. Actisite is a thread-like fiber formulation used in dental applications. It is also used to produce several semisynthetic derivatives, which together are known as the tetracycline antibiotics. The term ""tetracycline"" is also used to denote the four-ring system of this compound; ""tetracyclines"" are related substances that contain the same four-ring system. === Media === Due to the drug's association with fighting infections, it serves as the main ""commodity"" in the science fiction series Aftermath, with the search for tetracycline becoming a major preoccupation in later episodes. Tetracycline is also represented in Bohemia Interactive's survival sandbox, DayZ. In the game, players may find the antibiotic to treat the common cold, influenza, cholera and infected wounds, but does not portray any side effects associated with tetracycline. == Research == === Genetic engineering === In genetic engineering, tetracycline is used in transcriptional activation. It has been used as an engineered ""control switch"" in chronic myelogenous leukemia models in mice. Engineers were able to develop a retrovirus that induced a particular type of leukemia in mice, and could then ""switch"" the cancer on and off through tetracycline administration. This could be used to grow the cancer in mice and then halt it at a particular stage to allow for further experimentation or study. A technique being developed for the control of the mosquito species Aedes aegypti (the infection vector for yellow fever, dengue fever, Zika fever, and several other diseases) uses a strain that is genetically modified to require tetracycline to develop beyond the larval stage. Modified males raised in a laboratory develop normally as they are supplied with this chemical and can be released into the wild. Their subsequent offspring inherit this trait, but find no tetracycline in their environments, so never develop into adults. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -1.9361265e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}
311	Azelastine	WIKIPEDIA	Azelastine, sold under the brand name Astelin among others, is a H1 receptor-blocking medication primarily used as a nasal spray to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and as eye drops for allergic conjunctivitis. Other uses may include asthma and skin rashes for which it is taken by mouth. Onset of effects is within minutes when used in the eyes and within an hour when used in the nose. Effects last for up to 12 hours. Common side effects include headache, sleepiness, change in taste, and sore throat. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a second-generation antihistamine and works by blocking the release of a number of inflammatory mediators including histamine. Azelastine was patented in 1971 and came into medical use in 1986. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 124th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Azelastine nasal spray is indicated for the local treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis, such as rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal pruritus in people five years of age and older. In some countries, it is also indicated for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis in adults and children ≥ 12 years old. Azelastine eye drops are indicated for the local treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis. == Side effects == Azelastine is safe and well tolerated in both adults and children with allergic rhinitis. Bitter taste, headache, nasal burning and somnolence are the most frequently reported adverse events. US prescribing recommendations warn against the concurrent use of alcohol and/or other central nervous system depressants, but to date there have been no studies to assess the effects of azelastine nasal spray on the CNS in humans. More recent studies have shown similar degrees of somnolence (approx. 2%) compared with placebo treatment. The most common side effect is a bitter taste (about 20% of people). Due to this, the manufacturer has produced another formulation of azelastine with sucralose. The problem of bitter taste may also be reduced by correct application of the nasal spray (i.e. slightly tipping the head forward and not inhaling the medication too deeply), or alternatively using the azelastine/sucralose formulation. In addition, anosmia (loss in the ability to smell) can occur with nasal spray antihistamines (including both formulations of azelastine). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Azelastine has a triple mode of action: Anti-histamine effect, Mast-cell stabilizing effect and Anti-inflammatory effect. === Pharmacokinetics === The systemic bioavailability of azelastine is approximately 40% when administered intranasally. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are observed within 2–3 hours. The elimination half life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance are 22 h, 14.5 L/kg and 0.5 L/h/kg respectively (based on intravenous and oral administration data). Approximately 75% of an oral dose is excreted in feces. Pharmacokinetics of orally administered azelastine is not affected by age, gender, or hepatic impairment. ==== Metabolism ==== Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family into its active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, and two inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. == Chemical properties == The chemical nomenclature of azelastine is (±)-1-(2H)-phthalazinone, 4-[(4-chlorophenyl) methyl]-2-(hexahydro-1-methyl-1H-azepin-4-yl)-monohydrochloride. It is white, almost odorless with a bitter taste. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}

313	Salinomycin	WIKIPEDIA	Salinomycin is an antibacterial and coccidiostat ionophore therapeutic drug. == Antibacterial activity == Salinomycin and its derivatives exhibit high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including the most problematic bacteria strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Salinomycin is inactive against fungi such as Candida and Gram-negative bacteria. == Cancer research == === Pre-clinical === Salinomycin has been shown by Piyush Gupta et al. of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Broad Institute to kill breast cancer stem cells in mice at least 100 times more effectively than the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel. The study screened 16,000 different chemical compounds and found that only a small subset, including salinomycin and etoposide, targeted cancer stem cells responsible for metastasis and relapse. The mechanism of action by which salinomycin kills cancer stem cells involves lysosomal iron sequestration, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species, lysosome membrane permeabilization and ferroptosis. Studies performed in 2011 showed that salinomycin could induce apoptosis of human cancer cells at higher concentrations. C20 amino derivatives such as ironomycin have shown to be more potent in vitro models of persister cancer cells and in vivo doi:10.1038/nchem.2778. Promising results from a few clinical pilot studies reveal that salinomycin is able to effectively eliminate cancer stem cells and to induce partial clinical regression of heavily pretreated and therapy-resistant cancers. The ability of salinomycin to kill both cancer stem cells and therapy-resistant cancer cells (persister) may define the compound as a novel and an effective anticancer drug. It has been also shown that salinomycin and its derivatives exhibit potent antiproliferative activity against the drug-resistant cancer cell lines. Salinomycin is the key compound in the pharmaceutical company Verastem's efforts to produce an anti-cancer-stem-cell drug. == Use in agriculture == Salinomycin is used in chicken feed as a coccidiostat. == Biosynthesis == A team from the University of Cambridge has cloned and sequenced the biosynthetic cluster responsible for salinomycin production, from Streptomyces albus DSM 41398. This has shown that the polyketide backbone of salinomycin is synthesised on an assembly line of nine polyketide synthase) multienzymes. Furthermore, the cluster contains genes involved in oxidative cyclization including salC (epoxidase) and salBI/BII/BIII (epoxide hydrolase) genes. The cluster also contains genes suspected to be involved in self-resistance, export, precursor supply and regulation. The cluster contains a NRPS-like carrier protein, SalX, that is suspected to tether “pre-salinomycin” during oxidative cyclization. By inactivating salC the researchers have demonstrated that salinomycin biosynthesis proceeds via a diene intermediate. == See also == Narasin a derivative of salinomycin which has an additional methyl group.

316	6,4'-dihydroxyflavone	PUBMED	 Paclitaxel is a widely used cancer chemotherapeutic agent for many solid tumors; but peripheral neuropathy is a major limitation for its clinical use. Studies have demonstrated the usefulness of flavone derivatives in chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. The present study evaluates the anti-neuropathic effect of 3', 4'-dihydroxyflavone on paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy and the underlying mechanisms. Paclitaxel was administered to mice in a single dose of 10 mg/kg, i.p.The neuropathic behavioural parameters such as mechanical allodynia, cold allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were assessed 24 h later. The test compound 3', 4'-dihydroxyflavone (50,100 or 200 mg/kg,s.c) was administered 30 min prior to the assessment of behavioral parameters. The possible mechanisms involving K Neuroinflammation is an immune response within the central nervous system against various proinflammatory stimuli. Abnormal activation of this response contributes to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington disease. Therefore, pharmacologic modulation of abnormal neuroinflammation is thought to be a promising approach to amelioration of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we evaluated the synthetic flavone derivative 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone, investigating its anti-neuroinflammatory activity in BV2 microglial cells and in a mouse model. In BV2 microglial cells, 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone successfully inhibited production of chemokines such as nitric oxide and prostaglandin E The effects of two antioxidants, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the flavonoid 3,4-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), on bovine embryo development in vitro were examined. Blastocyst development, total cell and inner cell mass (ICM) numbers, intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptotic indices and gene expression levels were examined before and after treatment of day 2 bovine embryos (≥2-4 cells) with various concentrations of 3,4-DHF or SOD for 6 days. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance, with significance defined at the P<0.05 level. SOD had no significant effect on bovine embryo development at any tested concentration (control, 32.8%; 300 U/ml, 33.9%; 600 U/ml, 24.2%). In contrast, 10 µM 3,4-DHF promoted higher blastocyst development (39.3%) than any other concentration (control, 26.7%; 1 µM, 30.3%; 50 µM, 29.5%; 100 µM, 20.5%). Compared with 300 U/ml SOD, 10 µM 3,4-DHF resulted in significantly higher blastocyst development (44.2%) (control, 31.5%; SOD 300 U/ml, 33.6%). Treatment with 3,4-DHF increased the ICM cell number and reduced intracellular ROS production and apoptotic cell numbers. When O(2) tension was decreased from 20% (high tension) to 5% (low tension), embryo development rates were doubled regardless of 3,4-DHF treatment. Under high O(2) tension, 10 µM 3,4-DHF treatment may render bovine embryo development similar to a low O(2) tension environment. The best blastocyst development was obtained under low O(2) tension plus 10 µM 3,4-DHF treatment. The relative expression levels of antioxidant (MnSOD), antiapoptotic (Survivin, Bax inhibitor) and growth-related genes (IFN-τ, Glut-5) were significantly increased after 3,4-DHF treatment, while the expression levels of oxidant (Sox) and apoptotic genes (Caspase-3 and Bax) were reduced. These results suggest that 3,4-DHF may promote the in vitro development of bovine embryos through its antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.23327394}
317	Aurantiamide	PUBMED	 Acute kidney injury (AKI) manifests as a clinical syndrome characterised by the rapid accumulation of metabolic wastes, such as blood creatinine and urea nitrogen, leading to a sudden decline in renal function. Currently, there is a lack of specific therapeutic drugs for AKI. Previously, we identified gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) as a pathogenic factor in AKI. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of a novel Chinese medicine monomer, aurantiamide (AA), which exhibits structural similarities to our previously reported GRPR antagonist, RH-1402. We compared the therapeutic efficacy of AA with RH-1402 both in vitro and in vivo using various AKI models. Our results demonstrated that, in vitro, AA attenuated injury, necroptosis, and inflammatory responses in human renal tubular epithelial cells subjected to repeated hypoxia/reoxygenation and lipopolysaccharide stimulation. In vivo, AA ameliorated renal tubular injury and inflammation in mouse models of ischemia/reperfusion and cecum ligation puncture-induced AKI, surpassing the efficacy of RH-1402. Furthermore, molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay confirmed GRPR as a direct target of AA, which was further validated in primary cells. Notably, in GRPR-silenced HK-2 cells and GRPR systemic knockout mice, AA failed to mitigate renal inflammation and injury, underscoring the importance of GRPR in AA's mechanism of action. In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that AA serve as a novel antagonist of GRPR and a promising clinical candidate for AKI treatment. This study was aimed at exploring the mechanism by which aurantiamide (Aur) targeted NLRP3 to suppress microglial cell polarization. The 7-month-old APP/PS1 mice and C57BL/6 mice were applied to be the study objects, and Aur was administered intragastrically to APP/PS1 mice at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg. The changes in the neurocognitive function of mice were measured by Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. In the in vitro experiments, the mouse BV2 cells were employed as the study objects, which were subject to treatment with 10 μM and 20 μM Aur and induced with LPS and IFN-γ in order to activate BV2 cells and induce their M1 polarization. Aur was found to suppress the M1 polarization of mouse microglia, reduce central neuroinflammation, and improve the cognitive function in mice. Meanwhile, Aur suppressed the activation and the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome. The results of experiments in vitro demonstrated that Aur inhibited the activation and M1 polarization of BV2 cells. Aur targets NLRP3 and suppresses the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Asperglaucide (ASP) is an aurantiamide, an effective constituent of purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), a safe to eat greenery. Effects of ASP on endothelial function, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, vascular fluidity, renal and vascular reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) production was examined in the two-kidney one-clip (2 K-1C) rat model of renovascular arterial hypertension. ASP toxicity, dose dependent eNOS gene expression and protein levels were also analyzed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The 2 K-1C model of hypertension was created via surgery and mean blood pressure (MBP) was measured by tail-cuff method during four weeks of ASP treatment. Erythrocyte deformability was monitored by rotational ektacytometry, while vascular constrictor and dilator responses were determined in organ baths. eNOS gene expression and protein levels were assessed in thoracic aorta and HUVEC. MBP was significantly decreased in hypertensive rats treated with ASP. Endothelium dependent vascular dilator and constrictor responses were also considerably improved following ASP treatment. There was a notable increase in red blood cell deformability in hypertensive rats treated with ASP as compared to hypertensive rats alone. A significant increase was observed in eNOS gene expression and protein levels in both normotensive and hypertensive rats treated with ASP. Treatment of HUVEC with 3 µM ASP notably increased eNOS mRNA and protein levels. In conclusion, ASP lowered blood pressure, improved endothelium-mediated relaxation, decreased renovascular ROS/RNS production in hypertensive rats. ASP also increased eNOS protein expression in aorta and HUVEC at nontoxic doses. ASP may have future potential as an anti-hypertensive agent.

319	Biochanin a	PUBMED	 Iron homeostasis plays a positive role in articular cartilage health. Excessive iron or iron overload can induce oxidative stress damage in chondrocytes and ferroptosis cell death, advancing knee osteoarthritis (KOA). However, up to date, few effective agents treat iron overload-induced KOA (IOKOA). Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) provides abundant resources for drug selection to manage bone metabolic conditions, including osteoporosis. Biochanin A (BCA) is a novel bioactive multifunctional natural compound isolated from Huangqi, which has protective effects on bone loss. Nevertheless, the function and mechanism of BCA in treating IOKOA are still elusive. This study seeks to uncover the potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms of BCA in the management of KOA with iron accumulation. Iron dextrin (500 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into mice to establish the iron overloaded mice model. OA was induced through surgery, and the progression was evaluated eight weeks following surgery. OA severity was evaluated with micro-CT and Safranin-O/Fast green staining in vivo. Iron deposition in the knee joint and synovium was assessed using Perl's Prussian blue staining. Ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) was then administered to primary chondrocytes to evaluate iron regulators mediated iron homeostasis. Toluidine blue staining was utilized to identify chondrocytes in vitro. The vitality of the cells was assessed using the CCK-8 test. The apoptosis rate of cells was measured using Annexin V-FITC/PI assay. The intracellular iron level was detected utilizing the calcein-AM test. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid-ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potentiality were reflected via fluorescence density. Utilizing RT-qPCR and western blotting, the expression level was determined. Micro-CT and histological staining of knee joints showed greater cartilage degradation and higher iron buildup detected in iron-overloaded mice. BCA can reduce iron deposition and the severity of KOA. Toluidine blue staining and the CCK-8 assay indicated that BCA could rescue chondrocytes killed by iron. Cell apoptosis rates were increased due to iron overload but improved by BCA. Further, the intracellular content of iron, ROS, and lipid-ROS was increased with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) treatment but restored after treatment with different concentrations of BCA. JC-1 staining revealed that BCA could reduce mitochondrial damage induced by iron overload. Iron overload was shown to promote chondrocyte ferroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, iron overload suppressed the expression of collagen II and induced MMP expression by catalyzing ROS generation with mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results showed that BCA could directly reduce intracellular iron concentration by inhibiting TfR1 and promoting FPN but also target the Nrf2/system xc-/GPX4 signaling pathway to scavenge free radicals and prevent lipid peroxidation. The results of this research indicate that BCA regulates iron homeostasis during the progression of osteoarthritis, which can open a new field of treatment for KOA. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive inflammatory disorder driven by a fibrotic cascade of events such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition, extracellular matrix production and collagen formation in the lungs in a sequential manner. IPF incidences were raising rapidly across the world. FDA approved pirfenidone and nintedanib (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) are being used as a first-line treatment drugs for IPF, however, neither the quality of life nor survival rates have been improved because of patient noncompliance due to multiple side effects. Thus, the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting TGF-β mediated cascade of fibrotic events is urgently needed to improve the survival of the patients suffering from devastating disease. The aim of this study was to investigate and validate the anti-fibrotic properties of Biochanin-A (isoflavone) against TGF-β mediated fibrosis in in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo models and to determine the molecular mechanisms that mediate these anti-fibrotic effects. The therapeutic activity of BCA was determined in in vitro/ex vivo models. Cells were pre-treated with BCA and incubated in presence or absence of recombinant-TGF-β to stimulate the fibrotic cascade of events. Pulmonary fibrosis was developed by intratracheal administration of bleomycin in rats. BCA treatment was given for 14 days from post bleomycin instillation and then various investigations (collagen content, fibrosis gene/protein expression and histopathological changes) were performed to assess the anti-fibrotic activity of BCA. In vitro/ex vivo (Primary normal, IPF cell line and primary IPF cells/ Precision cut mouse lung slices) experiments revealed that, BCA treatment significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the expression of TGF-β modulated fibrotic genes/protein expressions (including their functions) which are involved in the cascade of fibrotic events. BCA treatment significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the bleomycin-induced inflammatory cell-infiltration, inflammatory markers expression, collagen deposition and expression of fibrotic markers in lung tissues equivalent or better than pirfenidone treatment. In addition, BCA treatment significantly (p < 0.001) attenuated the TGF-β1/BLM-mediated increase of TGF-β/Smad2/3 phosphorylation and resulted in the reduction of pathological abnormalities in lung tissues determined by histopathology observations. Collectively, BCA treatment demonstrated the remarkable therapeutic effects on TGF-β/BLM mediated pulmonary fibrosis using IPF cells and rodent models. This current study may offer a novel treatment approach to halt and may be even rescue the devastating lung scarring of IPF. The heart undergoes pathological cardiac hypertrophy as an adaptive response to prolonged pathological stimulation, leading to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibroblast proliferation, and an increase in extracellular matrix. Chinese medicine monomers are now receiving much attention for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial remodeling. Biochanin A (BCA) is a kind of flavonoid structural monomer, which has a certain therapeutic effect on bone thinning disease, aging syndrome, lung cancer, etc. Moreover, it exhibits hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, anti-bacteria and other pharmacological properties. It is still unknown whether BCA has an impact on the mechanism of TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Here, cardiac remodeling was induced by TAC. BCA was injected intraperitoneally at 25 and 50 mg/kg/day one week in advance. Masson, WGA, DHE and other pathological staining and serum were used to detect the inhibitory effect of BCA on cardiac hypertrophy in mice. The anti-hypertrophic effect of BCA was demonstrated by studying the pathological manifestations of Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in vitro. The results showed that BCA significantly reduced TAC-induced fibrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and myocardial hypertrophy. BCA inhibited Ang II-induced cell hypertrophy and oxidative stress in NRCMs in vitro and Ang II-induced CF migration, proliferation, and collagen secretion. This suggests that BCA plays a key role in inhibiting the progression of myocardial remodeling, suggesting that BCA may be a promising agent for the treatment of myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis.

323	Quercetin 3-o-robinobioside	PUBMED	 Millettia aboensis (Hook. F.) Baker (Fabaceae) is popular in ethnomedicine for its acclaimed efficacy in a number of disease conditions. This study evaluated the immunomodulatory effect of the leaf extract as a possible mechanism of its ethnomedicinal uses. Humoral and cellular immune responses of Balb/c mice to tetanus toxoid and cyclophosphamide, respectively, were used to monitor immunomodulatory activities of the ethanol leaf extract and fractions of M. aboensis at 200, 300 and 400 mg/kg. Active (butanol) fraction of the extract was subjected to chromatographic purifications to isolate the active compound and the structure elucidated by a combination of 1D and 2D NMR and mass spectrometry. Stimulation of specific T-lymphocytes using intracellular cytokine staining technique was used to evaluate immune-enhancing activity of the isolated compound. The extract and fractions evoked increase in both humoral and cellular immunity. At 400 mg/kg of butanol fraction, the normalized mean secondary production of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were 9.0 and 7.7, respectively. Serum cytokine production by butanol fraction following secondary challenge with tetanus toxoid showed that IL-12, IL-17A and IFN-γ were expressed by 48.14, 41.37 and 38.22%, respectively. Structural elucidation of the active compound revealed presence of isomeric mixtures of quercetin-3-O-rutinoside and quercetin-3-O-robinobioside (Compound 1a/b). Compound 1a/b exhibited in vitro upregulation of specific CD4 M. aboensis expressed strong immune-enhancing properties, which may explain its ethnopharmacological use in disease management.

324	Monactin	PUBMED	 At a concentration of 10(-6)m, nigericin and monactin inhibited growth of Streptococcus faecalis, and the inhibition was reversed by addition of excess K(+). In the presence of certain antibiotics, the cells exhibited increased permeability to certain cations; internal Rb(+) was rapidly lost by exchange with external H(+), K(+) Rb(+), and, more slowly, with Na(+) and Li(+). No effect was observed on the penetration of other small molecules. Cation exchanges induced by nigericin and monactin were metabolically passive and apparently did not involve the energy-dependent K(+) pump. When the cells were washed, the cytoplasmic membrane recovered its original impermeability to cations. By use of monactin, we prepared cells whose K(+) content had been completely replaced by other cations, and the metabolic characteristics of K(+)-depleted cells were studied. Cells containing only Na(+) glycolyzed almost as well as did normal ones and, under proper conditions, could accumulate amino acids and orthophosphate. These cells also incorporated (14)C-uracil into ribonucleic acid but incorporation of (14)C-leucine into protein was strictly dependent upon the addition of K(+). When K(+) or Rb(+) was added to sodium-loaded cells undergoing glycolysis, these ions were accumulated by stoichiometric exchange for Na(+). From concurrent measurements of the rate of glycolysis, it was calculated that one mole-pair of cations was exchanged for each mole of adenosine triphosphate produced.

326	Tetrahydrozoline	WIKIPEDIA	Tetryzoline (INN), also known as tetrahydrozoline, is a drug used in some over-the-counter eye drops and nasal sprays. Tetryzoline was patented in 1954, and came into medical use in 1959. == Side effects == Tetryzoline eye drops may cause blurred vision, eye irritation and dilated pupils. Tetryzoline is not suitable for prolonged use as its vasoconstrictive effects within the eye eventually decrease or stop. If tolerance to the drug has developed, ceasing its use may cause a rebound effect and increase redness of the eyes — ⁠a vasodilatory effect. Intranasal use of tetryzoline may cause transient burning, stinging, or dryness of the mucosa and sneezing. Prolonged intranasal use often causes opposite effects in the form of rebound congestion with effects such as chronic redness, swelling and rhinitis. Prolonged use thus may result in overuse of the drug. In children, it might cause profound sedation. === Overdose === Overdose most often causes slow heart rate. Respiratory depression, low blood pressure, constricted pupils, hypothermia, brief episodes of high blood pressure, drowsiness, headaches and vomiting may also occur. In serious cases some of these effects may result in circulatory shock. Most often overdoses occur in children who have ingested the drug. There is no antidote for tetryzoline or other similar imidazoline analogue poisoning, but the symptoms can be alleviated. With treatment, death is rare. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tetryzoline is an alpha agonist for the alpha-1 receptor. This action relieves the redness of the eye caused by minor ocular irritants. Moreover, to treat allergic conjunctivitis, tetryzoline can be combined in a solution with antazoline. === Pharmacokinetics === In a healthy person, the biological half-life of tetryzoline is approximately 6 hours, and it is excreted in urine, chemically unchanged, at least in part. In one study, 10 people were given two drops of 0.5 mg/mL of tetryzoline eye drops (0.025–0.05 mg) at 0 hrs, 4 hrs, 8 hrs, and 12 hrs. Within a 24-hour time window, since the last dose of tetryzoline, the blood serum concentration of tetryzoline in the test subjects was 0.068-0.380 ng/mL and the urine concentration was 13–210 ng/mL. Both the blood and the urine levels of tetryzoline reached their maximums approximately 9 hrs after the last dose. These fluid-concentration levels correspond to normal ocular use of tetryzoline; thus, greater concentrations of tetryzoline in the blood and the urine of the user can indicate misuse of the drug or of poisoning with the drug. == Chemistry == Chemically, tetryzoline is a derivative of imidazoline. It has two enantiomers. == Society and culture == === Names === Tetryzoline is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN). === Urban legend === An urban legend suggests that tetryzoline can cause violent diarrhea if given orally, such as by putting a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting person's beverage. However, the actual results of the prank may be worse, varying from severe nausea and vomiting to seizures or a coma. Larger doses can cause death. Diarrhea is not a side effect. === Criminal use === In late August 2018, a South Carolina woman was charged with murdering her husband by putting eye drops containing tetryzoline in his drinking water. An autopsy found a high concentration of tetryzoline in his body. Tetryzoline has been used as a date rape drug in a number of cases due to its ability to cause dizziness and unconsciousness. In 2018, a 62 year-old woman in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, died in an apparent overdose or suicide involving tetryzoline and other substances; in November 2023 her caregiver was convicted of first-degree murder, following the allegation that her death was caused by a water bottle laced with Visine. In 2019, a North Carolina paramedic was accused of using tetryzoline eye drops to cause the death of his wife. The blood sample results showed about 30–40 times higher than the therapeutic level of tetryzoline. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
331	Erythromycin	WIKIPEDIA	"Erythromycin is an antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes respiratory tract infections, skin infections, chlamydia infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and syphilis. It may also be used during pregnancy to prevent Group B streptococcal infection in the newborn, and to improve delayed stomach emptying. It can be given intravenously and by mouth. An eye ointment is routinely recommended after delivery to prevent eye infections in the newborn. Common side effects include abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. More serious side effects may include Clostridioides difficile colitis, liver problems, prolonged QT, and allergic reactions. It is generally safe in those who are allergic to penicillin. Erythromycin also appears to be safe to use during pregnancy. While generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding, its use by the mother during the first two weeks of life may increase the risk of pyloric stenosis in the baby. This risk also applies if taken directly by the baby during this age. It is in the macrolide family of antibiotics and works by decreasing bacterial protein production. Erythromycin was first isolated in 1952 from the bacteria Saccharopolyspora erythraea. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 271st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Erythromycin can be used to treat bacteria responsible for causing infections of the skin and upper respiratory tract, including Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus and Corynebacterium genera. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae: 0.015 to 256 μg/ml Staphylococcus aureus: 0.023 to 1024 μg/ml Streptococcus pyogenes: 0.004 to 256 μg/ml Corynebacterium minutissimum: 0.015 to 64 μg/ml It may be useful in treating gastroparesis due to this promotility effect. It has been shown to improve feeding intolerances in those who are critically ill. Intravenous erythromycin may also be used in endoscopy to help clear stomach contents to enhance endoscopic visualization, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and subsequent management. === Available forms === Erythromycin is available in enteric-coated tablets, slow-release capsules, oral suspensions, ophthalmic solutions, ointments, gels, enteric-coated capsules, non enteric-coated tablets, non enteric-coated capsules, and injections. The following erythromycin combinations are available for oral dosage: erythromycin base (capsules, tablets) erythromycin estolate (capsules, oral suspension, tablets), contraindicated during pregnancy erythromycin ethylsuccinate (oral suspension, tablets) erythromycin stearate (oral suspension, tablets) For injection, the available combinations are: erythromycin gluceptate erythromycin lactobionate For ophthalmic use: erythromycin base (ointment) == Adverse effects == Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, are very common because erythromycin is a motilin agonist. More serious side effects include arrhythmia with prolonged QT intervals, including torsades de pointes, and reversible deafness. Allergic reactions range from urticaria to anaphylaxis. Cholestasis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome are some other rare side effects that may occur. Studies have shown evidence both for and against the association of pyloric stenosis and exposure to erythromycin prenatally and postnatally. Exposure to erythromycin (especially long courses at antimicrobial doses, and also through breastfeeding) has been linked to an increased probability of pyloric stenosis in young infants. Erythromycin used for feeding intolerance in young infants has not been associated with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Erythromycin estolate has been associated with reversible hepatotoxicity in pregnant women in the form of elevated serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and is not recommended during pregnancy. Some evidence suggests similar hepatotoxicity in other populations. It can also affect the central nervous system, causing psychotic reactions, nightmares, and night sweats. == Interactions == Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily. The activity of the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g., dexamethasone), which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, including erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor) — are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels and the potential for rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated. Earlier case reports on sudden death prompted a study on a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap). Interactions with theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, were also shown. Erythromycin and doxycycline can have a synergistic effect when combined and kill bacteria (E. coli) with a higher potency than the sum of the two drugs together. This synergistic relationship is only temporary. After approximately 72 hours, the relationship shifts to become antagonistic, whereby a 50/50 combination of the two drugs kills less bacteria than if the two drugs were administered separately. It may alter the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills because of its effect on the gut flora. A review found that when erythromycin was given with certain oral contraceptives, there was an increase in the maximum serum concentrations and AUC of estradiol and dienogest. Erythromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 system, which means it can have a rapid effect on levels of other drugs metabolised by this system, e.g., warfarin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Erythromycin displays bacteriostatic activity or inhibits growth of bacteria, especially at higher concentrations. By binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial rRNA complex, protein synthesis and subsequent structure and function processes critical for life or replication are inhibited. Erythromycin interferes with aminoacyl translocation, preventing the transfer of the tRNA bound at the A site of the rRNA complex to the P site of the rRNA complex. Without this translocation, the A site remains occupied, thus the addition of an incoming tRNA and its attached amino acid to the nascent polypeptide chain is inhibited. This interferes with the production of functionally useful proteins, which is the basis of this antimicrobial action. Erythromycin increases gut motility by binding to motilin receptor, thus it is a motilin receptor agonist in addition to its antimicrobial properties. It can be therefore administered intravenously as a stomach emptying stimulant. === Pharmacokinetics === Erythromycin is easily inactivated by gastric acid; therefore, all orally administered formulations are given as either enteric-coated or more-stable salts or esters, such as erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Erythromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, erythromycin is actively transported to the site of infection, where, during active phagocytosis, large concentrations of erythromycin are released. === Metabolism === Most of erythromycin is metabolised by demethylation in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4. Its main elimination route is in the bile with little renal excretion, 2%–15% unchanged drug. Erythromycin's elimination half-life ranges between 1.5 and 2.0 hours and is between 5 and 6 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease. Erythromycin levels peak in the serum 4 hours after dosing; ethylsuccinate peaks 0.5–2.5 hours after dosing, but can be delayed if digested with food. Erythromycin crosses the placenta and enters breast milk. The American Association of Pediatrics determined erythromycin is safe to take while breastfeeding. Absorption in pregnant patients has been shown to be variable, frequently resulting in levels lower than in nonpregnant patients. == Chemistry == === Composition === Standard-grade erythromycin is primarily composed of four related compounds known as erythromycins A, B, C, and D. Each of these compounds can be present in varying amounts and can differ by lot. Erythromycin A has been found to have the most antibacterial activity, followed by erythromycin B. Erythromycins C and D are about half as active as erythromycin A. Some of these related compounds have been purified and can be studied and researched individually. === Synthesis === Over the three decades after the discovery of erythromycin A and its activity as an antimicrobial, many attempts were made to synthesize it in the laboratory. The presence of 10 stereogenic carbons and several points of distinct substitution has made the total synthesis of erythromycin A a formidable task. Complete syntheses of erythromycins’ related structures and precursors such as 6-deoxyerythronolide B have been accomplished, giving way to possible syntheses of different erythromycins and other macrolide antimicrobials. Woodward successfully completed the synthesis of erythromycin A, which was published in 1981. == History == In 1949 Abelardo B. Aguilar, a Filipino scientist, sent some soil samples to his employer at Eli Lilly. Aguilar managed to isolate erythromycin from the metabolic products of a strain of Streptomyces erythreus (designation changed to Saccharopolyspora erythraea) found in the samples. Aguilar received no further credit or compensation for his discovery. The scientist was allegedly promised a trip to the company's manufacturing plant in Indianapolis, but it was never fulfilled. In a letter to the company's president, Aguilar wrote: “A leave of absence is all I ask as I do not wish to sever my connection with a great company which has given me wonderful breaks in life.” The request was not granted. Aguilar reached out to Eli Lilly again in 1993, requesting royalties from sales of the drug over the years, intending to use them to put up a foundation for poor and sickly Filipinos. This request was also denied. He died in September of the same year. Lilly filed for patent protection on the compound which was granted in 1953. The product was launched commercially in 1952 under the brand name Ilosone (after the Philippine region of Iloilo where it was originally collected). Erythromycin was formerly also called Ilotycin. The antibiotic clarithromycin was invented by scientists at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in the 1970s as a result of their efforts to overcome the acid instability of erythromycin. == Society and culture == === Economics === It is available as a generic medication. In the United States, in 2014, the price increased to seven dollars per 500mg tablet. The US price of erythromycin rose three times between 2010 and 2015, from 24 cents per 500mg tablet in 2010 to $8.96 in 2015. In 2017, a Kaiser Health News study found that the per-unit cost of dozens of generics doubled or even tripled from 2015 to 2016, increasing spending by the Medicaid program. Due to price increases by drug manufacturers, Medicaid paid on average $2,685,330 more for Erythromycin in 2016 compared to 2015 (not including rebates). In the US by 2018, generic drug prices had climbed another 5% on average. The UK price listed in the BNF for erythromycin 500mg tablets was £36.40 for 100 tablets (36.4 pence each) as of August 2024. This price is not paid by NHS patients: there is no NHS prescription charge in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland; while NHS patients in England without an exemption are liable for a flat rate prescription charge. As of May 2024, that charge was £9.90 for each prescribed medicine. === Brand names === Brand names include Robimycin, E-Mycin, E.E.S. Granules, E.E.S.-200, E.E.S.-400, E.E.S.-400 Filmtab, Erymax, Ery-Tab, Eryc, Ranbaxy, Erypar, EryPed, Eryped 200, Eryped 400, Erythrocin Stearate Filmtab, Erythrocot, E-Base, Erythroped, Ilosone, MY-E, Pediamycin, Zineryt, Abboticin, Abboticin-ES, Erycin, PCE Dispertab, Stiemycine, Acnasol, and Tiloryth. == Veterinary uses == Erythromycin is also used in fishcare for the ""broad spectrum treatment and control of bacterial disease"". Body slime, mouth fungus, furunculosis, bacterial gill illness, and hemorrhagic septicaemia are all examples of bacterial diseases in fish that may be treated and controlled with this therapy. The usage of Erythromycin in fishcare is mainly limited to therapies targeting gram-positive bacteria. == References =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -4.3202e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}

334	Hydrocortisone acetate	WIKIPEDIA	Hydrocortisone acetate is a synthetic glucocorticoid corticosteroid and a corticosteroid ester. The acetate group helps to protect the hydrocortisone molecule from being broken down by enzymes in the body (prolongs the duration of action of hydrocortisone) and allows it to be absorbed more easily. == Oral bioavailability == Hydrocortisone has a lower bioavailability than hydrocortisone acetate when taken orally, because hydrocortisone is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys before reaching its target tissue. On the other hand, hydrocortisone acetate is more stable and less susceptible to metabolism, allowing a higher proportion of the drug to be absorbed and reach systemic circulation. Therefore, hydrocortisone acetate is often preferred for oral administration over hydrocortisone. == References ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -3.1281633e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}

It is a synthetic analog of the adrenal corticosteroids. Although its exact mechanism of action is not known, it is effective when applied topically to cortico-responsive inflammatory dermatoses. It is available as a generic medication. == Adverse effects == Although the absorption of betamethasone dipropionate is small, when used for prolonged periods of time (periods exceeding two weeks), or across a large surface area (total use greater than 50 grams per week), it can have adverse effects. One such effect is the ability of the corticosteroid to suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. This can lead to a depression in the release of adrenal hormones such as cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH. Symptoms of HPA axis suppression are often subtle and variable, but can often be detected using simple blood or urine tests such at ACTH stimulation test or urinary free cortisol. Those at increased risk for HPA axis suppression are those who are more likely to absorb more of the steroid through the skin. These groups include: Those who have used topical corticosteroids over a prolonged period of time Those who have used corticosteroids to cover a large surface area Those with broken skin barrier or extensive abrasions Those who have recently undergone stress (such as illness, trauma, surgery) Children under the age of 12 HPA axis suppression is preventable by supplementation with glucocorticosteroids. If HPA axis suppression occurs, it is often reversed shortly after discontinuation of treatment. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === === Pharmacokinetics === Absorption of topical corticosteroids depends on several factors such as the vehicle, or delivery system used by the drug, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and whether or not an occlusive bandage is used in combination with the drug. The absorption of topical betamethasone dipropionate is theoretically minuscule; however, if absorbed it follows the same pharmacokinetic profile as is typical of systemic corticosteroids. It is metabolized primarily by the liver by hydrolysis to its metabolites B17P (primary) and betamethasone and the 6β-hydroxy derivatives of those metabolites, and it is excreted primarily by the kidneys. == Chemistry == Betamethasone dipropionate is a white to almost white crystalline powder. == Regulation == Betamethasone dipropionate was patented by Merck in 1987, as an augmented cream/lotion, Diprolene in the U.S., and Disprosone in Europe. These patents expired in 2003 and 2007 respectively leading to generic production of betamethasone dipropionate. During this time other topical corticosteroids such as triamcinolone acetonide and clobetasol propionate also became available as generic creams. Merck filed for ""pediatric exclusivity"" in 2001 launching a clinical trial to prove betamethasone dipropionate's safety and efficacy for use in pediatrics. Betamethasone has also been used in the formulation of combination products such as Luxiq, Lotrisone and Taclonex. Prestium Pharma: Luxiq (betamethasone valerate) Foam, 0.12% is a mid-strength corticosteroid foam used primarily to treat psoriasis or other inflammatory conditions of the scalp. Merck: Lotrisone (containing betamethasone dipropionate, clotrimazole) contains both a corticosteroid (betamethasone) and anti-fungal agent (clotrimazole) and is used to treat fungal infections that are also inflamed Leo Pharma: Taclonex (containing betamethasone dipropionate, calcipotriol) is a combination of corticosteroid (betamethasone) and a vitamin D analogue (calcipotriene) and is used to treat frequent and persistent dermatatoses by reducing inflammation and promoting healing of the skin barrier. == Names == Brand names include Alphatrex, Beta-Val, Diprolene, Diprolene AF, Diprosalic (with salicylic acid) Diprosone, Dovobet (LEO Pharma A/S), Eleuphrat and Luxiq. == References == == External links == ""Betamethasone dipropionate"".

337	7-dehydrocholesterol	WIKIPEDIA	7-Dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) is a zoosterol that functions in the serum as a cholesterol precursor, and is photochemically converted to vitamin D3 in the skin, therefore functioning as provitamin-D3. The presence of this compound in human skin enables humans to manufacture vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Upon exposure to ultraviolet UV-B rays in the sun light, 7-DHC is converted into vitamin D3 via previtamin D3 as an intermediate isomer. It is also found in the milk of several mammalian species. Lanolin, a waxy substance that is naturally secreted by wool-bearing mammals, contains 7-DHC which is converted into vitamin D by sunlight and then ingested during grooming as a nutrient. In insects 7-dehydrocholesterol is a precursor for the hormone ecdysone, required for reaching adulthood. 7-DHC was discovered by Nobel-laureate organic chemist Adolf Windaus. == Biosynthesis == It is synthesized from lathosterol by the enzyme lathosterol oxidase (lathosterol 5-desaturase). This is the next-to-last step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Defective synthesis results in the human inherited disorder lathosterolosis resembling Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome. Mice where this gene has been deleted lose the ability to increase vitamin D3 in the blood following UV exposure of the skin. == Location == The skin consists of two primary layers: an inner layer, the dermis, comprising largely connective tissue, and an outer, thinner epidermis. The thickness of the epidermis ranges from 0.08 mm to greater than 0.6 mm (from 0.003 to 0.024 inches). The epidermis comprises five strata; from outer to inner, they are the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. The highest concentrations of 7-dehydrocholesterol are found in the epidermal layer of skin—specifically in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum. The production of pre-vitamin D3 is, therefore, greatest in these two layers. == Radiation == Synthesis of pre-vitamin D3 in the skin involves UVB radiation, which effectively penetrates only the epidermal layers of skin. 7-Dehydrocholesterol absorbs UV light most effectively at wavelengths between 295 and 300 nm and, thus, the production of vitamin D3 will occur primarily at those wavelengths. The two most important factors that govern the generation of pre-vitamin D3 are the quantity (intensity) and quality (appropriate wavelength) of the UVB irradiation reaching the 7-dehydrocholesterol deep in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be used to produce the radiation. Another important consideration is the quantity of 7-dehydrocholesterol present in the skin. Under normal circumstances, ample quantities of 7-dehydrocholesterol (about 25–50 μg/cm2 of skin) are available in the stratum spinosum and stratum basale of human skin to meet the body's vitamin D requirements. 7-DHC insufficiency has been proposed as an alternate cause for Vitamin D deficiency. == Sources == 7-DHC can be produced by animals and plants via different pathways. It is not produced by fungi in significant amounts. It is made by some algae, but the pathway is poorly understood. Industrially, 7-DHC generally comes from lanolin, and is used to produce vitamin D3 by UV exposure. Lichen (Cladonia rangiferina) is used to produce vegan D3. 7-DHC is used for vitamin D3 synthesis via lanosterol in land animals, via cycloartenol in plants, and in algae together with another provitamin D ergosterol for D2. In fungi solely ergosterol is used for synthesis of D2 via lanosterol. == Interactive pathway map == == See also == Vitamin D Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase == References ==	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS, FOOD	{'END': -3.1281633e-07, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0, ',': -0.0013504724, ' FOOD': -0.0013357169}
338	Theobromine	WIKIPEDIA	"Theobromine, also known as xantheose, is the principal alkaloid of Theobroma cacao (cacao plant). Theobromine is slightly water-soluble (330 mg/L) with a bitter taste. In industry, theobromine is used as an additive and precursor to some cosmetics. It is found in chocolate, as well as in a number of other foods, including tea (Camellia sinensis), some American hollies (yaupon and guayusa) and the kola nut. It is a white or colourless solid, but commercial samples can appear yellowish. == Structure == Theobromine is a flat molecule, a derivative of purine and an isomer of theophylline. It is also classified as a dimethyl xanthine. Related compounds include theophylline, caffeine, paraxanthine, and 7-methylxanthine, each of which differ in the number or placement of the methyl groups. == History == Theobromine was first discovered in 1841 in cacao beans by the chemist A. Woskresensky. Synthesis of theobromine from xanthine was first reported in 1882 by Hermann Emil Fischer. == Etymology == Theobromine is derived from Theobroma, the name of the genus of the cacao tree, with the suffix -ine given to alkaloids and other basic nitrogen-containing compounds. That name in turn is made up of the Greek roots theo (""god"") and broma (""food""), meaning ""food of the gods"". Despite its name, the compound contains no bromine, which is based on Greek bromos (""stench""). == Sources == Theobromine is the primary alkaloid found in cocoa and chocolate. Cocoa butter only contains trace amounts of theobromine. There are usually higher concentrations in dark than in milk chocolate. There are approximately 60 milligrams (1 grain) of theobromine in 28 grams (1 oz) of milk chocolate, while the same amount of dark chocolate contains about 200 milligrams (3 grains). Cocoa beans naturally contain approximately 1% theobromine. Plant species and components with substantial amounts of theobromine are: Theobroma cacao – seed and seed coat Theobroma bicolor – seed coat Ilex paraguariensis – leaf Ilex guayusa – leaf Ilex vomitoria – leaf Camellia sinensis – leaf Theobromine can also be found in trace amounts in the kola nut, the guarana berry, yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis), and the tea plant. The mean theobromine concentrations in cocoa and carob products are: === Biosynthesis === Theobromine is a purine alkaloid derived from xanthosine, a nucleoside. Cleavage of the ribose and N-methylation yields 7-methylxanthosine. 7-Methylxanthosine in turn is the precursor to theobromine, which in turn is the precursor to caffeine. == Pharmacology == Even without dietary intake, theobromine may occur in the body as it is a product of the human metabolism of caffeine, which is metabolised in the liver into 12% theobromine, 4% theophylline, and 84% paraxanthine. In the liver, theobromine is metabolized into xanthine and subsequently into methyluric acid. Important enzymes include CYP1A2 and CYP2E1. The elimination half life of theobromine is between 6 and 8 hours. Unlike caffeine, which is highly water-soluble, theobromine is only slightly water-soluble and is more fat soluble, and thus peaks more slowly in the blood. While caffeine peaks after only 30 minutes, theobromine requires 2–3 hours to peak. The primary mechanism of action for theobromine inside the body is inhibition of adenosine receptors. Its effect as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor is thought to be small. == Effects == === Humans === Theobromine is a heart stimulator and diuretic but has no significant stimulant effect on the human central nervous system. It is a bronchodilator and causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. It is not currently used as a prescription drug. The amount of theobromine found in chocolate is small enough that chocolate can, in general, be safely consumed by humans. Compared with caffeine, theobromine is weaker in both its inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and its antagonism of adenosine receptors. The potential phosphodiesterase inhibitory effect of theobromine is seen only at amounts much higher than what people normally would consume in a typical diet including chocolate. ==== Toxicity ==== At doses of 0.8–1.5 g/day (50–100 g cocoa), sweating, trembling and severe headaches were noted, with limited mood effects found at 250 mg/day. Also, chocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because theobromine may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus. === Animals === Theobromine is the reason chocolate is poisonous to dogs. Dogs and other animals that metabolize theobromine (found in chocolate) more slowly can succumb to theobromine poisoning from as little as 50 g (1.8 oz) of milk chocolate for a smaller dog and 400 g (14 oz), or around nine 44-gram (1.55 oz) small milk chocolate bars, for an average-sized dog. The concentration of theobromine in dark chocolates (about 10 g/kg (0.16 oz/lb)) is up to 10 times that of milk chocolate (1 to 5 g/kg (0.016 to 0.080 oz/lb)), meaning dark chocolate is far more toxic to dogs per unit weight or volume than milk chocolate. The median lethal dose of theobromine for dogs is 100–200 mg/kg (0.0016–0.0032 oz/lb); therefore, a 10 kg (22 lb) dog would need to consume a minimum of 200 g (7.1 oz) of the most theobromine-rich (5 g/kg (0.080 oz/lb)) dark chocolate, or a maximum of 1 kg (2.2 lb) (of theobromine-rich milk chocolate), to have a 50% chance of receiving a lethal dose. However, even 40 g (1.4 oz) of milk chocolate may induce vomiting and diarrhea. The same risk is reported for cats as well, although cats are less likely to ingest sweet food, as cats lack sweet taste receptors. Complications include digestive issues, dehydration, excitability, and a slow heart rate. Later stages of theobromine poisoning include epileptic-like seizures and death. If caught early on, theobromine poisoning is treatable. Although not common, the effects of theobromine poisoning can be fatal. == See also == History of chocolate Theodrenaline == References =="	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	{'FO': -5.1331983e-05, 'OD': 0.0, ',': -0.0025989611, ' PERSON': -0.0065076514, 'AL': -3.1281633e-07, ' CARE': 0.0}
344	Brinzolamide	WIKIPEDIA	Brinzolamide (trade name Azopt) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used to lower intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Brinzolamide was approved as a generic medication in the United States in November 2020. == Chemistry == Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (specifically, carbonic anhydrase II). Carbonic anhydrase is found primarily in erythrocytes (but also in other tissues including the eye). It exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active of which is carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II). == Indications == Use for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and raised intraocular pressure due to either excess aqueous humor production or inadequate drainage of the humor via the trabecular meshwork. == Pharmacodynamics == Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion and thus lowers the intraocular pressure in the anterior chamber, presumably by reducing the rate of formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport; this may alleviate the effects of open-angle glaucoma. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === The recommended frequency for topical application is two times per day. Following ocular instillation, the suspension is systemically absorbed to some degree; however the plasma concentrations are low and generally below the limits of detection (less than 10 ng/mL) due to extensive binding by tissues and erythrocytes. Oral administration is less-favored due to variable absorption from the stomach mucosa and an increased side-effect profile versus ophthalmic administration. === Distribution === The compound is fairly well protein-bound (60%), but adheres extensively to the carbonic anhydrase-containing erythrocytes. Due to the abundance of readily-bound erythrocytes and minimal known metabolism, Brinzolamide's whole blood half-life is very long (111 days). === Metabolism === While definitive sites of metabolism have not been firmly established, there are several metabolites worthy of note. N-Desethylbrinzolamide is an active metabolite of the parent compound, and thus exhibits carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity (largely carbonic anhydrase-I, when in the presence of Brinzolamide) and also accumulates in the erythrocytes. However, Brinzolamide's other known metabolites (N-Desmethoxypropylbrinzolamide and O-Desmethylbrinzolamide) either have no activity or their activity is currently unknown. === Excretion === Brinzolamide is excreted primarily unchanged (60%) in the urine, although the renal clearance rate has not been definitively determined. N-Desethylbrinzolamide is also found in the urine along with lower concentrations of the inactive metabolites, N-Desmethoxypropylbrinzolamide and O-Desmethylbrinzolamide; exact levels have not been definitively determined. == Cautions == === Side effects === Common, but mild: blurred vision; bitter, sour, or unusual taste; itching, pain, watering, or dryness of the eyes; feeling that something is in the eye; headache; runny nose Rare, but serious: fast or irregular heartbeat; fainting; skin rash, hives, or itching; severe eye irritation, redness, or swelling; swelling in the face, lips, or throat; wheezing or trouble breathing === Precautions === Hypersensitivity to other sulfonamides Acute angle-closure glaucoma Concomitant administration of oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease or liver disease == Combinations == === With timolol === The combination of brinzolamide with timolol is marketed under the trade name Azarga. This combination may be more effective than either medication alone. === With brimonidine === The combination of brinzolamide with brimonidine is marketed under the trade name Simbrinza. This combination may be more effective than either medication alone. == References == == Further reading ==	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': 0.0, 'ICAL': 0.0}
347	Mls000028566-01!minoxidil	PUBMED	 Topical minoxidil (5% foam, 5% solution, and 2% solution) is FDA-approved for androgenetic alopecia (AGA) in men and women. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common cause of hair loss, often challenging to treat. While oral finasteride (1 mg/d) is an FDA-approved treatment for male AGA, oral minoxidil and oral dutasteride are not approved yet. However, clinicians have been increasingly using these two drugs off-label for hair loss. Recently, Japan and South Korea have approved oral dutasteride (0.5 mg/d) for male AGA. A probable efficacy ranking, in decreasing order, is - dutasteride 0.5 mg/d, finasteride 5 mg/d, minoxidil 5 mg/d, finasteride 1 mg/d, followed by minoxidil 0.25 mg/d. Oral minoxidil predominantly causes hypertrichosis and cardiovascular system (CVS) symptoms/signs in a dose-dependent manner, whereas oral finasteride and dutasteride are associated with sexual dysfunction and neuropsychiatric side effects. The average plasma half-lives of minoxidil, finasteride, and dutasteride are ∼4 h, ∼4.5 h, and ∼5 weeks, respectively. Minoxidil acts through multiple pathways to promote hair growth. It has been shown as a vasodilator, an anti-inflammatory agent, a Wnt/β-catenin signaling inducer, and an antiandrogen. Finasteride inhibits 5α-reductase (5AR) type II isoenzyme, while dutasteride inhibits both type I and type II. Thus, dutasteride suppresses DHT levels more than finasteride in the serum and scalp. Minoxidil was first introduced as an antihypertensive medication and the discovery of its common adverse event, hypertrichosis, led to the development of a topical formulation for promoting hair growth. To date, topical minoxidil is the mainstay treatment for androgenetic alopecia and is used as an off-label treatment for other hair loss conditions. Despite its widespread application, the exact mechanism of action of minoxidil is still not fully understood. In this article, we aim to review and update current information on the pharmacology, mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, and adverse events of topical minoxidil.

348	Histidylproline	PUBMED	 Histidylproline a metabolite of Thyrotrophin Releasing Hormone specifically binds to both high and low affinity sites in fresh rat brain membranes. Characterisation of the high affinity site under optimal conditions demonstrated an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of approximately 9nM and maximum binding capacity of approximately 120 fmols/mg protein. Kinetic analysis of [3H]-His-Pro binding is limited by low binding density, instability of the high affinity site and rapid degradation of the radioligand. The thiol blocking reagent pHydroxymercuriphenylsulphonic acid (HMPS) inhibited [3H]-His-Pro degradation but also reduced binding of the peptide to membranes. The results are discussed with reference to the lack of specific binding sites in brain for the proposed neuropeptide and TRH metabolite cyclo(His-Pro). All four possible stereoisomers of cyclo(histidylproline) were individually synthesized, purified, and characterized. They were each tested for anorectic activity in rats with a free feeding paradigm over 24 h. Contrary to literature reports, none significantly reduced food intake at any time over the test period.

353	6-methylcoumarin	PUBMED	 We investigated the effects of four coumarin derivatives, namely, 6-methylcoumarin, 7-methylcoumarin, 4-hydroxy-6-methylcoumarin, and 4-hydroxy-7-methylcoumarin, which have similar structures on melanogenesis in a murine melanoma cell line from a C57BL/6J mouse called B16F10. Our results showed that only 6-methylcoumarin significantly increased the melanin synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the tyrosinase, TRP-1, TRP-2, and MITF protein levels were found to significantly increase in response to 6-methylcoumarin in a concentration-dependent manner. To elucidate the molecular mechanism whereby 6-methylcoumarin-induced melanogenesis influences the melanogenesis-related protein expression and melanogenesis-regulating protein activation, we further assessed the B16F10 cells. The inhibition of the ERK, Akt, and CREB phosphorylation, and conversely, the increased p38, JNK, and PKA phosphorylation activated the melanin synthesis via MITF upregulation, which ultimately led to increased melanin synthesis. Accordingly, 6-methylcoumarin increased the p38, JNK, and PKA phosphorylation in the B16F10 cells, whereas it decreased the phosphorylated ERK, Akt, and CREB expressions. In addition, the 6-methylcoumarin activated GSK3β and β-catenin phosphorylation and reduced the β-catenin protein level. These results suggest that 6-methylcoumarin stimulates melanogenesis through the GSK3β/β-catenin signal pathway, thereby affecting the pigmentation process. Finally, we tested the safety of 6-methylcoumarin for topical applications using a primary human skin irritation test on the normal skin of 31 healthy volunteers. We found that 6-methylcoumarin did not cause any adverse effects at concentrations of 125 and 250 μM. Our findings indicate that 6-methylcoumarin may be an effective pigmentation stimulator for use in cosmetics and the medical treatment of photoprotection and hypopigmentation disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hepatic microRNA-122 (miR-122) on Sortilin-mediated apolipoprotein B100 (apoB-100) secretion, and on aortic lipid deposition and atherosclerosis (AS) lesions and to clarify the antiatherosclerotic mechanism of 6-methylcoumarin (6-MC) via the modulation of miR-122. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-122 was putatively overexpressed in a liver-specific manner and was downregulated in steatotic livers. miR-122 was shown to suppress the expression of Sortilin by complementarily pairing to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Sortilin mRNA via bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter assays, impeding Sortilin-mediated apoB-100 secretion from HepG2 cells. Administration of 6-MC significantly upregulated hepatocellular miR-122 levels, reducing Sortilin expression and apoB-100 secretion in HepG2 cells. The miR-122 mimic vigorously enhanced 6-MC-depressed Sortilin expression, while miR-122 inhibitor repealed the inhibitory effect of 6-MC on Sortilin expression to some extent in HepG2 cells. After internal intervention with the miR-122 precursor, and 6-MC supplementation alone or in combination with the miR-122 sponge led to the reduction in blood triglyceride (TG) levels, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and apoB-100 and a reduction in aortic lipid deposition and AS lesions in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE 1. Information about the metabolism of compounds is essential in drug discovery and development, risk assessment of chemicals and further development of predictive methods. 2. In vitro and in silico methods were applied to evaluate the metabolic and inhibitory properties of 6-methylcoumarin, 7-methylcoumarin and 7-formylcoumarin with human CYP2A6, mouse CYP2A5 and pig CYP2A19. 3. 6-Methylcoumarin was oxidized to fluorescent 7-hydroxy-6-methylcoumarin by CYP2A6 (Km: 0.64-0.91 µM; Vmax: 0.81-0.89 min(-1)) and by CYP2A5 and CYP2A19. The reaction was almost completely inhibited at 10 µM 7-methylcoumarin in liver microsomes of human and mouse, but in pig only 40% inhibition was obtained with the anti-CYP2A5 antibody or with methoxsalen and pilocarpine. 7-Methylcoumarin was a mechanism-based inhibitor for CYP2A6, but not for the mouse and pig enzymes. 7-Formylcoumarin was a mechanism-based inhibitor for CYP2As of all species. 4. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations of 6-methylcoumarin and 7-methylcoumarin in the active sites of CYP2A6 and CYP2A5 demonstrated a favorable orientation of the 7-position of 6-methylcoumarin towards the heme moiety. Several orientations of 7-methylcoumarin were possible in CYP2A6 and CYP2A5. 5. These results indicate that the active site of CYP2A6 has unique interaction properties for ligands and differs in this respect from CYP2A5 and CYP2A19.

Flavonoids derived from natural products are known for their antioxidant effects and their ability to delay cellular senescence. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate cellular senescence using flavonoids from natural sources. However, the detailed mechanisms and regulatory targets of some flavonoids exhibiting antioxidant effects have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we screened a library of flavonoids for antioxidant properties. Isoschaftoside, a glycosidic flavonoid, significantly reduced ROS levels in senescent cells. It was found that mitochondrial function was restored, and dependence on glycolysis was reduced in senescent cells treated with isoschaftoside. Additionally, we identified that isoschaftoside suppresses ROS by reducing the expression of  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common metabolic liver disease globally, and the incidence of NAFLD has been increasing rapidly year by year. Currently, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for NAFLD. Therefore, studies are urgently needed to explore therapeutic drugs for NAFLD. In this study, we show that isoschaftoside (ISO) dramatically reduces lipid deposition in cells. Meanwhile, ISO treatment reverses the NAFLD and reduces hepatic steatosis in mice. Importantly, we reveal that ISO suppresses the expression of light-chain 3-II (LC3-II) and SQSTM1/p62 in palmitic acid (PA) induced autophagy inhibition in the cell model and the NAFLD mouse model, which suggests that ISO might reverse NAFLD through regulating autophagy flux. We propose that ISO might alleviate hepatic steatosis in NAFLD via regulating autophagy machinery. Consequently, our study suggests that ISO might be of potential clinical value in the field of NAFLD therapy. ISO might have the potential for future therapeutic application.

357	Nicotine 1-n-oxide	PUBMED	 The distrubutions of nicotine-14C (2'- or methyl-labeled), cotinine-14C, and nicotine-1'-N-oxide-14C were studied by whole-body autoradiography in mice and in perfused rabbit lung. The compounds were administered either iv, sc, ip, or by inhalation. Blank sections were also incubated with nicotine-14C and cotinine-14C in vitro. The distributions were compared in a black (C57BL/6J), brown (C57L/J), and albino (A/HeJ) strain and in CD-1 germ-free mice. After administration of nicotine-14C in vivo, radioactivity was localized in all strains in bronchi, nasal mucosa, salivary gland, Harder's gland, liver, kidney, stomach, spleen, pancreas, intestine, bone, gallbladder, and adrenal medulla. In the pigmented strains, it was also localized in melanin in the eye, brain, and hair. Radioactivity did not accumulate in the bronchi of late-term fetuses or the 1-day-old newborn but was present in the 2-day-old and older. Cotinine-14C and nicotine-1'-N-oxide-14C, after iv administration, did not localize in bronchi or nasal mucosa at short time intervals after injection. Frozen sections incubated in vitro did not accumulate either nicotine-14C or cotinine-14C in the bronchi; whereas the affinity for melanin was unchanged. Incubation of fresh, nonfrozen mouse lung and perfusion of rabbit lung in vitro with nicotine-14C produced the same localization of radioactivity in bronchi as that seen after in vivo administration. Preheating the frozen sections or lungs in a microwave oven before incubation did not change the localization of radioactivity in the bronchi or other tissues. The localization of radioactivity in bronchi may be due to metabolism, active transport, or binding of nicotine; this mechanism is destroyed by freezing the tissue. 1. The cis and trans 1'-N-oxide metabolites of (2'R)-(+)-nicotine have the absolute configuration (1'S; 2'R) and (1'R; 2'R), respectively, and not the reverse as previously published. 2. Reinterpretation of metabolic data in the light of this reassignment reveals that N-oxidation of nicotine leads preferentially to the (1'R)-N-oxide, with little dependence on the configuration of the 2'-centre. 3. It is proposed that (2'S)-(-)-nicotine and (2'R)-(+)-nicotine bind to the same enzymic site by two distinct modes of binding; each of these modes involves the more basic centre (in this case the pyrrolidine ring) as the governing binding moiety. Several microorganisms were examined for their abilities to convert S-nicotine into nornicotine. Five microorganisms including Microsporum gypseum (ATCC 11395) produced nornicotine and three unknown metabolites. M. gypseum efficiently reduced nicotine-1'-N-oxide to nicotine, but no nornicotine was obtained when the N-oxide was used as substrate.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.0006061719}

362	Tricin	WIKIPEDIA	Tricin is a chemical compound. It is an O-methylated flavone, a type of flavonoid. It can be found in rice bran and sugarcane. == Glycosides == Tricin 4'-glucoside (Tricin-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranaoside, CAS number 71855-50-0) Tricin 5-glucoside (Tricin 5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, CAS number 32769-00-9) Tricin 7-O-glucoside (Tricin 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, CAS number 32769-01-0) == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of flavones has not yet been elucidated in full; however, most of the mechanistic and enzymatic steps have been discovered and studied. In biosynthesizing tricin, there is first stepwise addition of malonyl-CoA via the polyketide pathway and p-coumaroyl-CoA via the phenylpropanoid pathway. These additions are mediated by the sequential action of chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase to yield naringenin chalcone and the flavanone, naringenin, respectively. CYP93G1 of the CYP450 superfamily in rice then desaturates naringenin into apigenin. After this step, it is proposed that flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3',5'H) changes apigenin into tricetin. Upon formation of tricetin, 3'-O-methyltransferase and 5'-O-methyltransferase add methoxy groups to tricetin to form tricin. == Other compounds formed from tricin == Three flavonolignans derived from tricin have been isolated from oats Avena sativa. == References ==	FOOD	FOOD	{'FO': -4.3202e-07, 'OD': 0.0}

367	Vitamin d3	WIKIPEDIA	"Cholecalciferol, also known as vitamin D3 or colecalciferol, is a type of vitamin D that is produced by the skin when exposed to UVB light; it is found in certain foods and can be taken as a dietary supplement. Cholecalciferol is synthesised in the skin following sunlight exposure. It is then converted in the liver to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol D), which is further converted in the kidney to calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol D). One of calcitriol’s most important functions is to promote calcium uptake by the intestines. Cholecalciferol is present in food such as fatty fish, beef liver, eggs, and cheese. In some countries, cholecalciferol is also added to products like plants, cow milk, fruit juice, yogurt, and margarine. Cholecalciferol can be taken orally as a dietary supplement to prevent vitamin D deficiency or as a medication to treat associated diseases, including rickets. It is also used in the management of familial hypophosphatemia, hypoparathyroidism that is causing low blood calcium, and Fanconi syndrome. Vitamin-D supplements may not be effective in people with severe kidney disease. Excessive doses in humans can result in vomiting, constipation, muscle weakness, and confusion. Other risks include kidney stones. Doses greater than 40000 IU (1000 μg) per day are generally required before high blood calcium occurs. Normal doses, 800–2000 IU per day, are safe in pregnancy. Cholecalciferol was first described in 1936. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 62nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10 million prescriptions. Cholecalciferol is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) appears to stimulate the body's interferon type I signaling system that protects against bacteria and viruses, unlike vitamin D2. === Vitamin D deficiency === Cholecalciferol is a form of vitamin D which is naturally synthesized in skin and functions as a pro-hormone, being converted to calcitriol. This is important for maintaining calcium levels and promoting bone health and development. As a medication, cholecalciferol may be taken as a dietary supplement to prevent or to treat vitamin D deficiency. One gram is 40000000 (40×106) IU, equivalently 1 IU is 0.025 μg, or 25 ng. Dietary reference intake values for vitamin D (ergocalciferol, which is D2, or cholecalciferol, which is D3), or both, have been established and recommendations vary depending on the country: In the US: 15 μg/d (600 IU/d) for all individuals (males, females, pregnant/lactating women) between the ages of 1 and 70 years, inclusive. For all individuals older than 70 years, 20 μg/d (800 IU/d) is recommended. In the EU: 15 μg/d (600 IU/d) for all people older than 1 year and 10 μg/d (400 IU/d) for infants aged 7–11 months, assuming minimal cutaneous vitamin D synthesis. In the UK: a ‘Safe Intake’ (SI) of 8.5–10 μg/d (340–400 IU/d) for infants < 1 year (including exclusively breastfed infants) and an SI of 10 μg/d (400 IU/d) for children aged 1 to <4 years; for all other population groups aged 4 years and more (including pregnant/lactating women) a Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) of day10 μg (400 IU/d). Low levels of vitamin D3 are more commonly found in individuals living in northern latitudes or with other reasons for a lack of regular sun exposure, including being housebound, frail, elderly, or obese, having darker skin, and wearing clothes that cover most of the skin. Supplements are recommended for these groups of people. The Institute of Medicine in 2010 recommended a maximum uptake of vitamin D of 4000 IU/d, finding that the dose for lowest observed adverse effect level is 40,000 IU daily for at least 12 weeks, and that there was a single case of toxicity above 10000 IU after more than seven years of daily intake; this case of toxicity occurred in circumstances that have led other researchers to dispute whether it is a credible case to consider when making vitamin D intake recommendations. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency will require treatment with a loading dose; its magnitude can be calculated based on the actual serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level and body weight. There are conflicting reports concerning the relative effectiveness of cholecalciferol (D3) versus ergocalciferol (D2), with some studies suggesting less efficacy of D2, and others showing no difference. There are differences in absorption, binding and inactivation of the two forms, with evidence usually favoring cholecalciferol in raising levels in blood, although more research is needed. A much less common use of cholecalciferol therapy in rickets utilizes a single large dose and has been called stoss therapy. Treatment is given either orally or by intramuscular injection of 300000 IU (7500 μg) to 500000 IU (12500 μg = 12.5 mg), in a single dose, or sometimes in two to four divided doses. There are concerns about the safety of such large doses. Low circulating vitamin D levels have been associated with lower total testosterone levels in males. Vitamin D supplementation could potentially improve total testosterone concentration, although more research is needed. === Other diseases === A meta-analysis of 2007 concluded that daily intake of 1000 to 2000 IU/d of vitamin D3 could reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer with minimal risk. Also a 2008 study published in Cancer Research has shown the addition of vitamin D3 (along with calcium) to the diet of some mice fed a regimen similar in nutritional content to a new Western diet with 1000 IU cholecalciferol per day prevented colon cancer development. In humans, with 400 IU daily, there was no effect of cholecalciferol supplements on the risk of colorectal cancer. Supplements are not recommended for prevention of cancer as any effects of cholecalciferol are very small. Although correlations exist between low levels of blood serum cholecalciferol and higher rates of various cancers, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, heart disease, and diabetes, the consensus is that supplementing levels is not beneficial. It is thought that tuberculosis may result in lower levels. It, however, is not entirely clear how the two are related. == Biochemistry == === Structure === Cholecalciferol is one of the five forms of vitamin D. Cholecalciferol is a secosteroid, that is, a steroid molecule with one ring open. === Mechanism of action === By itself cholecalciferol is inactive. It is converted to its active form by two hydroxylations: the first in the liver, by CYP2R1 or CYP27A1, to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol, 25-OH vitamin D3). The second hydroxylation occurs mainly in the kidney through the action of CYP27B1 to convert 25-OH vitamin D3 into 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol, 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3). All these metabolites are bound in blood to the vitamin D-binding protein. The action of calcitriol is mediated by the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear receptor which regulates the synthesis of hundreds of proteins and is present in virtually every cell in the body. === Biosynthesis === Click on icon in lower right corner to open. 7-Dehydrocholesterol is the precursor of cholecalciferol. Within the epidermal layer of skin, 7-dehydrocholesterol undergoes an electrocyclic reaction as a result of UVB light at wavelengths between 290 and 310 nm, with peak synthesis occurring at 293 nm. This results in the opening of the vitamin precursor B-ring through a conrotatory pathway making previtamin D3 (pre-cholecalciferol). In a process which is independent of UV light, the pre-cholecalciferol then undergoes a [1,7] antarafacial sigmatropic rearrangement and therein finally isomerizes to form vitamin D3. The active UVB wavelengths are little present in sunlight, and sufficient amounts of cholecalciferol can be produced with moderate exposure of the skin, depending on the strength of the sun. Time of day, season, latitude, and altitude affect the strength of the sun, and pollution, cloud cover or glass all reduce the amount of UVB exposure. Exposure of face, arms and legs, averaging 5–30 minutes twice per week, may be sufficient, but the darker the skin, and the weaker the sunlight, the more minutes of exposure are needed. Vitamin D overdose is impossible from UV exposure; the skin reaches an equilibrium where the vitamin degrades as fast as it is created. Cholecalciferol can be produced in skin from the light emitted by the UV lamps in tanning beds, which produce ultraviolet primarily in the UVA spectrum, but typically produce 4% to 10% of the total UV emissions as UVB. Levels in blood are higher in frequent users of tanning salons. A 293 nanometer UVB light emitting diode (LED) was found to be 2.4 times more efficient in producing vitamin D3 than the sun in less than 1⁄60 the time. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28904394/). Whether cholecalciferol and all forms of vitamin D are by definition ""vitamins"" can be disputed, since the definition of vitamins includes that the substance cannot be synthesized by the body and must be ingested. Cholecalciferol is synthesized by the body during UVB radiation exposure. The three steps in the synthesis and activation of vitamin D3 are regulated as follows: Cholecalciferol is synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol under the action of ultraviolet B (UVB) light. It reaches an equilibrium after several minutes depending on the intensity of the UVB in the sunlight – determined by latitude, season, cloud cover, and altitude – and the age and degree of pigmentation of the skin. Hydroxylation in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver hepatocytes of cholecalciferol to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) by 25-hydroxylase is loosely regulated, if at all, and blood levels of this molecule largely reflect the amount of cholecalciferol produced in the skin combined with any vitamin D2 or D3 ingested. Hydroxylation in the kidneys of calcifediol to calcitriol by 1-alpha-hydroxylase is tightly regulated: it is stimulated by parathyroid hormone and serves as the major control point in the production of the active circulating hormone calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3). == Industrial production == Cholecalciferol is produced industrially for use in vitamin supplements and to fortify foods. As a pharmaceutical drug it is called cholecalciferol (USAN) or colecalciferol (INN, BAN). It is produced by the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol extracted from lanolin found in sheep's wool. Cholesterol is extracted from wool grease and wool wax alcohols obtained from the cleaning of wool after shearing. The cholesterol undergoes a four-step process to make 7-dehydrocholesterol, the same compound that is produced in the skin of animals. The 7-dehydrocholesterol is then irradiated with ultraviolet light. Some unwanted isomers are formed during irradiation: these are removed by various techniques, leaving a resin which melts at about room temperature and usually has a potency of 25000000 to 30000000 International Units/gram. Cholecalciferol is also produced industrially for use in vitamin supplements from lichens, which is suitable for vegans. == Stability == Cholecalciferol is very sensitive to UV radiation and will rapidly, but reversibly, break down to form supra-sterols, which can further irreversibly convert to ergosterol. == Pesticide == Rodents are somewhat more susceptible to high doses than other species, and cholecalciferol has been used in poison bait for the control of these pests. The mechanism of high dose cholecalciferol is that it can produce ""hypercalcemia, which results in systemic calcification of soft tissue, leading to kidney failure, cardiac abnormalities, hypertension, CNS depression, and GI upset. Signs generally develop within 18–36 h of ingestion and can include depression, loss of appetite, polyuria, and polydipsia."" High-dose cholecalciferol will tend to rapidly accumulate in adipose tissue yet release more slowly which will tend to delay time of death for several days from the time that high-dose bait is introduced. In New Zealand, possums have become a significant pest animal. For possum control, cholecalciferol has been used as the active ingredient in lethal baits. The LD50 is 16.8 mg/kg, but only 9.8 mg/kg if calcium carbonate is added to the bait. Kidneys and heart are target organs. LD50 of 4.4 mg/kg has been reported in rabbits, with lethality to almost all rabbits ingesting doses greater than 15 mg/kg. Toxicity has been reported across a wide range of cholecalciferol dosages, with LD50 as high as 88 mg/kg or LDLo as low as 2 mg/kg reported for dogs. Researchers have reported that the compound is less toxic to non-target species than earlier generations of anticoagulant rodenticides (Warfarin and congeners) or Bromethalin, and that relay toxicosis (poisoning by eating a poisoned animal) has not been documented. Nevertheless, the same source reports that use of cholecalciferol in rodenticides may still pose a significant hazard to other animals, such as dogs and cats, when rodenticide bait or other forms of cholecalciferol are directly ingested. == See also == Hypervitaminosis D, Vitamin D poisoning Ergocalciferol, vitamin D2 25-Hydroxyvitamin D 1-alpha-hydroxylase, a kidney enzyme that converts calcifediol to calcitriol == References == == External links == Ultraviolet B Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) Are More Efficient and Effective in Producing Vitamin D3 in Human Skin Compared to Natural Sunlight NIST Chemistry WebBook page for cholecalciferol Vitamin D metabolism, sex hormones, and male reproductive function."

371	Taurohyodeoxycholic acid	PUBMED	 Taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA), a natural 6α-hydroxylated bile acid, exhibits intestinal anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of THDCA on ulcerative colitis and to reveal its mechanisms of action. Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) to mice. Mice in the treatment group were gavage THDCA (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day) or sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg/day) or azathioprine (10 mg/kg/day). The pathologic markers of colitis were comprehensively assessed. The levels of Th1-/Th2-/Th17-/Treg-related inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors were detected by ELISA, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. The balance of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg cells was analyzed by Flow cytometry. THDCA significantly alleviated colitis by improving the body weight, colon length, spleen weight, histological characteristics, and MPO activity of colitis mice. THDCA reduced the secretion of Th1-/Th17-related cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, and TNF-α) and the expressions of transcription factors (T-bet, STAT4, RORγt, and STAT3), but increase the production of Th2-/Treg-related cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1) and the expressions of transcription factors (GATA3, STAT6, Foxp3, and Smad3) in the colon. Meanwhile, THDCA inhibited the expressions of IFN-γ, IL-17A, T-bet, and RORγt, but improved the expression of IL-4, IL-10, GATA3, and Foxp3 in the spleen. Furthermore, THDCA restored the proportion of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells, and balanced the Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg immune response of colitis mice. THDCA can alleviate TNBS-induced colitis via regulating Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance, which may represent a promising treatment for patients with colitis. The prevention of the hepatotoxic effects produced by intravenous infusion of taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) by coinfusion with taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA) was evaluated in bile fistula rats; the hepatoprotective effects of the latter were also compared with those of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). Rats infused with TCDCA at a dose of 8 micromol/min/kg showed reduced bile flow and calcium secretion, as well as increased biliary release of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This was associated with a very low biliary secretion rate of TCDCA (approximately 1 micromol/min/kg). Simultaneous infusion of THDCA or TUDCA at the same dose preserved bile flow and almost totally abolished the pathological leakage of the two enzymes into bile. The effect was slightly more potent for THDCA. The maximum secretion rate of TCDCA increased to the highest value (8 micromol/min/kg) when coinfused with either of the two hepatoprotective bile acids (BA), which were efficiently and completely secreted in the bile, without metabolism. Calcium output was also restored and phospholipid (PL) secretion increased with respect to the control saline infusion. This increase was higher in the THDCA study. These data show that THDCA is highly effective in the prevention of hepatotoxicity induced by intravenous infusion of TCDCA by facilitating its biliary secretion and reducing its hepatic residence time; this was associated with selective stimulation of PL biliary secretion. This study aimed to determine the effect in humans of taurohyodeoxycholic acid, a 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acid with hydrophilic properties, on bile lipid secretion. Four cholecystectomized patients who had gallstones and an interrupted enterohepatic circulation were intraduodenally infused with taurohyodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids on separate occasions at a dose of 0.8 to 1 g/h for 3 hours. In hourly bile samples collected for 8 hours after the beginning of the infusion, biliary bile acid composition (by high-performance liquid chromatography), biliary lipid concentrations (by standard methods), and distribution of biliary carriers (by gel chromatography) were evaluated. Blood liver function tests were performed before and after the infusions. Taurohyodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids became the predominant biliary bile acids in all patients except for one infused with taurohyodeoxycholic acid. Taurohyodeoxycholic acid stimulated significantly greater (P < .05) cholesterol and phospholipid secretion per unit of secreted bile acid (0.098 and 0.451 micromol/micromol, respectively) compared with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (0.061 micromol/micromol for cholesterol and 0.275 micromol/micromol for phospholipids). The secretory ratio between phospholipid and cholesterol was significantly higher after infusion of taurohyodeoxycholic acid (3.88 micromol/micromol) compared with taroursodeoxycholic acid (3.09 micromol/micromol) (P < .05). Biliary enrichment with taurohyodeoxycholic acid was positively related with percent concentration of phospholipids but not with that of cholesterol. The opposite trend was observed in tauroursodeoxycholic acid-enriched biles. In both taurohyodeoxycholic acid- and tauroursodeoxycholic acid-rich bile, 80% to 90% of cholesterol was carried in a gel-chromatographic fraction corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 80 to 200 kd. No alteration in liver function test results was observed after taurohyodeoxycholic acid infusion. In conclusion, taurohyodeoxycholic acid stimulates greater cholesterol and phospholipid secretion than tauroursodeoxycholic acid, but with a higher phospholipid/cholesterol secretory ratio. In bile enriched with both bile acids, biliary cholesterol is transported in non-micellar aggregates. Finally, in the conditions of our study, taurohyodeoxycholic acid was not hepatotoxic.

380	Antipyrine	WIKIPEDIA	"Phenazone (INN and BAN; also known as phenazon, antipyrine (USAN), antipyrin, or analgesine) is an analgesic (pain reducing), antipyretic (fever reducing) and anti-inflammatory drug. While it predates the term, it is often classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Phenazone was one of the earliest synthetic medications — when it was patented in 1883, the only synthetic medical chemicals on the market were chloral hydrate, a sedative (as well as at least one derivative of that chemical), trimethylamine, and iodol (tetraiodopyrrol), an early antiseptic. One of the earliest widely used analgesics and antipyretics, phenazone was gradually replaced in common use by other medications including phenacetin (itself later withdrawn because of safety concerns), aspirin, paracetamol and modern NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. However, it is still available in several countries either as an over-the-counter or prescribed drug. == History == Ludwig Knorr was the first to synthesize phenazone, then called antipyrine, in the early 1880s. Sources disagree on the exact year of discovery, but Knorr patented the chemical in 1883.: 26–27 Phenazone has an elimination half life of about 12 hours. == Preparation == Phenazone is synthesized by condensation of phenylhydrazine and ethyl acetoacetate under basic conditions and methylation of the resulting intermediate compound 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazolone with dimethyl sulfate or methyl iodide. It crystallizes in needles which melt at 156 °C (313 °F). Potassium permanganate oxidizes it to pyridazine tetracarboxylic acid. == Adverse effects == Possible adverse effects include: Allergy to pyrazolones Nausea Agranulocytosis Hepatotoxicity == Research == Phenazone is often used in testing the effects of other drugs or diseases on drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. == See also == A/B Otic Drops, ear drops combined with benzocaine to relieve pain and remove cerumen Propyphenazone == References == Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

385	Indigotindisulfonic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Indigo carmine, or 5,5′-indigodisulfonic acid sodium salt, is an organic salt derived from indigo by aromatic sulfonation, which renders the compound soluble in water. Like indigo, it produces a blue color, and is used in food and other consumables, cosmetics, and as a medical contrast agent and staining agent; it also acts as a pH indicator. It is approved for human consumption in the United States and European Union. It has the E number E132, and is named Blue No. 2 by the US Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. == Uses == Indigo carmine in a 0.2% aqueous solution is blue at pH 11.4 and yellow at 13.0. Indigo carmine is also a redox indicator, turning yellow upon reduction. Another use is as a dissolved ozone indicator through the conversion to isatin-5-sulfonic acid. This reaction has been shown not to be specific to ozone: it also detects superoxide, an important distinction in cell physiology. It is also used as a dye in the manufacturing of capsules. === Medical uses === Indigotindisulfonate sodium, sold under the brand name Bludigo, is used as a contrast agent during surgical procedures. It is indicated for use in cystoscopy in adults following urological and gynecological procedures. It was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2022. In obstetric surgery, it may be used to detect amniotic fluid leaks. In urologic surgery, intravenous indigo carmine can be used to highlight portions of the urinary tract. The dye is filtered rapidly by the kidneys from the blood, and colors the urine blue. However, the dye can cause a potentially dangerous acute increase in blood pressure in some cases. Indigo carmine stain is not absorbed into cells, so it is applied to tissues to enhance the visibility of mucosa. This leads to its use for examination and diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions and growths on mucosal surfaces of the body. === Food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and scientific uses === Indigo carmine is one of the few blue food colorants. Others include the anthocyanidins and rare entites such as variagatic acid and popolohuanone. == Safety and regulation == Indigo carmin shows ""genotoxicity, developmental toxicity or modifications of haematological parameters in chronic toxicity studies"".

A 2018 systematic review found no consistent performance difference between DEET and icaridin in field studies and concluded that they are equally preferred mosquito repellents, noting that 50% DEET offers longer protection but is not available in some countries. === Concentrations === The concentration of DEET in products may range from less than 10% to nearly 100%, but concentrations greater than 50% do not increase the duration of protection. Higher concentrations can be safely applied to clothing, although it may damage some types of synthetic fibers. In the United Kingdom, the publicly-funded healthcare system, the National Health Service (NHS), recommends that UK citizens should use a concentration of 50% when visiting areas of the world with malaria. A lower concentration of 10% is recommended for infants and children. Health Canada decided to limit DEET concentration to 30% in the country since 2002 due to an increased long-term risk observed with repeated applications. DEET is often sold and used in spray or lotion in concentrations up to 100%. Consumer Reports found a correlation between DEET concentration and hours of protection against insect bites. 100% DEET was found to offer up to 12 hours of protection while several lower concentration DEET formulations (20–34%) offered 3–6 hours of protection. Other research has corroborated the effectiveness of DEET. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 30–50% DEET to prevent the spread of pathogens carried by insects. A 2008 study found that higher concentrations of DEET have an improved ability to repel insects through fabric. == Contraindications == DEET should not be used on children younger than 2 months of age. == Adverse effects == When used as directed, products containing between 10% and 30% DEET have been found by the American Academy of Pediatrics to be safe to use on children as well as adults. As a precaution, manufacturers advise that DEET products should not be used under clothing or on damaged skin, and that preparations be washed off after they are no longer needed or between applications. DEET can irritate the eyes and, unlike icaridin, it can cause breathing difficulty, headaches, or, in rare cases, it may cause severe epidermal reactions. The authors of a 2002 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine wrote: ... this repellent has been subjected to more scientific and toxicologic scrutiny than any other repellent substance. ... DEET has a remarkable safety profile after 40 years of use and nearly 8 billion human applications. Fewer than 50 cases of serious toxic effects have been documented in ... medical literature since 1960 ... Many of these cases of toxic effects involved long-term, heavy, frequent, or whole-body application of DEET. No correlation has been found between the concentration of DEET used and the risk of toxic effects. ... When applied with common sense, DEET-based repellents can be expected to provide a safe as well as a long-lasting repellent effect ... under circumstances in which it is crucial to be protected against arthropod bites that might transmit disease. In the DEET Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) in 1998, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported 14 to 46 cases of potential DEET-associated seizures, including four deaths. The EPA states: ""... it does appear that some cases are likely related to DEET toxicity,"" which may underreport the risk as physicians may fail to check for history of DEET use or fail to report cases of seizure subsequent to DEET use. In 1997, the Pesticide Information Project of Cooperative Extension Offices of Cornell University stated that ""Everglades National Park employees having extensive DEET exposure were more likely to have insomnia, mood disturbances and impaired cognitive function than lesser exposed co-workers"". Citing human health reasons, Health Canada barred the sale of insect repellents for human use that contained more than 30% DEET in a 2002 re-evaluation ""based on a human health risk assessment that considered daily application of DEET over a prolonged period of time"". The agency recommended that DEET-based products be used on children between the ages of 2 and 12 only if the concentration of DEET is 10% or less and that repellents be applied no more than 3 times a day, children under 2 should not receive more than 1 application of repellent in a day and DEET-based products of any concentration should not be used on infants under 6 months. A 2020 study performed by students within the University of Florida's College of Public Health and Health Professions analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and identified 1,205 participants who had ""DEET metabolic levels recorded at or above detection limits"". They analyzed biomarkers related to systemic inflammation, immune, liver, and kidney functions, and found no ""evidence that DEET exposure has any impact on the biomarkers identified."" === Detection in body fluids === DEET may be measured in blood, plasma, or urine by gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma DEET concentrations are expected to be in a range of 0.3–3.0 mg/L during the first 8 hours after dermal application in persons using the chemical appropriately, >6 mg/L in intoxicated patients and >100 mg/L in victims of acute intentional oral overdose. == Overdose == Applying DEET to the skin is safe if done as directed. Adverse reactions are very rare, about 1 in 100 million people. However, repeated use of DEET in very high concentrations can lead to toxic encephalopathy with severe neurological symptoms including seizures, tremors and slurred speech. The risk is higher for children since they have a greater surface area to body weight ratio. == Interactions == Limited data indicates that combining insect repellents with DEET and sunscreen decreases the sun protection factor of the sunscreen by about a third. Unlike icaridin, the combination also increases the absorption of both significantly. When the two need to be used together, the repellent should be applied after the sunscreen has been absorbed, about 30 or more minutes later. When DEET is used in combination with insecticides for cockroaches it can strengthen the toxicity of carbamate, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. These 1996 findings indicate that DEET has neurological effects on insects in addition to known olfactory effects, and that its toxicity is strengthened in combination with other insecticides. == Damage to materials == Unlike icaridin, DEET is an effective solvent and may dissolve some watch crystals, plastics, rayon, spandex, other synthetic fabrics, and painted or varnished surfaces including nail polish. It also may act as a plasticizer by remaining inside some formerly hard plastics, leaving them softened and more flexible. DEET is incompatible with rayon, acetate, or dynel clothing. == Environmental impact == Though DEET is not expected to bioaccumulate, it has been found to have a slight toxicity for fresh-water fish such as rainbow trout and tilapia, and it also has been shown to be toxic for some species of freshwater zooplankton. DEET has been detected at low concentrations in water bodies as a result of production and use, such as in the Mississippi River and its tributaries, where a 1991 study detected levels varying from 5 to 201 ng/L. A 1975 study analyzed the effects of DEET on communities of freshwater organisms native to Chinese waterways and found that DEET was moderately toxic to aquatic organisms compared to other commercial insect repellants. The most-at-risk organisms were algae colonies which often experienced ""significant biomass decline and community composition shift[s]"" when exposed to DEET at 500 ng/L. DEET is biodegraded by fungi into products less toxic to zooplankton. It degrades well under aerobic conditions, but poorly and slowly under anaerobic conditions. == Mechanism of action == DEET is thought to provide protection from mosquitos via two pathways, both by negatively impacting mosquito odorant receptors at a distance, and by negatively impacting mosquito chemoreceptors upon contact. The exact mechanisms are still being researched, but the two most likely hypotheses are the ""smell and avoid hypothesis"" (that DEET has an unpleasant odor to insects), and the ""bewilderment hypothesis"" (that smelling DEET confuses insects). An alternative hypothesis is that DEET ""masks"" humans by reducing the volatility of skin odorants that are attractive to insects. == Synthesis == A slightly yellow liquid at room temperature, it can be prepared by converting m-toluic acid (3-methylbenzoic acid) to the corresponding acyl chloride using thionyl chloride (SOCl2), and then allowing that product to react with diethylamine: == History == DEET was developed in 1944 by Samuel Gertler of the United States Department of Agriculture for use by the United States Army, following its experience of jungle warfare during World War II. It was originally tested as a pesticide on farm fields, and entered military use in 1946 and civilian use in 1957. It was used in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. In its original form, known as ""bug juice"", the application solution was composed of 75% DEET and 25% ethanol. Later, a new version of the repellent was developed by the U.S. Army and the USDA. This formulation consisted of DEET and a mixture of polymers that extended its release and reduced its evaporation rate. This extended-release application was registered by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1991. == See also == Beautyberry Citronella oil DDT, another insecticide used for disease vector control Ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535) Icaridin Lemon eucalyptus Mosquito coil p-Menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) Permethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide that can be applied to clothing to help prevent bites SS220 Anthranilate-based insect repellents == References == == Further reading == == External links == DEET General Fact Sheet - National Pesticide Information Center DEET Technical Fact Sheet – National Pesticide Information Center West Nile Virus Resource Guide – National Pesticide Information Center Health Advisory: Tick and Insect Repellents, New York State US Centers for Disease Control information on DEET US Environmental Protection Agency information on DEET Review of scientific literature on DEET Archived 2016-12-10 at the Wayback Machine (from a RAND Corporation report on Gulf War illnesses) Health Canada - Re-evaluation Decision Document: Personal insect repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide and related compounds), 2002"	PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL	PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL	{'PERSON': -0.00015490896, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': -3.1281633e-07, ',': -0.01047525, ' IND': -0.0009564822, 'UST': -3.1281633e-07, 'RI': 0.0}

408	Chrysosplenol c	PUBMED	 Naturally found chrysosplenol-C (4',5,6-trihydroxy-3,3',7-trimethoxyflavone) increases the contractility of cardiac myocytes independent of  Chrysosplenol C (4',5,6-trihydroxy-3,3',7-trimethoxyflavone) is a flavone contained in several medicinal plants including Miliusa balansae and Pterocaulon sphacelatum. This compound is known to have an antiviral effect and show cytotoxic activity in several cell lines. In the present study, we explored the effect of chrysosplenol C on contractility in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes. Chrysosplenol C was isolated from M. balansae, and cell shortenings were measured in field-stimulated single myocytes using a video edge detection method at room temperature. Chrysosplenol C was found to increase cell shortenings in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal effective concentration of 45 ± 7.8 μM. Maximal effect of chrysosplenol C, approximately 185% of control, was observed at ≥80 μM. The positive inotropic effect caused by chrysosplenol C was reversible. Time-to-peak contraction and time-to-relengthening were significantly increased by chrysosplenol C. The velocity of cell shortening was slightly accelerated, whereas that of relaxation was not altered by chrysosplenol C. The chrysosplenol C–induced positive inotropic effect was not inhibited by propranolol posttreatment or H-89 pretreatment, suggesting that chrysosplenol C increased contraction independently of β-adrenergic receptor stimulation and protein kinase A. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that chrysosplenol C is a positive inotropic agent in cardiac myocytes. Chrysosplenol C (4',5,6-trihydroxy-3,3',7-trimethoxyflavone) isolated from Miliusa balansae has unique structural features as a reversible inotropic agent independent of β-adrenergic signaling and with selective activation of cardiac myosin ATPase. Hence, a series of chrysosplenol analogues were synthesized and explored for identification of pharmacophore that is essential for the increasing contractility in rat ventricular myocytes. Analogue 7-chloro-2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methoxy-4H-chromen-4-one showed highly potent contractility (54.8% at 10 μM) through activating cardiac myosin ATPase (38.7% at 10 μM). Our systematic structure-activity relationship study revealed that flavonoid nucleus of chrososplenol C appears to be an essential basic skeleton and hydrophobic substituent at position 7 of chromenone such as methoxy or chloro enhances the activity. Additionally, our ATPase study suggested that these chrysosplenol analogues have selectivity toward cardiac myosin activation. Thus, the novel flavonone with 3-/7-hydrophobic substituent and 3'-hydrogen bonding donor function is a novel scaffold for discovery of a new positive inotropic agent.

409	4-cholesten-3-one	PUBMED	 (+)4-cholesten-3-one has been proved to have potential wound healing effect in the process of wound regeneration. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of (+)4-cholesten-3-one/sodium alginate/gelatin on skin injury and reveal its potential molecular mechanism. First, we prepared sodium alginate/gelatin hydrogel (SA/Gel hydrogel) with different ratios and tested their characteristics. Based on these results, different concentrations of (+)4-cholesten-3-one were added into SA/Gel hydrogel. A full-thickness skin injury model was successfully established to evaluate wound healing activity In this paper, we report the results of treating cells with an effective small molecule, (+)4-cholesten-3-one (PubChem CID: 91477), which can promote neural stem cell(NSC) differentiation into dopaminergic neurons. This study used rat neural stem cells stimulated with two different concentrations (7.8 μM and 78 μM) of (+)4-cholesten-3-one. Cell phenotypic analysis showed that (+)4-cholesten-3-one induced NSC differentiation into dopaminergic neurons, and the level of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH), which is specific for dopaminergic cells, was significantly increased compared with that of the drug-free control group. Furthermore, in this study, we found that this effect may be related to the transcription factor fork-head box a2 (FoxA2) and ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1). The expression of TET1 and FoxA2 was upregulated after treatment with (+)4-cholesten-3-one. To verify the relationship between (+)4-cholesten-3-one and these genes, we found that the binding rate of TET1 and FoxA2 increased after the application of (+)4-cholesten-3-one, as confirmed by a coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. With a small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiment, we found that only when Tet1 and Foxa2 were not silenced was the mRNA level of Th increased after (+)4-cholesten-3-one treatment. Taken together, these data show that (+)4-cholesten-3-one can promote the differentiation of NSCs into dopaminergic neurons by upregulating the expression of TET1 and FoxA2 and by increasing their binding. Thus, (+)4-cholesten-3-one may help address the application of neural stem cell replacement therapy in neurodegenerative diseases. Metastasis is a great challenge in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) therapy. Cholesterol has been implicated in ADC metastasis. 4-cholesten-3-one, as cholesterol metabolite and analog, can substitute membrane cholesterol and increase membrane fluidity. In this study, we explored the possibility that 4-cholesten-3-one inhibited ADC metastasis. Low-dose 4-cholesten-3-one significantly restrained ADC cells migration and invasion with little effects on cells viabilities. Further investigation showed that 4-cholesten-3-one promoted ROS generation, which transiently activated AMPKα1, increased HIF1α expression, reduced Bcl-2 expression and caused autophagy. AMPKα1 knockdown partly suppressed 4-cholesten-3-one-induced autophagy but, neither prevented 4-cholesten-3-one-induced upregulation of HIF1α or downregulation of Bcl-2. 4-cholesten-3-one-induced autophagy facilitated the release of HMGB1 from nuclei to cytoplasm, blocking nuclear translocation of HIF1α and activation of MMP2 and MMP9. Also, 4-cholesten-3-one induced time-dependent phosphorylation of caveolin-1, Akt and NF-κB. With increasing treatment time, 4-cholesten-3-one accelerated caveolin-1 internalization, but reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and NF-κB, and inhibited the expression of snail and twist. These data suggested that 4-cholesten-3-one could be a potential candidate for anti-metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.066227004, 'ICAL': 0.0}

418	Hydrocortisone	WIKIPEDIA	"Hydrocortisone is the name for the hormone cortisol when supplied as a medication. It is a corticosteroid and works as an anti-inflammatory and by immune suppression. Uses include conditions such as adrenocortical insufficiency, adrenogenital syndrome, high blood calcium, thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, asthma, and COPD. It is the treatment of choice for adrenocortical insufficiency. It can be given by mouth, topically, or by injection. Stopping treatment after long-term use should be done slowly. Side effects may include mood changes, increased risk of infection, and edema (swelling). With long-term use, common side effects include osteoporosis, upset stomach, physical weakness, easy bruising, and candidiasis (yeast infections). It is unclear if it is safe for use during pregnancy. Hydrocortisone was patented in 1936 and approved for medical use in 1941. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 202nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Hydrocortisone is the pharmaceutical term for cortisol used in oral administration, intravenous injection, or topical application. It is used as an immunosuppressive drug, given by injection in the treatment of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema, in place of prednisolone in patients needing steroid treatment but unable to take oral medication, and perioperatively in patients on long-term steroid treatment to prevent an adrenal crisis. It may also be injected into inflamed joints resulting from diseases such as gout. It may be used topically for allergic rashes, eczema, psoriasis, itching, and other inflammatory skin conditions. Topical hydrocortisone creams and ointments are available in most countries without prescription in strengths ranging from 0.05% to 2.5% (depending on local regulations) with stronger forms available by prescription only. It may also be used rectally in suppositories to relieve the swelling, itch, and irritation in hemorrhoids. It may be used as an acetate form (hydrocortisone acetate), which has slightly different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid, acting specifically as both a glucocorticoid and as a mineralocorticoid. That is, it is an agonist of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Hydrocortisone has low potency relative to synthetic corticosteroids. Compared to hydrocortisone, prednisolone is about 4 times as potent and dexamethasone about 40 times as potent in terms of anti-inflammatory effect. Prednisolone can also be used as cortisol replacement, and at replacement dose levels (rather than anti-inflammatory levels), prednisolone is about 8 times more potent than cortisol. The equivalent doses and relative potencies of hydrocortisone compared to various other synthetic corticosteroids have also been reviewed and summarized. The endogenous production rate of cortisol is approximately 5.7 to 9.9 mg/m2 per day, which corresponds to an oral hydrocortisone dose of approximately 15 to 20 mg/day (for a 70-kg person). One review described daily cortisol production of 10 mg in healthy volunteers and reported that daily cortisol production could increase up to 400 mg in conditions of severe stress (e.g., surgery). The total and/or free concentrations of cortisol/hydrocortisone required for various glucocorticoid effects have been determined. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The bioavailability of oral hydrocortisone is about 96% ± 20% (SD). The pharmacokinetics of hydrocortisone are non-linear. The peak level of oral hydrocortisone is 15.3 ± 2.9 (SD) μg/L per 1 mg dose. The time to peak concentrations of oral hydrocortisone is 1.2 ± 0.4 (SD) hours. The topical percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone varies widely depending on experimental circumstances and has been reported to range from 0.5 to 14.9% in different studies. Some skin application sites, like the scrotum and vulva, absorb hydrocortisone much more efficiently than other application sites, like the forearm. In one study, the amount of hydrocortisone absorbed ranged from 0.2% to 36.2% depending on the application site, with the ball of the foot having the lowest absorption and the scrotum having the highest absorption. The absorption of hydrocortisone by the vulva has ranged from 4.4 to 8.1%, relative to 1.3 to 2.8% for the arm, in different studies and subjects. ==== Distribution ==== Most cortisol in the blood (all but about 4%) is bound to proteins, including corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) and serum albumin. A pharmacokinetic review stated that 92% ± 2% (SD) (92–93%) of hydrocortisone is plasma protein-bound. Free cortisol passes easily through cellular membranes. Inside cells it interacts with corticosteroid receptors. ==== Metabolism ==== Hydrocortisone is metabolized by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs) into cortisone, an inactive metabolite. It is additionally 5α-, 5β-, and 3α-reduced into dihydrocortisols, dihydrocortisones, tetrahydrocortisols, and tetrahydrocortisones. ==== Elimination ==== The elimination half-life of hydrocortisone ranges from about 1.2 to 2.0 (SD) hours, with an average of around 1.5 hours, regardless of oral versus parenteral administration. The duration of action of systemic hydrocortisone has been listed as 8 to 12 hours. == Chemistry == Hydrocortisone, also known as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid. A variety of hydrocortisone esters exist and have been marketed for medical use. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In March 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Efmody, intended for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in people aged twelve years and older. The applicant for this medicinal product is Diurnal Europe BV. Hydrocortisone (Efmody) was approved for medical use in the European Union, in May 2021, for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in people aged twelve years and older. === Anti-competitive practices === In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) concluded an investigation into the supply of hydrocortisone tablets, finding that from October 2008 onwards, drug suppliers Auden McKenzie and Actavis plc had charged ""excessive and unfair prices"" for 10mg and 20mg tablets and entered into agreements with potential competitors, paying companies who agreed not to enter the hydrocortisone market and enabling Auden McKenzie and Actavis to supply the drugs as ""generic"" rather than branded products and thereby escape price controls until eventually other companies entered the market. Auden and Actavis overcharged the UK's National Health Service for over ten years. Fines totalling over £255m were levied against the companies involved in this breach of competition law. == Research == === COVID-19 === Hydrocortisone was found to be effective in reducing mortality rate of critically ill COVID-19 patients when compared to other usual care or a placebo. == References =="	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	{'MED': -0.0076556075, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -1.504853e-06, ' EN': -0.00020628207, 'DO': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}

425	7alpha-hydroxycholesterol	PUBMED	 Glucocorticoids suppress the vascular inflammation that occurs under hypercholesterolemia, as demonstrated in an animal model fed a high-cholesterol diet. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects remain poorly understood. Because cholesterol is oxidized to form cholesterol oxides (oxysterols) that are capable of inducing inflammation, we investigated whether glucocorticoids affect the immune responses evoked by 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7αOHChol). The treatment of human THP-1 monocytic cells with dexamethasone (Dex) and prednisolone (Pdn) downregulated the expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as TLR6 and CD14, and diminished 7αOHChol-enhanced response to FSL-1, a TLR2/6 ligand, and lipopolysaccharide, which interacts with CD14 to initiate immune responses, as determined by the reduced secretion of IL-23 and CCL2, respectively. Glucocorticoids weakened the 7αOHChol-induced production of CCL2 and CCR5 ligands, which was accompanied by decreased migration of monocytic cells and CCR5-expressing Jurkat T cells. Treatment with Dex or Pdn also reduced the phosphorylation of the Akt-1 Src, ERK1/2, and p65 subunits. These results indicate that both Dex and Pdn impair the expression of PRRs and their downstream products, chemokine production, and phosphorylation of signaling molecules. Collectively, glucocorticoids suppress the innate immune response and activation of monocytic cells to an inflammatory phenotype enhanced or induced by 7αOHChol, which may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects in hypercholesterolemic conditions. Th1 lymphocytes are predominant in atherosclerotic lesions. However, mechanisms involved in the Th1 predominance are unknown. We have investigated the possibility of Th1 lymphocyte recruitment in a cholesterol-rich milieu. A high cholesterol diet resulted in enhanced expression of CCR5 ligands, including CCL3 and CCL4, but not of proatherogenic CXCR3 ligands, in atherosclerotic arteries of ApoE(-/-) mice. 27-Hydroxycholesterol and 7α-hydroxycholesterol, cholesterol oxides (oxysterols) detected in abundance in atherosclerotic lesions, greatly induced the transcription of CCL3 and CCL4 genes in addition to enhancing secretion of corresponding proteins by THP-1 monocytic cells. However, an identical or even higher concentration of cholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholsterol did not influence expression of these chemokines. Conditioned media containing the CCR5 ligands secreted from THP-1 cells induced migration of Jurkat T cells expressing CCR5, a characteristic chemokine receptor of Th1 cells, but not of Jurkat T cells that do not express CCR5. The migration of CCR5-expressing Jurkat T cells was abrogated in the presence of a CCR5-neutralizing antibody. 27-Hydroxycholesterol and 7α-hydroxycholesterol enhanced phosphorylation of Akt. Pharmacological inhibitors of phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathways blocked transcription as well as secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 in conjunction with attenuated migration of CCR5-expressing Jurkat T cells. This is the first report on the involvement of cholesterol oxides in migration of distinct subtype of T cells. We propose that 27-hydroxycholesterol and 7α-hydroxycholesterol can trigger a sequence of events that leads to recruitment of Th1 lymphocytes and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathways play a major role in the process.

431	N-lauroyl-dl-glutamic acid	PUBMED	 Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

432	Tyr-pro	PUBMED	 The transport and accumulation of orally administered functional food-derived peptides in the brain was not fully explored. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to provide critical evidence regarding brain accumulation of a memory-improving soy dipeptide, Tyr-Pro, following oral administration. Stable isotope-labeled Tyr-Pro (Tyr-[ The dipeptide Tyr-Pro has physiological potential for intact transportability into the brain parenchyma, prevention of cognitive impairment, and an adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) agonistic effect. The present study aimed to understand the effect of Tyr-Pro on the acetylcholine (ACh) nervous system and its underlying mechanism in NE-4C nerve cells. Concentration-dependent ACh production was induced by stimulation with Tyr-Pro and AdipoRon (an AdipoR1 agonist), along with the expression of AdipoR1 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in NE-4C cells. By knocking down AdipoR1 in the cells, Tyr-Pro promoted ChAT expression, along with the activations of AMPK and ERK 1/2. Tyr-Pro did not alter acetylcholinesterase or ACh receptors, indicating that the dipeptide might operate as an ACh accelerator in nerve cells. This study provides the first evidence that the AdipoR1 agonistic Tyr-Pro is a promising dipeptide responsible for the stimulation of the ACh nervous system by AdipoR1-induced ChAT activation. In our previous study, yeast-derived peptide Tyr-Pro-Leu-Pro (YPLP) was found to prolong treadmill time and relieve muscle fatigue in ICR mice. The present study aimed to further investigate the antifatigue mechanism of YPLP. Three doses of YPLP (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg·d) were given to exercise mice for 4 weeks. Results showed that YPLP reduced the oxidative response via the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway and promoted energy metabolism through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Label-free proteomics results showed that 81 differential abundance proteins (DAPs) were regulated by high-dose YPLP. These DAPs belonged to proteasome, mitochondrial, and muscle proteins. YPLP was mainly involved in proteasome, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, focal adhesion, and MAPK signal pathways to enhance muscle endurance. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting results proved that YPLP upregulated Psmd14 expression and downregulated p38 MAPK expression. Overall, this study revealed the mechanism behind YPLP to alleviate exercise fatigue.

436	Ursodeoxycholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	"Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also known as ursodiol, is a secondary bile acid, produced in humans and most other species from metabolism by intestinal bacteria. It is synthesized in the liver in some species, and was first identified in bile of bears of genus Ursus, from which its name derived. In purified form, it has been used to treat or prevent several diseases of the liver or bile ducts. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == UDCA has been used as medical therapy in gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) and for biliary sludge. UDCA helps reduce the cholesterol saturation of bile and leads to gradual dissolution of cholesterol-rich gallstones. UDCA may be given after bariatric surgery to prevent cholelithiasis, which commonly occurs due to the rapid weight loss producing biliary cholesterol oversaturation and also biliary dyskinesia secondary to hormonal changes. === Primary biliary cholangitis === UDCA is used as therapy in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC; previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis) where it can produce an improvement in biomarkers. Meta-analyses have borne out conflicting results on the mortality benefit. However analyses that exclude trials of short duration (i.e. < 2 years) have demonstrated a survival benefit and are generally considered more clinically relevant. A Cochrane systematic review in 2012 found no significant benefit in reducing mortality, the rate of liver transplantation, pruritus or fatigue. Ursodiol and obeticholic acid are FDA-approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. === Primary sclerosing cholangitis === UDCA use is associated with improved serum liver tests that do not always correlate with improved liver disease status. WHO Drug Information advises against its use in primary sclerosing cholangitis in unapproved doses beyond 13–15 mg/kg/day. UDCA in a dose of 28–30 mg/kg/day increases risk of death and need for liver transplant by 2.3-fold among those with primary sclerosing cholangitis, despite decrease in liver enzymes. === Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy === UDCA has been used for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. UDCA lessens itching in the mother and may reduce the number of preterm births. Effects on fetal distress and other adverse outcomes are unlikely to be great. === Cholestasis === UDCA use is not licensed in children, as its safety and effectiveness have not been established. Evidence is accumulating that ursodeoxycholic acid is ineffective, unsafe and its use is associated with significant risk of morbidity and mortality in neonatal hepatitis and neonatal cholestasis. === Other conditions === UDCA has been suggested to be an adequate treatment of bile reflux gastritis. In cystic fibrosis there is insufficient evidence to justify routine use of UDCA, especially as there is a lack of available data for long-term outcomes such as death or need for liver transplantation. UDCA has also been in effective in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in liver bile duct-paucity syndromes. It is contraindicated in obstruction of biliary tracts such as biliary atresia. It is not effective in liver allograft rejection, and in Graft-versus-host disease involving the liver. == Adverse effects == Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event seen in trial of UDCA in gallstone dissolution, occurring in 2 to 9%, which is less frequent than with chenodeoxycholic acid therapy. Bacterial conversion of UDCA to chenodeoxycholic acid may be the mechanism for this side effect. Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and exacerbation of pruritus was occasionally reported in trials in patients with PBC. Additional symptoms may include bloating, weight gain, and occasionally, thinning of hair. == Mechanisms of action == === Choleretic effects === Primary bile acids are produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. When secreted into the intestine, primary bile acids can be metabolized into secondary bile acids by intestinal bacteria. Primary and secondary bile acids help the body digest fats. Ursodeoxycholic acid helps regulate cholesterol by reducing the rate at which the intestine absorbs cholesterol molecules while breaking up micelles containing cholesterol. The drug reduces cholesterol absorption and is used to dissolve (cholesterol) gallstones in patients who want an alternative to surgery. There are multiple mechanisms involved in cholestatic liver diseases. === Immunomodulating effects === Ursodeoxycholic acid has also been shown experimentally to suppress immune response such as immune cell phagocytosis. Prolonged exposure and/or increased quantities of systemic (throughout the body, not just in the digestive system) ursodeoxycholic acid can be toxic. === Anti-inflammatory effects === Ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and protective effects in human epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been linked to regulation of immunoregulatory responses by regulation of cytokines, antimicrobial peptides defensins, and take an active part in increased restitution of wound in the colon. Moreover, UDCA's effects has been shown to have exert actions outside the epithelial cells. While some bile acids are known to be colon tumor promoters (e.g. deoxycholic acid), others such as ursodeoxycholic acid are thought to be chemopreventive, perhaps by inducing cellular differentiation and/or cellular senescence in colon epithelial cells. == Chemistry == Ursodeoxycholic acid is an epimer of chenodeoxycholic acid, which has similar choleretic effects and a wider species distribution. However, CDCA is not as well-tolerated in humans and it does not show immunomodulating or chemoprotective effects. Both are 7-hydroxyl derivatives of deoxycholic acid, but UDCA has the group in the beta instead of the alpha orientation. === Biosynthesis === Among mammals, only bears (Ursidae; excluding giant pandas) produce UDCA at useful amounts (>30%). It is produced in the bear liver, but the pathway remains unknown. Other vertebrates produce UDCA in much smaller amounts by gut bacteria. CDCA is oxidized into 7-oxo-CDCA then reduced into UDCA. === Industrial production === UDCA is most commonly produced from cholic acid (CA) derived from bovine bile, a by-product of the beef industry. The current yield of this semisynthesis is about 30%. == Society and culture == === Names === The term is from the Latin noun ursus meaning bear, as bear bile contains the substance. Ursodeoxycholic acid can be chemically synthesized and is marketed under multiple trade names, including Ursetor, Udikast, Actibile, Actigall, Biliver, Deursil, Egyurso, Heptiza 300/150, Stener, Udcasid, Udiliv, Udinorm, Udoxyl, Urso, Urso Forte, Ursocol, Ursoliv, Ursofalk, Ursosan, Ursoserinox, Udimarin, and Ursonova. === History === Bear bile, a natural source of UDCA, is used in traditional Chinese medicine since the seventh century. Japanese scientists successfully synthesized UDCA chemically in 1955. The earliest reference to UDCA in PubMed dates to 1957 under an alternative spelling ""ursodesoxycholic acid"", in a small-scale clinical trial. Ursodeoxycholic acid (application filed by Allergan) was approved for use in the United States in December 1987, and was designated an orphan drug. == References =="	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	{'MED': -0.00034976663, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -0.015540139, ' EN': -0.00039325762, 'DO': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': -9.0883464e-07}
438	1,3-diphenylguanidine	PUBMED	 Recent studies have demonstrated the widespread presence of 1,3-diphenylguanidine (DPG) and its derivatives in environmental matrices. While, the amount of human exposure to these rubber additives remains unclear. In this study, we collected human urine samples from healthy general adults (n = 221) living in Quzhou, China, and analyzed these samples for DPG and its five derivatives. DPG, 1,6-bis(cyano-guanidino)hexane (HCG), 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) and exhibited detection frequencies exceeding 50% in collected human urine. Presence of HCG, 1-(o-tolyl)biguanide (detection frequency 17%), and 1-(4-cyanophenyl)guanidine (6.0%) in human urine was also demonstrated for the first time. The highest mean human urinary concentration was found for DPG (0.89 ng/mL, < LOD-4.7 ng/mL), followed by DTG (0.57 ng/mL, < LOD-3.1 ng/mL) and HCG (0.34 ng/mL, < LOD-1.8 ng/mL). Male participants had consistently higher average human urinary levels of DPG, DTG, and HCG than female subjects, but none of these differences were significant (p > 0.10). DPG and DTQ consistently showed a decline in the human urinary concentrations as age of the participant increased. DPG (mean 170 ng/kg bw/day, median 137 ng/kg bw/day) had the highest human daily exposure amount, followed by DTG (106 ng/kg bw/day, 91 ng/kg bw/day) and HCG (58 ng/kg bw/day, 38 ng/kg bw/day). The study enhances our understanding of human exposure to these rubber additives, which is crucial for assessing their potential health risks. 1,3-Diphenylguanidine (DPG), benzothiazole (BTH), benzotriazole (BTR), and their derivatives are high-production-volume chemicals widely used in tires, corrosion inhibitors and plastic products. Vehicular traffic is an important source of these chemicals in the environment. Despite this, little is known about the occurrence of these chemicals in roadside soils. In this study, we determined the concentrations, profiles, and distribution patterns of 3 DPGs, 5 BTHs, and 7 BTRs in 110 soil samples collected from northeastern United States. We found widespread occurrence of 12 out of the 15 analytes measured in roadside soils, at detection frequencies ≥71 % and median concentrations in the range of 0.38-380 ng/g (dry weight). DPGs were the predominant chemicals accounting for 63 % of the sum concentrations of three chemical classes determined, followed by BTHs (28 %) and BTRs (9 %). The concentrations of all analytes (except for 1-, 4-, and 5-OH-BTRs) exhibited significant positive correlations (r: 0.1-0.9, p < 0.01), suggestive of their common sources and/or similar environmental fates. Higher concentrations of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs were found in soils from highways, rubberized playgrounds, and indoor parking lots than those from gardens, parks, and residential areas. Our findings suggest the release of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs from rubber products, especially automobile tires. Further studies are needed to investigate the environmental fate and toxicities of these chemicals to humans and wildlife. 1,3-Diphenylguanidine (DPG), 1,3-di-	INDUSTRIAL	INDUSTRIAL	{'IND': 0.0, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0}
446	Pimecrolimus	WIKIPEDIA	"Pimecrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug of the calcineurin inhibitor class used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema). It is available as a topical cream. It was developed and formerly marketed by Novartis under the trade name Elidel. == Medical uses == It has been proven to be effective in various inflammatory skin diseases, e.g., seborrheic dermatitis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, oral lichen planus, vitiligo, and psoriasis. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are both calcineurin inhibitors and function as immunosuppressants. === Atopic dermatitis === If topical corticosteroids and moisturisers fail in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, short-term treatment with topical calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may be tried. Both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are effective and safe to use in AD. == Side effects == In January 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Elidel packaging would be required to carry a black box warning regarding the potential increased risk of lymph node or skin cancer, as for the similar drug tacrolimus, whereas current practice by UK dermatologists is not to consider this a significant real concern and they are increasingly recommending the use of such new drugs. Importantly, although the FDA has approved updated black-box warning for tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, the recent report of the American Academy of Dermatology Association Task Force finds that there is no causal proof that topical immunomodulators cause lymphoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer, and systemic immunosuppression after short-term or intermittent long-term topical application seems an unlikely mechanism. Another recent review of evidence concluded that postmarketing surveillance shows no evidence for this systemic immunosuppression or increased risk for any malignancy. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health further concluded with moderate-certainty evidence that the two drugs were not associated with any increased risk of cancer. However, strong debates and controversies continue regarding the exact indications of immunomodulators and their duration of use in the absence of active controlled trials. Dermatologists' and allergists' professional societies, the American Academy of Dermatology, and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, have protested the inclusion of the black box warning. The AAAAI states ""None of the information provided for the cases of lymphoma associated with the use of topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus in AD indicate or suggest a causal relationship."" == Pharmacology == Pimecrolimus is an ascomycin macrolactam derivative. It has been shown in vitro that pimecrolimus binds to FKBP1A and also inhibits calcineurin. Thus pimecrolimus inhibits T-cell activation by inhibiting the synthesis and release of cytokines from T-cells. Pimecrolimus also prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells. Pimecrolimus, like tacrolimus, belongs to the ascomycin class of macrolactam immunosuppressives, acting by the inhibition of T-cell activation by the calcineurin pathway and inhibition of the release of numerous inflammatory cytokines, thereby preventing the cascade of immune and inflammatory signals. Pimecrolimus has a similar mode of action to that of tacrolimus but is more selective, with no effect on dendritic (Langerhans) cells. It has lower permeation through the skin than topical steroids or topical tacrolimus although they have not been compared with each other for their permeation ability through mucosa. In addition, in contrast with topical steroids, pimecrolimus does not produce skin atrophy. == Development and production == Pimecrolimus was developed by Novartis. Its development number was ascomycin derivative ASM 981. The New Drug Application (NDA) was filed December 15, 2000. It received US FDA approval on December 13, 2001. At its US approval, it was one of the first new eczema treatments introduced since the topical corticosteroids of the 1950s. It is available as a topical cream, once marketed by Novartis. Since early 2007, Galderma has been promoting the compound in Canada.

It is used for allergic conjunctivitis. As well as acting as an antihistamine, levocabastine has also subsequently been found to act as a potent and selective antagonist for the neurotensin receptor NTS2, and was the first drug used to characterise the different neurotensin subtypes. This has made it a useful tool for the study of this receptor. The pharmaceutical drug Bilina is a combination of Levocabastine, benzalkonium chloride, and other components and is typically used in a 0.5 mg/ml suspension as eye-drops, dispensed in 4ml bottles for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis or similar allergic ocular conditions.

452	Stercobilin	WIKIPEDIA	Stercobilin is a tetrapyrrolic bile pigment and is one end-product of heme catabolism. It is the chemical responsible for the brown color of human feces and was originally isolated from feces in 1932. Stercobilin (and related urobilin) can be used as a marker for biochemical identification of fecal pollution levels in rivers. == Metabolism == Stercobilin results from breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin found in erythrocytes (red blood cells). Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin, which rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Bilirubin binds tightly to plasma proteins (especially albumin) in the blood stream and is transported to the liver, where it is conjugated with one or two glucuronic acid residues into bilirubin diglucuronide, and secreted into the small intestine as bile. In the small intestine, some bilirubin glucuronide is converted back to bilirubin via bacterial enzymes in the terminal ileum. This bilirubin is further converted to colorless urobilinogen by the bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase. Urobilinogen that remains in the colon can either be reduced to stercobilinogen and finally oxidized to stercobilin, or it can be directly reduced to stercobilin. Stercobilin is responsible for the brown color of human feces. Stercobilin is then excreted in the feces. == Role in disease == === Obstructive jaundice === In obstructive jaundice, no bilirubin reaches the small intestine, meaning that there is no formation of stercobilinogen. The lack of stercobilin and other bile pigments causes feces to become clay-colored. === Brown pigment gallstones === An analysis of two infants suffering from cholelithiasis observed that a substantial amount of stercobilin was present in brown pigment gallstones. This study suggested that brown pigment gallstones could form spontaneously in infants suffering from bacterial infections of the biliary tract. == Role in treatment of disease == A 1996 study by McPhee et al. suggested that stercobilin and other related pyrrolic pigments — including urobilin, biliverdin, and xanthobilirubic acid — has potential to function as a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors when delivered at low micromolar concentrations. These pigments were selected due to a similarity in shape to the successful HIV-1 protease inhibitor Merck L-700,417 (N,N-bis(2-hydroxy-1-indanyl)-2,6-diphenylmethyl-4-hydroxy-1,7-heptandiamide). Further research is suggested to study the pharmacological efficacy of these pigments. == See also == Bile pigment Bilirubin Biliverdin Heme Urobilin == References ==	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': -3.1281633e-07, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
456	Cholestan-3-one	PUBMED	 We have investigated the effects of 5α-cholesten-3-one (5Ch3, 200 nM) on synaptic transmission in mouse diaphragm. 5Ch3 had no impact on the amplitude or frequency of miniature endplate currents (MEPCs, spontaneous secretion), but decreased the amplitude of EPCs (evoked secretion) triggered by single action potentials. Treatment with 5Ch3 increased the depression of EPC amplitude and slowed the unloading of the dye FM1-43 from synaptic vesicles (exocytosis rate) during high-frequency stimulation. The estimated recycling time of vesicles did not change, suggesting that the decline of synaptic efficiency was due to the reduction in the size of the population of vesicles involved in release. The effects of 5Ch3 on synaptic transmission may be related to changes in the phase properties of the membrane. We have found that 5Ch3 reduces the staining of synaptic regions with the B-subunit of cholera toxin (a marker of lipid rafts) and increases the fluorescence of 22-NBD-cholesterol, indicating a phase change within the membrane. Manipulations of membrane cholesterol (saturation or depletion) strongly reduced the influence of 5Ch3 on both FM1-43 dye unloading and staining with the B-subunit of cholera toxin. Thus, 5Ch3 reduces the number of vesicles which are actively recruited during synaptic transmission and alters membrane properties. These effects of 5Ch3 depend on membrane cholesterol. A facile novel strategy has been developed to obtain a key intermediate of squalamine, 7α, 24R -dihydroxy-5α-cholestan-3-one, starting from methyl Δ The 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of rat liver which catalyzes the conversion of 5alpha-cholestan-3-one to 5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol is localized mainly in the microsomal fraction. The enzyme required NADPH as hydrogen donor and differed from the known 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the C(19) series in being inactive in the presence of NADH. The microsomal preparations did not reduce the 3-keto groups of cholest-4-en-3-one, cholest-5-en-3-one, or 5beta-cholestan-3-one to the corresponding 3beta-hydroxy compounds. The conversion of 5alpha-cholestan-3-one to 5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol was only slightly inhibited by the reaction product or by other monohydroxy steroids, but a strong inhibitory effect was noted with cholest-5-en-3-one, 5alpha-cholestane-3beta, 7alpha-diol and 5alpha-cholestan-7-on-3beta-ol. The microsomes, but not high speed supernatant solution, catalyzed the reverse of the cholestanone reductase reaction, namely the conversion of 5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol to 5alpha-cholestan-3-one in the presence of oxygen and an NADP-generating system. The action of the microsomal preparations upon 5alpha-cholestan-3-one produced 5alpha-cholestan-3alpha-ol in addition to the 3beta-epimer. The 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase involved functioned with either NADH or NADPH as hydrogen donor.

460	7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-5alpha-cholan-24-oic acid	PUBMED	 Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

466	Avicholic acid	PUBMED	 Grounding on our former 3D QSAR studies, a knowledge-based screen of natural bile acids from diverse animal species has led to the identification of avicholic acid as a selective but weak TGR5 agonist. Chemical modifications of this compound resulted in the disclosure of 6α-ethyl-16-epi-avicholic acid that shows enhanced potency at TGR5 and FXR receptors. The synthesis, biological appraisals, and structure-activity relationships of this series of compounds are herein described. Moreover, a thorough physicochemical characterization of 6α-ethyl-16-epi-avicholic acid as compared to naturally occurring bile acids is reported and discussed. In the quest for new modulators of the Farnesoid-X (FXR) and Takeda G-protein-coupled (TGR5) receptors, bile acids are a popular candidate for drug development. Recently, bile acids endowed with a C16-hydroxy group emerged as ligands of FXR and TGR5 with remarkable agonistic efficacies. Inspired by these findings, we synthesised a series of C16-hydroxylated 12β-methyl-18- [reaction: see text] Avicholic acid, a major constituent of the bile of several avian species, was synthesized in eight steps from readily available chenodeoxycholic acid in 9% overall yield using Breslow's remote functionalization strategy in a key step. Micelle formation and equilibrium cholesterol solubilization properties were studied for avicholate in aqueous solution.	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.31793672, 'ICAL': 0.0}
469	Denatonium	WIKIPEDIA	Denatonium, usually available as denatonium benzoate (under trade names such as Denatrol, BITTERANT-b, BITTER+PLUS, Bitrex, Bitrix, and Aversion) and as denatonium saccharinate (BITTERANT-s), is the most bitter chemical compound known, with bitterness thresholds of 0.05 ppm for the benzoate and 0.01 ppm for the saccharinate. It was discovered in 1958 during research on local anesthetics by T. & H. Smith of Edinburgh, Scotland, and registered under the trademark Bitrex. Dilutions of as little as 10 ppm are unbearably bitter to most humans. Denatonium salts are usually colorless and odorless solids, but are often traded as solutions. They are used as aversive agents (bitterants) to prevent inappropriate ingestion. Denatonium is used in denatured alcohol, antifreeze, preventive nail biting preparations, respirator mask fit-testing, animal repellents, liquid soaps, shampoos, and Nintendo Switch game cards to prevent accidental swallowing or choking by children. It is not known to pose any long-term health risks. The name denatonium reflects the substance's primary use as a denaturant and its chemical nature as a cation, hence -onium as a Neo-Latin suffix. == Structure, synthesis, and physical properties == Denatonium is a quaternary ammonium cation. It is composed as a salt with any of several anions, such as benzoate or saccharinate. It can be obtained by the quaternization of lidocaine, a popular anesthetic, with benzyl chloride or a similar reagent. To obtain other salts, like the benzoate, the formed denatonium chloride is subjected to an anion exchange reaction with sodium benzoate, or first sodium hydroxide to make denatonium hydroxide followed by neutralization with benzoic acid. Other similar compounds are procaine and benzocaine. == Biochemistry == Denatonium in humans is recognized by eight distinct bitter taste receptors: TAS2R4, TAS2R8, TAS2R10, TAS2R39, TAS2R43, TAS2R16, TAS2R46, and TAS2R47, being by far the most sensitive to the compound. Denatonium can act as a bronchodilator by activating bitter taste receptors in the airway smooth muscle. == Applications == The bitterness of the compound guides most applications of denatonium. Denatonium benzoate is used to denature ethanol so that it is not treated as an alcoholic beverage with respect to taxation and sales restrictions. One designation in particular, SD-40B, indicates that ethanol has been denatured using denatonium benzoate. Denatonium is commonly included in placebos used in clinical trials to mimic the bitter taste of certain medications. Denatonium benzoate is an ingredient in certain nail polishes and varnishes designed to discourage nail biting, as the bitter denatonium serves as an aversive. Denatonium also discourages consumption of poisonous alcohols such as methanol and additives such as ethylene glycol. It is also added to many kinds of harmful liquids, including solvents (such as nail polish remover), paints, varnishes, toiletries and other personal care items, special nail polish for preventing nail biting, and various other household products. It is also added to less hazardous aerosol products (such as gas dusters) to discourage inhalant abuse of the volatile vapors. In 1995, the U.S. state of Oregon required that denatonium benzoate be added to products containing sweet-tasting ethylene glycol and methanol such as antifreeze and windshield washer fluid to prevent poisonings of children and animals. In December 2012, U.S. manufacturers voluntarily agreed to add denatonium benzoate to antifreeze sold nationwide. Animals are known to have different sensitivities to the effects of denatonium. It is used in some animal repellents (especially for such large mammals as deer). It has been used to safeguard rat poisons from human consumption, as humans are able to detect denatonium at much lower concentrations than rodents. Nintendo Switch game cartridges are coated in denatonium benzoate to prevent young children from consuming them. == See also == Amarogentin == References ==	INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE	{'IND': -0.004373629, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': -4.3202e-07, ',': -4.3226137e-05, ' PERSON': -0.0013509493, ' CARE': 0.0}
470	Monensin	WIKIPEDIA	Monensin is a polyether antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces cinnamonensis. It is widely used in ruminant animal feeds. The structure of monensin was first described by Agtarap et al. in 1967, and was the first polyether antibiotic to have its structure elucidated in this way. The first total synthesis of monensin was reported in 1979 by Kishi et al. == Mechanism of action == Monensin A is an ionophore related to the crown ethers with a preference to form complexes with monovalent cations such as: Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Ag+, and Tl+. Monensin A is able to transport these cations across lipid membranes of cells in an electroneutral (i.e. non-depolarizing) exchange, playing an important role as an Na+/H+ antiporter. Recent studies have shown that monensin may transport sodium ion through the membrane in both electrogenic and electroneutral manner. This approach explains ionophoric ability and in consequence antibacterial properties of not only parental monensin, but also its derivatives that do not possess carboxylic groups. It blocks intracellular protein transport, and exhibits antibiotic, antimalarial, and other biological activities. The antibacterial properties of monensin and its derivatives are a result of their ability to transport metal cations through cellular and subcellular membranes. == Uses == Monensin is used extensively in the beef and dairy industries to prevent coccidiosis, increase the production of propionic acid and prevent bloat. Furthermore, monensin, but also its derivatives monensin methyl ester (MME), and particularly monensin decyl ester (MDE) are widely used in ion-selective electrodes. In laboratory research, monensin is used extensively to block Golgi transport. == Toxicity == Monensin has some degree of activity on mammalian cells and thus toxicity is common. This is especially pronounced in horses, where monensin has a median lethal dose 1/100 that of ruminants. Accidental poisoning of equines with monensin is a well-documented occurrence which has resulted in deaths. == References ==	MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL	MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL	{'MED': -0.00040242894, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -5.955704e-05, ' IND': -0.00016742534, 'UST': -1.9361265e-07, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0}
474	Flutamide	WIKIPEDIA	"Flutamide, sold under the brand name Eulexin among others, is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) which is used primarily to treat prostate cancer. It is also used in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions like acne, excessive hair growth, and high androgen levels in women. It is taken by mouth, usually three times per day. Side effects in men include breast tenderness and enlargement, feminization, sexual dysfunction, and hot flashes. Conversely, the medication has fewer side effects and is better-tolerated in women with the most common side effect being dry skin. Diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes can occur in both sexes. Rarely, flutamide can cause liver damage, lung disease, sensitivity to light, elevated methemoglobin, elevated sulfhemoglobin, and deficient neutrophils. Numerous cases of liver failure and death have been reported, which has limited the use of flutamide. Flutamide acts as a selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), competing with androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to ARs in tissues like the prostate gland. By doing so, it prevents their effects and stops them from stimulating prostate cancer cells to grow. Flutamide is a prodrug to a more active form. Flutamide and its active form stay in the body for a relatively short time, which makes it necessary to take flutamide multiple times per day. Flutamide was first described in 1967 and was first introduced for medical use in 1983. It became available in the United States in 1989. The medication has largely been replaced by newer and improved NSAAs, namely bicalutamide and enzalutamide, due to their better efficacy, tolerability, safety, and dosing frequency (once per day), and is now relatively little-used. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Prostate cancer === GnRH is released by the hypothalamus in a pulsatile fashion; this causes the anterior pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH stimulates the testes to produce testosterone, which is metabolized to DHT by the enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT, and to a significantly smaller extent, testosterone, stimulate prostate cancer cells to grow. Therefore, blocking these androgens can provide powerful treatment for prostate cancer, especially metastatic disease. Normally administered are GnRH analogues, such as leuprorelin or cetrorelix. Although GnRH agonists stimulate the same receptors that GnRH does, since they are present continuously and not in a pulsatile manner, they serve to inhibit the pituitary gland and therefore block the whole chain. However, they initially cause a surge in activity; this is not solely a theoretical risk but may cause the cancer to flare. Flutamide was initially used at the beginning of GnRH agonist therapy to block this surge, and it and other NSAAs continue in this use. In contrast to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists don't cause an initial androgen surge, and are gradually replacing GnRH agonists in clinical use. There have been studies to investigate the benefit of adding an antiandrogen to surgical orchiectomy or its continued use with a GnRH analogue (combined androgen blockade (CAB)). Adding antiandrogens to orchiectomy showed no benefit, while a small benefit was shown with adding antiandrogens to GnRH analogues. Unfortunately, therapies which lower testosterone levels, such as orchiectomy or GnRH analogue administration, also have significant side effects. Compared to these therapies, treatment with antiandrogens exhibits ""fewer hot flashes, less of an effect on libido, less muscle wasting, fewer personality changes, and less bone loss."" However, antiandrogen therapy alone is less effective than surgery. Nevertheless, given the advanced age of many with prostate cancer, as well as other features, many men may choose antiandrogen therapy alone for a better quality of life. Flutamide has been found to be similarly effective in the treatment of prostate cancer to bicalutamide, although indications of inferior efficacy, including greater compensatory increases in testosterone levels and greater reductions in PSA levels with bicalutamide, were observed. The medication, at a dosage of 750 mg/day (250 mg three times daily), has also been found to be equivalent in effectiveness to 250 mg/day oral cyproterone acetate as a monotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer in a large-scale clinical trial of 310 patients, though its side effect and toxicity profiles (including gynecomastia, diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, and liver disturbances) were regarded as considerably worse than those of cyproterone acetate. A dosage of 750 mg/day flutamide (250 mg/three times a day) is roughly equivalent in terms of effectiveness to 50 mg/day bicalutamide when used as the antiandrogen component in combined androgen blockade in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Flutamide has been used to prevent the effects of the testosterone flare at the start of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. The combination of flutamide with an estrogen such as ethinylestradiol sulfonate has been used as a form of combined androgen blockade and as an alternative to the combination of flutamide with surgical or medical castration. === Skin and hair conditions === Flutamide has been researched and used extensively in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions in women including acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and scalp hair loss, as well as in hyperandrogenism (e.g., in polycystic ovary syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia), and is effective in improving the symptoms of these conditions. The dosages used are lower than those used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Although flutamide continues to be used for these indications, its use in recent years has been limited due to the risk of potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, and it is no longer recommended as a first- or second-line therapy. The related NSAA bicalutamide has also been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism in women and appears to have comparable effectiveness to that of flutamide, but has a far lower and only small risk of hepatotoxicity in comparison. Aside from its risk of liver toxicity and besides other nonsteroidal antiandrogens, it has been said that flutamide is likely the best typically used antiandrogen medication for the treatment of androgen-dependent symptoms in women. This is related to its high effectiveness and minimal side effects. ==== Acne and seborrhea ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of acne and seborrhea in women in a number of studies. In a long-term study of 230 women with acne, 211 of whom also had seborrhea, very-low-dose flutamide alone or in combination with an oral contraceptive caused a marked decrease in acne and seborrhea after 6 months of treatment, with maximal effect by 1 year of treatment and benefits maintained in the years thereafter. In the study, 97% of the women reported satisfaction with the control of their acne with flutamide. In another study, flutamide decreased acne and seborrhea scores by 80% in only 3 months. In contrast, spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same time period, suggesting superior effectiveness for flutamide for these indications. Flutamide has, in general, been found to reduce symptoms of acne by as much as 90% even at low doses, with several studies showing complete acne clearance. ==== Excessive hair growth ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism (excessive body/facial hair growth) in numerous studies. It possesses moderate effectiveness for this indication, and the overall quality of the evidence is considered to be moderate. The medication shows equivalent or superior effectiveness to other antiandrogens including spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, and finasteride in the treatment of hirsutism, although its relatively high risk of hepatotoxicity makes it unfavorable compared to these other options. It has been used to treat hirsutism at dosages ranging from 62.5 mg/day to 750 mg/day. A study found that multiple dosages of flutamide significantly reduced hirsutism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and that there were no significant differences in the effectiveness for dosages of 125 mg/day, 250 mg/day, and 375 mg/day. In addition, a study found that combination of 125 mg/day flutamide with finasteride was no more effective than 125 mg/day flutamide alone in the treatment of hirsutism. These findings support the use of flutamide at lower doses for hirsutism without loss of effectiveness, which may help to lower the risk of hepatotoxicity. However, the risk has been found to remain even at very low doses. ==== Scalp hair loss ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of female pattern hair loss in a number of studies. In one study of 101 pre- and postmenopausal women, flutamide alone or in combination with an oral contraceptive produced a marked decrease in hair loss scores after 1 year of treatment, with maximum effect after 2 years of treatment and benefits maintained for another 2 years. In a small study of flutamide with an oral contraceptive, the medication caused an increase in cosmetically acceptance hair density in 6 of 7 women with diffuse scalp hair loss. In a comparative study, flutamide significantly improved scalp hair growth (21% reduction in Ludwig scores) in hyperandrogenic women after 1 year of treatment, whereas cyproterone acetate and finasteride were ineffective. === Other uses === Flutamide has been used in case reports to decrease the frequency of spontaneous orgasms, for instance in men with post-orgasmic illness syndrome. === Available forms === Flutamide is available in the form of 125 mg oral capsules and 250 mg oral tablets. == Side effects == The side effects of flutamide are sex-dependent. In men, a variety of side effects related to androgen deprivation may occur, the most common being gynecomastia and breast tenderness. Others include hot flashes, decreased muscle mass, decreased bone mass and an associated increased risk of fractures, depression, and sexual dysfunction including reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. In women, flutamide is, generally, relatively well tolerated, and does not interfere with ovulation. The only common side effect of flutamide in women is dry skin (75%), which can be attributed to a reduction of androgen-mediated sebum production. General side effects that may occur in either sex include dizziness, lack of appetite, gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, a greenish-bluish discoloration of the urine, and hepatic changes. Because flutamide is a pure antiandrogen, unlike steroidal antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate and megestrol acetate (which additionally possess progestogenic activity), it does not appear to have a risk of cardiovascular side effects (e.g., thromboembolism) or fluid retention. === Gynecomastia === Flutamide, as a monotherapy, causes gynecomastia in 30 to 79% of men, and also produces breast tenderness. However, more than 90% of cases of gynecomastia with NSAAs including flutamide are mild to moderate. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with predominantly antiestrogenic actions, can counteract flutamide-induced gynecomastia and breast pain in men. === Diarrhea === Diarrhea is more common and sometimes more severe with flutamide than with other NSAAs. In a comparative trial of combined androgen blockade for prostate cancer, the rate of diarrhea was 26% for flutamide and 12% for bicalutamide. Moreover, 6% of flutamide-treated patients discontinued the medication due to diarrhea, whereas only 0.5% of bicalutamide-treated patients did so. In the case of antiandrogen monotherapy for prostate cancer, the rates of diarrhea are 5 to 20% for flutamide, 2 to 5% for bicalutamide, and 2 to 4% for nilutamide. In contrast to diarrhea, the rates of nausea and vomiting are similar among the three medications. === Rare reactions === ==== Liver toxicity ==== Although rare, flutamide has been associated with severe hepatotoxicity and death. By 1996, 46 cases of severe cholestatic hepatitis had been reported, with 20 fatalities. There have been continued case reports since, including liver transplants and death. A 2021 review of the literature found 15 cases of serious hepatotoxicity in women treated with flutamide, including 7 liver transplantations and 2 deaths. Based on the number of prescriptions written and the number of cases reported in the MedWatch database, the rate of serious hepatotoxicity associated with flutamide treatment was estimated in 1996 as approximately 0.03% (3 per 10,000). However, other research has suggested that the true incidence of significant hepatotoxicity with flutamide may be much greater, as high as 0.18 to 10%. Flutamide is also associated with liver enzyme elevations in up to 42 to 62% of patients, although marked elevations in liver enzymes (above 5 times upper normal limit) occur only in 3 to 5%. The risk of hepatotoxicity with flutamide is much higher than with nilutamide or bicalutamide. Lower doses of the medication appear to have a possibly reduced but still significant risk. Liver function should be monitored regularly with liver function tests during flutamide treatment. In addition, due to the high risk of serious hepatotoxicity, flutamide should not be used in the absence of a serious indication. The mechanism of action of flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity is thought to be due to mitochondrial toxicity. Specifically, flutamide and particularly its major metabolite hydroxyflutamide inhibit enzymes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain in hepatocytes, including respiratory complexes I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase), II (succinate dehydrogenase), and V (ATP synthase), and thereby reduce cellular respiration via ATP depletion and hence decrease cell survival. Inhibition of taurocholate (a bile acid) efflux has also been implicated in flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity. In contrast to flutamide and hydroxyflutamide, which severely compromise hepatocyte cellular respiration in vitro, bicalutamide does not significantly do so at the same concentrations and is regarded as non-mitotoxic. It is thought that the nitroaromatic group of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide enhance their mitochondrial toxicity; bicalutamide, in contrast, possesses a cyano group in place of the nitro moiety, greatly reducing the potential for such toxicity. The hepatotoxicity of flutamide appears to depend on hydrolysis of flutamide catalyzed by an arylacetamide deacetalyse enzyme. This is analogous to the hepatotoxicity that occurs with the withdrawn paracetamol (acetominophen)-related medication phenacetin. In accordance, the combination of paracetamol (acetaminophen) and flutamide appears to result in additive to synergistic hepatotoxicity, indicating a potential drug interaction. Hepatotoxicity with flutamide may be cross-reactive with that of cyproterone acetate. ==== Others ==== Flutamide has also been associated with interstitial pneumonitis (which can progress to pulmonary fibrosis). The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis with flutamide was found to be 0.04% (4 per 10,000) in a large clinical cohort of 41,700 prostate cancer patients. A variety of case reports have associated flutamide with photosensitivity. Flutamide has been associated with several case reports of methemoglobinemia. Bicalutamide does not appear to share this risk with flutamide. Flutamide has also been associated with reports of sulfhemoglobinemia and neutropenia. === Birth defects === Out of the available endocrine-disrupting compounds looked at, flutamide has a notable effect on anogenital distance in rats.) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Flutamide acts as a selective, competitive, silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). Its active form, hydroxyflutamide, has between 10- and 25-fold higher affinity for the AR than does flutamide, and hence is a much more potent AR antagonist in comparison. However, at high concentrations, unlike flutamide, hydroxyflutamide is able to weakly activate the AR. Flutamide has far lower affinity for the AR than do steroidal antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, and it is a relatively weak antiandrogen in terms of potency by weight, but the large dosages at which flutamide is used appear to compensate for this. In accordance with its selectivity for the AR, flutamide does not interact with the progesterone, estrogen, glucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid receptor, and possesses no intrinsic progestogenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antigonadotropic activity. However, it can have some indirect estrogenic effects via increased levels of estradiol secondary to AR blockade, and this involved in the gynecomastia it can produce. Because flutamide does not have any estrogenic, progestogenic, or antigonadotropic activity, the medication does not cause menstrual irregularities in women. This is in contrast to steroidal antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate. Similarly to nilutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide, flutamide crosses the blood–brain barrier and exerts central antiandrogen actions. Flutamide has been found to be equal to slightly more potent than cyproterone acetate and substantially more potent than spironolactone as an antiandrogen in bioassays. This is in spite of the fact that hydroxyflutamide has on the order of 10-fold lower affinity for the AR relative to cyproterone acetate. Hydroxyflutamide shows about 2- to 4-fold lower affinity for the rat and human AR than does bicalutamide. In addition, whereas bicalutamide has an elimination half-life of around 6 days, hydroxyflutamide has an elimination half-life of only 8 to 10 hours, a roughly 17-fold difference. In accordance, at dosages of 50 mg/day bicalutamide and 750 mg/day flutamide (a 15-fold difference), circulating levels of flutamide at steady-state have been found to be approximately 7.5-fold lower than those of bicalutamide. Moreover, whereas flutamide at this dosage has been found to produce a 75% reduction in prostate-specific antigen levels in men with prostate cancer, a fall of 90% has been demonstrated with this dosage of bicalutamide. In accordance, 50 mg/day bicalutamide has been found to possess equivalent or superior effectiveness to 750 mg/day flutamide in a large clinical trial for prostate cancer. Also, bicalutamide has been shown to be 5-fold more potent than flutamide in rats and 50-fold more potent than flutamide in dogs. Taken together, flutamide appears to be a considerably less potent and efficacious antiandrogen than is bicalutamide. Dose-ranging studies of flutamide in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer alone and in combination with a GnRH agonist have been performed. Flutamide increases testosterone levels by 5- to 10-fold in gonadally intact male rats. ==== CYP17A1 inhibition ==== Flutamide and hydroxyflutamide have been found in vitro to inhibit CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), an enzyme which is required for the biosynthesis of androgens. In accordance, flutamide has been found to slightly but significantly lower androgen levels in GnRH analogue-treated male prostate cancer patients and women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In a directly comparative study of flutamide monotherapy (375 mg once daily) versus bicalutamide monotherapy (80 mg once daily) in Japanese men with prostate cancer, after 24 weeks of treatment flutamide decreased dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels by about 44% while bicalutamide increased them by about 4%. As such, flutamide is a weak inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis. However, the clinical significance of this action may be limited when flutamide is given without a GnRH analogue to non-castrated men, as the medication markedly elevates testosterone levels into the high normal male range via prevention of AR activation-mediated negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis in this context. ==== Other activities ==== Flutamide has been identified as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This may be involved in the hepatotoxicity of flutamide. === Pharmacokinetics === The absorption of flutamide is complete upon oral ingestion. Food has no effect on the bioavailability of flutamide. Steady-state levels of hydroxyflutamide, the active form of flutamide, are achieved after 2 to 4 days administration. Levels of hydroxyflutamide are approximately 50-fold higher than those of flutamide at steady-state. The plasma protein binding of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide are high; 94 to 96% and 92 to 94%, respectively. Flutamide and its metabolite hydroxyflutamide are known to be transported by the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1; ABCC1). Flutamide is metabolized by CYP1A2 (via α-hydroxylation) in the liver during first-pass metabolism to its main metabolite hydroxyflutamide (which accounts for 23% of an oral dose of flutamide one hour post-ingestion), and to at least five other, minor metabolites. Flutamide has at least 10 inactive metabolites total, including 4-nitro-3-fluoro-methylaniline. Flutamide is excreted in various forms in the urine, the primary form being 2-amino-5-nitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol. Flutamide and hydroxyflutamide have elimination half-lives of 4.7 hours and 6 hours in adults, respectively. However, the half-life of hydroxyflutamide is extended to 8 hours after a single dose and to 9.6 hours at steady state) in elderly individuals. The elimination half-lives of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide are regarded as too short to allow for once-daily dosing, and for this reason, flutamide is instead administered three times daily at 8-hour intervals. In contrast, the newer NSAAs nilutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide all have much longer half-lives, and this allows for once-daily administration in their cases. == Chemistry == Unlike the hormones with which it competes, flutamide is not a steroid; rather, it is a substituted anilide. Hence, it is described as nonsteroidal in order to distinguish it from older steroidal antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and megestrol acetate. === Synthesis === Schotten–Baumann reaction between 4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline [393-11-3] (1) with isobutanoyl chloride [79-30-1] (2) in the presence of triethylamine. == History == Flutamide was first synthesized in 1967 by Neri and colleagues at Schering Plough Corporation. It was originally synthesized as a bacteriostatic agent, but was subsequently, and serendipitously found to possess antiandrogen activity. The code name of flutamide during development was SCH-13521. Clinical research of the medication began in 1971, and it was first marketed in 1983, specifically in Chile under the brand name Drogenil and in West Germany under the brand name Flugerel. Flutamide was not introduced in the United States until 1989; it was specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. The medication was first studied for the treatment of hirsutism in women in 1989. It was the first ""pure antiandrogen"" to be studied in the treatment of hirsutism. Flutamide was the first NSAA to be introduced, and was followed by nilutamide in 1989 and then bicalutamide in 1995. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Flutamide is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its names in Latin, German, and Spanish are flutamidum, flutamid, and flutamida, respectively. The medication has also been referred to by the name niftolide. === Brand names === Brand names of flutamide include or have included Cebatrol, Cytomid, Drogenil, Etaconil, Eulexin, Flucinom, Flumid, Flutacan, Flutamid, Flutamida, Flutamin, Flutan, Flutaplex, Flutasin, Fugerel, Profamid, and Sebatrol, among others. === Availability === Flutamide is marketed widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Central and South America, East and Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East. == Research == === Prostate cancer === The combination of an estrogen and flutamide as a form of combined androgen blockade for the treatment of prostate cancer has been researched. === Enlarged prostate === Flutamide has been studied in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; enlarged prostate) in men in several clinical studies. It has been found to reduce prostate volume by about 25%, which is comparable to the reduction achieved with the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride. Unfortunately, it has been associated with side effects in these studies including gynecomastia and breast tenderness (in about 50% of patients), gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, diarrhea, and flatulence, and hepatotoxicity, although sexual function including libido and erectile potency were maintained. === Breast cancer === Flutamide was studied for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in two phase II clinical trials but was found to be ineffective. Out of a total of 47 patients, only three short-term responses occurred. However, the patients in the studies were selected irrespective of AR, ERTooltip estrogen receptor, PRTooltip progesterone receptor, or HER2 status, which were all unknown. === Psychiatric disorders === Flutamide has been studied in the treatment of bulimia nervosa in women. Flutamide was found to be effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in men with comorbid Tourette's syndrome in one small randomized controlled trial. Conversely, it was ineffective in patients with OCD in another study. More research is necessary to determine whether flutamide is effective in the treatment of OCD. == References == == Further reading =="	MEDICAL	MEDICAL	{'MED': -4.3202e-07, 'ICAL': 0.0}

488	B10a30 faulkner legacy library looks like sterol or lipid needs to be verified	PUBMED	 Current treatment goals for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) recommended by the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) are LDL-C ≤2.5 mmol/L (∼100 mg/dL) or ≤1.8 mmol/L (∼70 mg/dL) in very high-risk subjects. The objective of the present study was to investigate characteristics and treatment status in subjects with genetically verified FH followed at specialized lipid clinics in Norway. Data from treatment registries of 714 adult (>18 years) subjects with FH. Fifty-seven percent were female. Mean age (SD) at last visit was 44 (16.3) years, and the subjects had been followed at a lipid clinic for 11.1 (7.9) years. Two hundred forty-five (34%) were classified as very-high-risk, and 44% of these had established coronary heart disease. Very-high-risk FH subjects more often received maximal statin dose (54% vs 33%, P < .001), ezetimibe (76% vs 48%, P < .001) or resins (23% vs 9%, P < .001), and achieved LDL-C was lower (3.2 vs 3.5 mmol/L [124 vs 135 mg/dL], P = .003) than normal-risk FH. LDL-C treatment goal was achieved in 25% and 8% of subjects with normal-risk and very-high-risk FH, respectively. Lp(a) levels were available in 599 subjects, and they were divided into 2 groups: ≥90 mg/dL (n = 96) and <90 mg/dL (n = 503). Despite similar lipid levels, body mass index, smoking status, presence of diabetes, and blood pressure, prevalence of coronary heart disease was doubled in the high- compared to low-Lp(a) group (30% vs 14%, P < .001). Very few FH subjects achieve their LDL-C treatment goal. New treatment modalities are needed. Independent of LDL-C and other risk factors, high Lp(a) seem to be an important additional risk factor in genetically verified FH. Platelets are critical for haemostasis and blood clotting. However, since under normal circumstances blood should flow without clotting, its function is regulated via a complex interplay of activating and inhibiting signal transduction pathways. Understanding this network is crucial for treatment of cardiovascular and bleeding diseases. Detailed protein interaction and phosphorylation data are explored to establish a simplified Boolean model of the central platelet cascades. We implemented the model by means of CellNetAnalyzer and showed how different signalling events coalesce into a fully activated system state. Furthermore, we examined the networks' inherent threshold behaviour using the semi-quantitative modelling software SQUAD. Finally, predictions are verified monitoring phosphorylations which mark different activation phases as modelled. The model can also be applied to simulate different pharmacological conditions as they modify node activity (aspirin, clopidogrel, milrinon, iloprost, combination) and is available for further studies. It agrees well with observations. Activatory pathways are diversified to cope with complex environmental conditions. Platelet activation needs several activation steps to integrate over different network subsets, as they are formed by the interplay of activating kinases, calcium mobilization, and the inhibiting cAMP-PKA system. System stability analysis shows two phases: a sub-threshold behaviour, characterized by integration over different activatory and inhibitory conditions, and a beyond threshold phase, represented by competition and shutting down of counter-regulatory pathways. The integrin network and Akt-protein are critical for stable effector response. Dynamic threshold-analysis reveals a dependency of the relative activating input strength necessary to irreversibly engage the system from the absolute inhibitory signal strength. Dynamic 1-(11)C-acetate PET (AC-PET) allows quantification of myocardial blood flow and oxidative metabolism. We wanted to determine the accuracy of AC-PET in measuring cardiac output (CO) using first-pass analysis and the indicator dilution principle. Further, we wanted to investigate the pulmonary uptake of acetate in relation to left atrial filling pressures and ventricular function. Twenty-four steady-state experiments were performed in 5 domestic pigs. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and CO by thermodilution (CO(thermo)) were recorded invasively simultaneous with AC-PET scans at baseline (n = 9), dobutamine infusion (n = 6), high-dose metoprolol and morphine (n = 6), and angiotensinamide infusion (n = 3). 1-(11)C-Acetate was injected as a rapid manual bolus. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the right (RV) and left (LV) heart cavities. Time-activity curves were constructed and the area under the curve (AUC) was integrated from beginning the scan to the time of visually determined recirculation by simple arithmetic. CO by PET (CO(PET)) was calculated as injected dose/AUC. Image handling and curve analysis were repeated by a blinded observer. Total pulmonary extravascular retention of (11)C, expressed as percentage of injected dose (lung-uptake %ID), was measured using a combination of transmission, (15)O-carbon monoxide, and AC-PET scans. CO(thermo) ranged from 2.1 to 8.2 L/min. CO(PET) determined from both LV and RV was linearly related to CO(thermo) with slopes close to 1 (LV, r = 0.98; RV, r = 0.96; both P < 0.001). Interobserver reproducibility was r = 0.98, P < 0.001. The PCWP range was 6-14 mm Hg and the lung-uptake %ID was 2.7-8.5 %ID. When normalized to baseline, lung-uptake %ID was correlated with PCWP (r = 0.56, P = 0.01) and linearly correlated with LV input resistance (PCWP divided by CO(thermo); r = 0.91, P < 0.001). When both lung-uptake %ID and stroke volume were normalized to baseline, a piecewise linear relation was found (r = 0.95, P < 0.001). Our results suggest that measurements of CO by AC-PET are feasible and accurate. Using RV ROIs might favor CO measurements by any injectable PET tracer. The lung-uptake %ID might be useful in evaluation of pulmonary congestion, but further studies are needed.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -3.1281633e-07}
491	Diosgenin	WIKIPEDIA	Diosgenin, a phytosteroid sapogenin, is the product of hydrolysis by acids, strong bases, or enzymes of saponins, extracted from the tubers of Dioscorea wild yam species, such as the Kokoro. It is also present in smaller amounts in a number of other species. The sugar-free (aglycone) product of such hydrolysis, diosgenin is used for the commercial synthesis of cortisone, pregnenolone, progesterone, and other steroid products. == Sources == It is present in detectable amounts in Costus speciosus, Smilax menispermoidea, Helicteres isora, species of Paris, Aletris, Trigonella, and Trillium, and in extractable amounts from many species of Dioscorea – D. althaeoides, D. colletti, D. composita, D. floribunda, D. futschauensis, D. gracillima, D. hispida, D. hypoglauca, D. mexicana, D. nipponica, D. panthaica, D. parviflora, D. septemloba, and D. zingiberensis. == Industrial uses == Diosgenin is a chemical precursor for several hormones, starting with the Marker degradation process, which includes synthesis of progesterone. The process was used in the early manufacturing of combined oral contraceptive pills. Diosgenin in dietary supplements is not a physiological precursor to estradiol or progesterone, and the use of such products as wild yam has no hormonal activity in the human body. == See also == List of neurosteroids Spirostanes == References == == External links == Diosgenin at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL	{'MED': -0.0031259058, 'ICAL': -5.5122365e-07, ',': -9.0883464e-07, ' IND': -0.3639775, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': 0.0, 'AL': 0.0}
496	7-ketocholesterol	PUBMED	 7-Ketocholesterol is a major oxidation product of cholesterol found in human atherosclerotic plaque and is more atherogenic than cholesterol in some animal studies. 7-Ketocholesterol can inhibit cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis, as well as strongly inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. It has even been suggested that 7-ketocholesterol is formed enzymically as an endogenous regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis. However, when tested as a pharmacological cholesterol-lowering agent, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase was rapidly overcome and the 7-ketocholesterol metabolised. In vitro, 7-ketocholesterol has wide-ranging and potent effects, most of which have the potential to contribute to atherosclerosis. For example, 7-ketocholesterol can be cytotoxic and can induce apoptosis in vascular cells. These effects, either individually or more likely, in combination, all implicate 7-ketocholesterol in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis, but further work is needed to establish whether or not its role is a direct causal one. 7-Ketocholesterol (7KC) is a toxic oxysterol that is associated with many diseases and disabilities of aging, as well as several orphan diseases. 7KC is the most common product of a reaction between cholesterol and oxygen radicals and is the most concentrated oxysterol found in the blood and arterial plaques of coronary artery disease patients as well as various other disease tissues and cell types. Unlike cholesterol, 7KC consistently shows cytotoxicity to cells and its physiological function in humans or other complex organisms is unknown. Oxysterols, particularly 7KC, have also been shown to diffuse through membranes where they affect receptor and enzymatic function. Here, we will explore the known and proposed mechanisms of pathologies that are associated with 7KC, as well speculate about the future of 7KC as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in medicine. 7-Ketocholesterol, which is one of the earliest cholesterol oxidization products identified, is essentially formed by the auto-oxidation of cholesterol. In the body, 7-ketocholesterol is both provided by food and produced endogenously. This pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory molecule, which can activate apoptosis and autophagy at high concentrations, is an abundant component of oxidized Low Density Lipoproteins. 7-Ketocholesterol appears to significantly contribute to the development of age-related diseases (cardiovascular diseases, age-related macular degeneration, and Alzheimer's disease), chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and to certain cancers. Recent studies have also shown that 7-ketocholesterol has anti-viral activities, including on SARS-CoV-2, which are, however, lower than those of oxysterols resulting from the oxidation of cholesterol on the side chain. Furthermore, 7-ketocholesterol is increased in the serum of moderately and severely affected COVID-19 patients. In the case of COVID-19, it can be assumed that the antiviral activity of 7-ketocholesterol could be counterbalanced by its toxic effects, including pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant activities that might promote the induction of cell death in alveolar cells. It is therefore suggested that this oxysterol might be involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 by contributing to the acute respiratory distress syndrome and promoting a deleterious, even fatal outcome. Thus, 7-ketocholesterol could possibly constitute a lipid biomarker of COVID-19 outcome and counteracting its toxic effects with adjuvant therapies might have beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients.

500	Hexadecanamide	PUBMED	 Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) has been demonstrated to promote the development of mastitis, one of the most serious diseases in dairy farming worldwide, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Using untargeted metabolomics, we found hexadecanamide (HEX) was significantly reduced in rumen fluid and milk from cows with SARA-associated mastitis. Herein, we aimed to assess the protective role of HEX in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)- and SARA-induced mastitis and the underlying mechanism. We showed that HEX ameliorated S. aureus-induced mastitis in mice, which was related to the suppression of mammary inflammatory responses and repair of the blood-milk barrier. In vitro, HEX depressed S. aureus-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway and improved barrier integrity in mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs). In detail, HEX activated PPARα, which upregulated SIRT1 and subsequently inhibited NF-κB activation and inflammatory responses. In addition, ruminal microbiota transplantation from SARA cows (S-RMT) caused mastitis and aggravated S. aureus-induced mastitis, while these changes were reversed by HEX. Our findings indicate that HEX effectively attenuates S. aureus- and SARA-induced mastitis by limiting inflammation and repairing barrier integrity, ultimately highlighting the important role of host or microbiota metabolism in the pathogenesis of mastitis and providing a potential strategy for mastitis prevention. Asthenozoospermia (AZS) is a prevalent contributor to male infertility, characterized by a substantial decline in sperm motility. In recent years, large-scale studies have explored the interplay between the male reproductive system's microecology and its implications for reproductive health. Nevertheless, the direct association between seminal microecology and male infertility pathogenesis remains inconclusive. This study used 16S rDNA sequencing and multi-omics analysis to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the seminal microbial community and metabolites in AZS patients. Patients were categorized into four distinct groups: Normal, mild AZS (AZS-I), moderate AZS (AZS-II), and severe AZS (AZS-III). Microbiome differential abundance analysis revealed significant differences in microbial composition and metabolite profiles within the seminal plasma of these groups. Subsequently, patients were classified into a control group (Normal and AZS-I) and an AZS group (AZS-II and AZS-III). Correlation and cross-reference analyses identified distinct microbial genera and metabolites.

501	Erucamide	PUBMED	" Marine biofouling of ship hulls and ocean structures causes enormous economic losses due to increased frictional drag. Thus, efforts have been exerted worldwide to eliminate biofouling. In addition, a strong demand exists for the development of a cost-effective and eco-friendly anti-biofouling coating technology. Thus, erucamide-polydimethylsiloxane (EP) coating is proposed in this study. EP exhibits a hydrophobic surface as the erucamide content and drag reduction effect increase. In this study, the drag reduction effect of the EP 2.5 is better than that of glass and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces. Moreover, the proposed EP coatings are observed to prevent the biofouling induced by bacteria (E. coli) and brown algae (Cladosiphon sp.). In addition, through a marine field test, the anti-biofouling effect of the EP surface is found to be better than the previously studied oleamide-PDMS (OP) surface. In the marine field test, the EP 2.5 demonstrates superior anti-biofouling performance for 5.5 months under real marine environment. The proposed eco-friendly EP coating method could be applicable to marine vehicles that require effective drag reduction and anti-biofouling properties. Erucamide is known to play a critical role in modifying polymer fiber surface chemistry and morphology. However, its effects on fiber crystallinity and mechanical properties remain to be understood. Here, synchrotron nanofocused X-ray Diffraction (nXRD) revealed a bimodal orientation of the constituent polymer chains aligned along the fiber axis and cross-section, respectively. Erucamide promoted crystallinity in the fiber, leading to larger and more numerous lamellae crystallites. The nXRD nanostructual characterization is complemented by single-fiber uniaxial tensile tests, which showed that erucamide significantly affected fiber mechanical properties, decreasing fiber tensile strength and stiffness but enhancing fiber toughness, fracture strain, and ductility. To correlate these single-fiber nXRD and mechanical test results, we propose that erucamide mediated slip at the interfaces between crystallites and amorphous domains during stress-induced single-fiber crystallization, also decreasing the stress arising from the shear displacement of microfibrils and deformation of the macromolecular network. Linking the single-fiber crystal structure with the single-fiber mechanical properties, these findings provide the direct evidence on a single-fiber level for the role of erucamide in enhancing fiber ""softness"". Postpartum depression has a crucial impact on the physical and psychological comfort and the work of postnatal women, the growth and development of infants and mental health in adulthood. Finding a safe and effective anti-postnatal depression drug is currently an important research goal in this field. In this study, the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were used to evaluated the depressive behaviors of mice, and the changes of metabolites and intestinal microflora in mice with postpartum depression were examined through non-target metabolomics and 16S RNA sequencing respectively. We found that traditional Chinese medicine compound 919 Syrup could alleviate postpartum depression in mice and inhibit the elevated erucamide level in depressive hippocampus. However, mice treated with antibiotics were not sensitive to the anti-postnatal depression effect of 919 Syrup, and the level of 5-aminovaleric acid betaine (5-AVAB) in their hippocampus was significantly decreased. Transplanting fecal microflora treated with 919 Syrup could effectively improve the depressive behaviors of mice, upregulate the level of gut-derived 5-AVAB in the hippocampus, and downregulate the level of erucamide. Erucamide was significantly negatively correlated with increased Bacteroides in intestine after 919 Syrup treatment or fecal transplantation, and significantly positively correlated with Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 which was increased in feces of mice with postpartum depression. The increase of Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and Ruminiclostridium in intestine after fecal transplantation had a clearly positive correlation with 5-AVAB. In brief, 919 Syrup may downregulate the ratio of hippocampal metabolites erucamide to 5-AVAB by regulating intestinal flora to alleviate postpartum depression, laying a scientific foundation for future pathological research and development of therapeutic drugs for postpartum depression."

514	Icaridin	WIKIPEDIA	"Icaridin, also known as picaridin, is an insect repellent which can be used directly on skin or clothing. It has broad efficacy against various arthropods such as mosquitos, ticks, gnats, flies and fleas, and is almost colorless and odorless. A study performed in 2010 showed that picaridin spray and cream at the 20% concentration provided 12 hours of protection against ticks. Unlike DEET, icaridin does not dissolve plastics, synthetics or sealants, is odorless and non-greasy and presents a lower risk of toxicity when used with sunscreen, as it may reduce skin absorption of both compounds. The name picaridin was proposed as an International Nonproprietary Name (INN) to the World Health Organization (WHO), but the official name that has been approved by the WHO is icaridin. The chemical is part of the piperidine family, along with many pharmaceuticals and alkaloids such as piperine, which gives black pepper its spicy taste. Trade names include Bayrepel and Saltidin among others. The compound was developed by the German chemical company Bayer in the 1980s and was given the name Bayrepel. In 2005, Lanxess AG and its subsidiary Saltigo GmbH were spun off from Bayer and the product was renamed Saltidin in 2008. Having been sold in Europe (where it is the best-selling insect repellent) since 1998, on 23 July 2020, icaridin was approved again by the EU Commission for use in repellent products. The approval entered into force on 1 February 2022 and is valid for ten years. == Effectiveness == Icaridin and DEET are the most effective insect repellents available. A 2018 systematic review found no consistent performance difference between icaridin and DEET in field studies and concluded that they are equally preferred mosquito repellents, noting that 50% DEET offers longer protection but is not available in some countries. Icaridin has been reported to be as effective as DEET at a 20% concentration without the irritation associated with DEET. According to the WHO, icaridin “demonstrates excellent repellent properties comparable to, and often superior to, those of the standard DEET.” Icaridin-based products have been evaluated by Consumer Reports in 2016 as among the most effective insect repellents when used at a 20% concentration. Icaridin was earlier reported to be effective by Consumer Reports (7% solution) and the Australian Army (20% solution). Consumer Reports retests in 2006 gave as result that a 7% solution of icaridin offered little or no protection against Aedes mosquitoes (vector of dengue fever) and a protection time of about 2.5 hours against Culex (vector of West Nile virus), while a 15% solution was good for about one hour against Aedes and 4.8 hours against Culex. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using repellents based on icaridin, DEET, ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (containing p-menthane-3,8-diol, PMD) for effective protection against mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis and other illnesses. == Adverse effects == Icaridin can cause mild to moderate eye irritation on contact and is slightly toxic if ingested. == Environmental impact == A 2018 study found that a commercial repellent product containing 20% icaridin, in what the authors described as ""conservative exposure doses"", is highly toxic to larval salamanders, a major predator of mosquito larvae. The study observed high larval salamander mortality occurring delayed after the four days of exposure. Because the widely used LC50 test for assessing a chemical's environmental toxicity is based on mortality within four days, the authors suggested that icaridin would be incorrectly deemed as ""safe"" under the test protocol. However, icaridin was also non-toxic in a 21-day reproduction test on the water flea Daphnia magna and a 32-day early life-stage test in zebrafish. Since only the icaridin content of the tested repellent product is known, the observed effects cannot be readily attributed to icaridin. Furthermore, the effects of the repellent product showed no dose-response relationship, i.e., there was neither an increase of the magnitude or severity of the observed effects (mortality, tail deformation), nor did the effects occur at earlier time points. The study has been regarded as invalid by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, which has evaluated icaridin prior to its approval under the EU Biocidal Product Regulation. The reasons for rejection were the testing of a mixture of undisclosed composition, the use of a non-standard test organism, the lack of analytical verification of actual test concentrations, and the fact that the test solution was never renewed with the 25 days of study duration. == Mechanism of action == In 2014, a potential odorant receptor for icaridin (and DEET), CquiOR136•CquiOrco, was suggested for Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito. Recent crystal and solution studies showed that icaridin binds to Anopheles gambiae odorant binding protein 1 (AgamOBP1). The crystal structure of AgamOBP1•icaridin complex (PDB: 5EL2) revealed that icaridin binds to the DEET-binding site in two distinct orientations and also to a second binding site (sIC-binding site) located at the C-terminal region of the AgamOBP1. Research on Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes suggests icaridin does not strongly activate their olfactory receptor neurons, but instead reduces the volatility of the odorants with which it is mixed. By reducing their volatility, icaridin effectively ""masks"" odorants attractive to mosquitoes on the skin, preventing them from reaching the olfactory receptors to some extent. == Chemistry == Icaridin contains two stereocenters: one where the hydroxyethyl chain attaches to the ring, and one where the sec-butyl attaches to the oxygen of the carbamate. The commercial material contains a mixture of all four stereoisomers. == Commercial products == Commercial products containing icaridin include Cutter Advanced, Muskol, Repeltec, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus, Sawyer Picaridin Insect Repellent, Off! FamilyCare, Autan, Smidge, PiActive and MOK.O. == See also == DEET Ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535) Permethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide that can be applied to clothing to help prevent bites p-Menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) SS220, another substituted-piperidine insect repellent == References == == External links == Picaridin General Fact Sheet - National Pesticide Information Center Choosing and Using Insect Repellents - National Pesticide Information Center EPA fact sheet"	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	PERSONAL CARE	{'PERSON': -0.0023229604, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}
521	7,8,4'-trihydroxyflavone	PUBMED	 Tyrosinase is a ubiquitous enzyme that plays an essential role in the production of melanin. Effective inhibitors of tyrosinase have extensive applications in the medical, cosmetic and food industries. In this study, a combination of enzyme kinetics, ultraviolet (UV)-visible absorption, fluorescence spectroscopic techniques and a computational simulation method was used to characterize the inhibitory mechanism of 7,8,4´-trihydroxyflavone on tyrosinase. 7,8,4´-Trihydroxyflavone was found to strongly inhibit the oxidation of l-DOPA by tyrosinase with an IC 8-Hydroxyflavone is not found in nature. While the (13)C chemical shifts of 8-hydroxyflavone have been reported previously, the observed (13)C chemical shifts were not assigned. A previously reported empirical predictive tool has been applied in reverse in order to deconvolute the (13)C chemical shifts for 8-hydroxyflavone from each of those of 7,8,4'-trihydroxyflavone and 7,8-dihydroxyflavone together with those of 7-hydroxyflavone, 4'-hydroxyflavone, and flavone. The two sets of calculated (13)C chemical shifts for 8-hydroxyflavone are in good agreement with each other in that the average absolute difference is 0.4 ppm. The previously reported but unassigned (13)C chemical shifts for 8-hydroxyflavone have been assigned by matching them with the averages of the two sets of calculated (13)C chemical shifts for 8-hydroxyflavone such that the minimum average absolute difference is 0.63 ppm. The assigned (13)C chemical shifts of 8-hydroxyflavone may be used, along with the (13)C chemical shifts of the remaining monohydroxyflavones, as part of a predictive tool to rapidly assess the (13)C NMR spectra of C8-hydroxylated flavonoids.

527	Diphenylacetic acid	PUBMED	 1. Biliary elimination in female Wistar albino rats 3 h after i.p. injection of [3H]phenolphthalein, [3H]morphine, 14C-LSD and [14C]diphenylacetic acid was 90%, 45%, 75% and 57% respectively, predominantly as glucuronides. 2. Infusion of 3 h bile from the previous experiments into the duodena of bile-duct-cannulated animals demonstrated enterohepatic circulation, amounting in 24 h to 85%, 41%, 28% and 66% of the infused doses of the conjugates of phenolphthalein, morphine, LSD and diphenylacetic acid respectively. 3. Pretreatment with antibiotics to suppress intestinal microflora decreased this enterohepatic recirculation to 22%, 8.6% and 21% in 24 h for phenolphthalein, morphine and diphenylacetic acid glucuronides respectively. Antibiotic pretreatment did not influence the absorption and re-excretion of infused doses of the free aglycones, thus demonstrating the importance of bacterial beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis of the biliary conjugates. 4. The extent of intestinal absorption of the aglycones after bacterial beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis of the conjugates is related to their lipid-solubility as estimated by octan-1-ol:0.1 M phosphate buffer partition ratios (P-values). 5. The persistence of compounds in the enterohepatic circulation is determined by the faecal and urinary elimination of the circulating compounds. Faecal elimination is governed by the extent of intestinal absorption of the circulating compounds, which is influenced by the efficacy of intestinal hydrolysis of the conjugates and the relative lipophilicity of the aglycones released. Aryl-chlorides and -fluorides are common building blocks, but their use in synthesis is limited by the high stability of their Ar-X bonds. The generation of aryl radicals via activation of strong Ar-X bonds is possible through the irradiation of tailor-made organic anions, which become reductants stronger than lithium metal. We report that the combination of visible light with the cheap diphenylacetic acid dianion is an even better tool, showing excellent activity across a variety of complex substrates and providing opportunities for late-stage drug modification. Ar-X bonds are chemoselectively activated in the presence of more easily reducible functions, such as Alk-Cl ones and carbonyl groups. These results pave the way to original synthetic strategies that would be otherwise considered impossible. Various optically active 2-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone derivatives are produced via the kinetic resolution of racemic 2-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactones with diphenylacetic acid using pivalic anhydride and (R)-benzotetramisole ((R)-BTM), a chiral acyl-transfer catalyst. Importantly, the substrate scope of this novel protocol is fairly broad (12 examples, s-value; up to over 1000). In addition, we succeeded in disclosing the reaction mechanism to afford high enantioselectivity using theoretical calculations and expounded on the substituent effects at the C-3 positions in 2-hydroxylactones.

532	Papc	PUBMED	 Paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) plays a crucial role in morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and somitogenesis in mouse, zebrafish and Xenopus. PAPC influences cell-cell adhesion mediated by C-Cadherin. A putative direct adhesion activity of PAPC is discussed. PAPC also promotes cell elongation, tissue separation and coordinates cell mass movements. In these processes the signaling function of PAPC in activating RhoA/JNK and supporting Wnt-11/PCP by binding to frizzled 7 (fz7) is important. Here we demonstrate by loss of function experiments in Xenopus embryos that PAPC regulates another type of morphogenetic movement, the invagination of the ear placode. Knockdown of PAPC by antisense morpholinos results in deformation of the otic vesicle without altering otocyst marker expression. Depletion of PAPC could be rescued by full-length PAPC, constitutive active RhoA and by the closely related PCNS but not by classical cadherins. Also the cytoplasmic deletion mutant M-PAPC, which influences cell adhesion, does not rescue the PAPC knockdown. Interestingly, depletion of Wnt5a or Ror2 which are also expressed in the otocyst phenocopies the PAPC morphant phenotype. PAPC signaling via RhoA and Wnt5a/Ror2 activity are required to keep cells aligned in apical-basal orientation during invagination of the ear placode. Since neither the cytoplasmic deletion mutant M-PAPC nor a classical cadherin is able to rescue loss of PAPC we suggest that the signaling function of the protocadherin rather than its role as modulator of cell-cell adhesion is required during invagination of the ear placode. Cleft-like boundaries represent a type of cell sorting boundary characterized by the presence of a physical gap between tissues. We studied the cleft-like ectoderm-mesoderm boundary in Xenopus laevis and zebrafish gastrulae. We identified the transcription factor Snail1 as being essential for tissue separation, showed that its expression in the mesoderm depends on noncanonical Wnt signaling, and demonstrated that it enables paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) to promote tissue separation through two novel functions. First, PAPC attenuates planar cell polarity signaling at the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary to lower cell adhesion and facilitate cleft formation. Second, PAPC controls formation of a distinct type of adhesive contact between mesoderm and ectoderm cells that shows properties of a cleft-like boundary at the single-cell level. It consists of short stretches of adherens junction-like contacts inserted between intermediate-sized contacts and large intercellular gaps. These roles of PAPC constitute a self/non-self-recognition mechanism that determines the site of boundary formation at the interface between PAPC-expressing and -nonexpressing cells. Vertebrate segmentation is characterized by the periodic formation of epithelial somites from the mesenchymal presomitic mesoderm (PSM). How the rhythmic signaling pulse delivered by the segmentation clock is translated into the periodic morphogenesis of somites remains poorly understood. Here, we focused on the role of paraxial protocadherin (	ENDOGENOUS	ENDOGENOUS	{'END': -0.011635042, 'O': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}
535	Nicotiflorin	PUBMED	 The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is on the rise globally and the development of drugs targeting UC is urgent. Finding the target of action of natural products is important for drug discovery, elucidation of drug action mechanism, and disease mechanism. San-Ye-Qing (SYQ), is an ancient herbal medicine, but whether the powder of its rhizome has pharmacological effects against UC and its mechanism of action are not clear. To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of rhizome powder of SYQ in treating UC, and conduct an isolation and characterization of the chemical constituents of the powder. Further, screen the most potent compounds among them and determine the potential mechanism for treating UC. In vivo, the therapeutic effect of SYQ's rhizome powder on UC was assessed by mice's body weight, DAI score, colon length, tissue MPO activity, serum inflammatory markers, etc. Additionally, HPLC was used to isolate and identify the specific chemical components of SYQ's rhizome powder. Then, the most effective compounds and their therapeutic targets were analysed and screened in SYQ rhizome powder using network pharmacology, combined with CCK-8 assay, NO release assay and molecular docking assay, in conjunction with CETSA, DARTS, SPR and enzyme activity assay. Finally, the biological effects of the key compound on the targets were validated using Western blot and ELISA. In vivo, SYQ rhizome powder effectively restored mice's body weight, lowered DAI and pathological score, downregulated the expression of inflammatory biomarkers, and restored colon length, as well as the colonic epithelial and mucus barriers. Afterward, 9 compounds were isolated and identified from the powder of the rhizomes of SYQ by HPLC. Nicotiflorin is the primary compound in SYQ with the highest concentration. According to both CCK-8 and NO release tests, Nicotiflorin is also the most efficacious compound. Combined with network pharmacological prediction, molecular docking analysis, CETSA, DARTS, SPR and enzyme activity assay, Nicotiflorin may ultimately suppress inflammation by targeting p65 and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, thereby attenuating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. To verify this conclusion, Western blot and ELISA experiments were conducted. Our results suggest that the extract from SYQ rhizomes has therapeutic properties for UC. Its active ingredient Nicotiflorin exerted potent anti-UC effects by binding to p65 and inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to alcoholic liver diseases (ALDs).  Forty mice were used in this study. After treatment of Kaempferol and nicotiflorin, serum and liver were collected and used for determination of biochemical indicators, H&E staining, and molecular detection. The interaction of miRNAs from serum extracellular vehicles (EVs) with mRNAs and 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota were also investigated. The results showed that kaempferol and nicotiflorins significantly ameliorated alcohol-induced liver damage and observably regulated gut microbiota. Specifically, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and CYP2E1 in the liver significantly reduced, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in the liver evidently increased. They also significantly relieved liver oxidative stress and lipid accumulation by suppressing miR-138-5p expression, inversely enhancing deacetylase silencing information regulator 2 related enzyme-1 (SIRT1) levels and then decreasing farnesoid X receptor (FXR) acetylation, which then modulated Nrf2 and SREBP-1c signaling pathways to regulate oxidative stress and lipid metabolism induced by alcohol. Kaempferol and nicotiflorin reduced alcohol-induced liver damage by enhancing alcohol metabolism and reducing oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. The intestinal microorganism disorder was also ameliorated after oral kaempferol and nicotiflorin. Nicotiflorin is the main characteristic component of Nymphaea candida, which is a natural product that reportedly ameliorates acute injury of the liver and cerebral cortex, but the effect of nicotiflorin on acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of nicotiflorin on ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) AKI and the associated mechanisms. We performed both (a) in vivo experiments with C57BL/6 mice with bilateral renal pedicles clamped for 45 minutes and (b) in vitro experiments with human kidney epithelial cells (HK-2) exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation to mimic I/R injury to study the role of nicotiflorin in AKI. In vivo, nicotiflorin administration exerted protective effects on renal injury, as demonstrated by reductions in the levels of caspase3 and Bad (P < .05), the upregulation of Bcl-2 expression (P < .05) and improved renal histologic changes, which suggested that nicotiflorin can alleviate I/R injury and cell apoptosis. In vitro, nicotiflorin at a concentration of 75 μg/mL protected cells from hypoxia, which further confirmed that nicotiflorin exerts beneficial effects on hypoxia/reoxygenation. Through computational molecular docking, we found that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) exhibits a robust interaction with nicotiflorin with a simulated binding energy of -9.2°. We verified the interaction of nicotiflorin with ATF3 in HK-2 cells, and found that nicotiflorin reduced the apoptosis of HK-2 through ATF3. Based on the above-described results, nicotiflorin appears to have a beneficial impact on deteriorated renal function, as demonstrated using an experimental I/R model. The underlying mechanisms of nicotiflorin might inhibit HK-2 cell apoptosis through ATF3.	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL, FOOD	{'MED': -0.10008836, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': -1.2664457e-06, ' FOOD': -4.246537e-06}
538	Cholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	Cholic acid, also known as 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid is a primary bile acid that is insoluble in water (soluble in alcohol and acetic acid), it is a white crystalline substance. Salts of cholic acid are called cholates. Cholic acid, along with chenodeoxycholic acid, is one of the two major bile acids produced by the liver, where it is synthesized from cholesterol. These two major bile acids are roughly equal in concentration in humans. Derivatives are made from cholyl-CoA, which exchanges its CoA with either glycine, or taurine, yielding glycocholic and taurocholic acid, respectively. Cholic acid downregulates cholesterol-7-α-hydroxylase (rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis), and cholesterol does the opposite. This is why chenodeoxycholic acid, and not cholic acid, can be used to treat gallstones (because decreasing bile acid synthesis would supersaturate the stones even more). Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are the most important human bile acids. Other species may synthesize different bile acids as their predominant primary bile acids. == Medical uses == Cholic acid, sold under the brand name Cholbam, is approved for use in the United States and is indicated as a treatment for children and adults with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for peroxisomal disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. It was approved for use in the European Union in September 2013, and is sold under the brand name Orphacol. It is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile-acid synthesis due to 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency in infants, children and adolescents aged one month to 18 years and adults. Cholic acid FGK (Kolbam) was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2015. It is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis, in infants from one month of age for continuous lifelong treatment through adulthood, encompassing the following single enzyme defects: sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, CTX); 2- (or alpha-) methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency; cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) deficiency. The most common side effects include peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet), diarrhea, nausea (feeling sick), acid reflux (stomach acid flowing up into the mouth), esophagitis (inflammation of the food pipe), jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), skin problems (lesions) and malaise (feeling unwell). == Interactive pathway map == Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. == References ==	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS	{'MED': -0.41026816, 'ICAL': 0.0, ',': 0.0, ' EN': -1.4855664e-05, 'DO': 0.0, 'GEN': 0.0, 'OUS': 0.0}

62	566-24-5	PUBMED	 Strains of Eggerthella lenta are capable of oxidation-reduction reactions capable of oxidizing and epimerizing bile acid hydroxyl groups. Several genes encoding these enzymes, known as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) have yet to be identified. It is also uncertain whether the products of E. lenta bile acid metabolism are further metabolized by other members of the gut microbiota. We characterized a novel human fecal isolate identified as E. lenta strain C592. The complete genome of E. lenta strain C592 was sequenced and comparative genomics with the type strain (DSM 2243) revealed high conservation, but some notable differences. E. lenta strain C592 falls into group III, possessing 3α, 3β, 7α, and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, as determined by mass spectrometry of thin layer chromatography (TLC) separated metabolites of primary and secondary bile acids. Incubation of E. lenta oxo-bile acid and iso-bile acid metabolites with whole-cells of the high-activity bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, Clostridium scindens VPI 12708, resulted in minimal conversion of oxo-derivatives to lithocholic acid (LCA). Further, Iso-chenodeoxycholic acid (iso-CDCA; 3β,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid) was not metabolized by C. scindens. We then located a gene encoding a novel 12α-HSDH in E. lenta DSM 2243, also encoded by strain C592, and the recombinant purified enzyme was characterized and substrate-specificity determined. Genomic analysis revealed genes encoding an Rnf complex (rnfABCDEG), an energy conserving hydrogenase (echABCDEF) complex, as well as what appears to be a complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Our prediction that by changing the gas atmosphere from nitrogen to hydrogen, bile acid oxidation would be inhibited, was confirmed. These results suggest that E. lenta is an important bile acid metabolizing gut microbe and that the gas atmosphere may be an important and overlooked regulator of bile acid metabolism in the gut. We describe a detailed study of the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid administration on bile acid composition of the serum and bile of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze bile acids from 10 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis before and during ursodeoxycholic acid administration (500 mg/day, corresponding to approximately 8 mg/kg body wt), after group separation of the unconjugated and conjugated fractions by lipophilic anion exchange chromatography. These studies were directed at assessing whether the beneficial role of ursodeoxycholic acid in primary biliary cirrhosis was the consequence of a shift in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the bile acid pool and whether the hypercholeresis might result from the cholehepatic circulation of unconjugated ursodeoxycholic acid in bile. In basal conditions, the unconjugated bile acids accounted for only 5.5% and 2.5%, respectively, of the total bile acids of serum and bile; cholic acid was the major component of the conjugated fraction of serum and bile (56.0% +/- 4.0%, mean +/- S.E.M.), and ursodeoxycholic acid was present in only trace amounts. The conjugated fraction contained many unusual bile acids (representing 16.5% +/- 1.3% of total) including C25 bile acids, iso-chenodeoxycholic acid and several oxo-bile acids. After ursodeoxycholic acid administration biochemical indices of liver function all improved, but the proportions of the unconjugated bile acids in serum and bile did not significantly change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -0.068745345}
63	602-85-7	WIKIPEDIA	"LOL, or lol, is an initialism for laughing out loud, and a popular element of Internet slang, which can be used to indicate amusement, irony, or double meanings. It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO (""laughing my ass off"") and ROFL or ROTFL (""rolling on the floor laughing""). In 2003, the list of acronyms was said to ""grow by the month"", and they were collected along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, IRC, and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication. These initialisms are controversial, and several authors recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications. The Oxford English Dictionary first listed LOL in March 2011. == History == In the early to mid-1980s, Wayne Pearson was reportedly the first person to have used LOL while responding to a friend's joke in a pre-Internet digital chat room called Viewline. Instead of writing ""hahaha,"" as he had done before when he found something humorous, Pearson stated that he instead typed ""LOL"" to symbolize extreme laughter. Although the account is commonly accepted as true, no written record of the conversation has been found, and the exact date of origin is unknown.: 82–83 The earliest recorded mention of LOL in the contemporary meaning of ""Laughing Out Loud"" was made in a list of common online acronyms on the May 8, 1989 issue of the electronic newsletter FidoNews, according to the Oxford English Dictionary and linguist Ben Zimmer.: 83 A 2003 study of college students by Naomi Baron found that the use of these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually lower than she had expected. The students ""used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons"". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total; 76 were occurrences of LOL.On March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other acronyms, was formally recognized in an update of the Oxford English Dictionary. In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for ""little old lady"" in the 1960s. Gabriella Coleman references ""lulz"" extensively in her anthropological studies of Anonymous. LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystal – likening the introduction of LOL, ROFL, and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the 15th century – states that this is ""a brand new variety of language evolving"", invented by young people within five years, that ""extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language"". However Geoffrey K. Pullum argues that even if interjections such as LOL and ROFL were to become very common in spoken English, their ""total effect on language"" would be ""utterly trivial"". While LOL originally meant ""laughing out loud,"" modern usage is different, and it is commonly used for irony, as an indicator of second meanings, and as a way to soften statements. == Analysis == Silvio Laccetti (professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology) and Scott Molski, in their essay entitled The Lost Art of Writing, are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, ""Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not 'lol' when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made-up words, and silly acronyms."" Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that smileys and abbreviations are ""no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication"". Linguist John McWhorter stated, ""Lol is being used in a particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles..."" Pragmatic particles are the words and phrases utilized to alleviate the awkward areas in casual conversation, such as oh in ""Oh, I don't know"" and uh when someone is thinking of something to say. McWhorter stated that lol is utilized less as a reaction to something that is hilarious, but rather as a way to lighten the conversation. Frank Yunker and Stephen Barry, in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through podcasting, have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are ""often misunderstood"" by students and are ""difficult to decipher"" unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of ""ROFL"" as not obviously being the abbreviation of ""rolling on the floor laughing"" (emphasis added). Matt Haig describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that ""as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing"". Hossein Bidgoli advises that such initialisms should be used ""only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning"" as they ""might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver"", and differences in meaning may lead to misunderstandings in international contexts. Tim Shortis observes that ROFL is a means of ""annotating text with stage directions"". Peter Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: ""The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor."" David Crystal notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question ""How many people are actually 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?"". Louis Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL. Victoria Clarke, in her analysis of telnet talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that ""a user who types LOL may well be laughing louder than one who types lol"", and opines that ""these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse"". Michael Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful so long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are in his view appropriate in such correspondence. June Hines Moore shares that view. So, too, does Sheryl Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, ""or you won't be LOL"". == Variations on the theme == === Variants === lul: phonetic spelling of LOL. ""LUL"" is also commonly used in the gaming community, due to it being an emote on Twitch, which depicts game critic TotalBiscuit laughing. lolz: Occasionally used in place of LOL. lulz: Often used to denote laughter at someone who is the victim of a prank, or a reason for performing an action. Its use originated with Internet trolls. According to a New York Times article about Internet trolling, ""lulz means the joy of disrupting another's emotional equilibrium."" Can be used as a noun – e.g. ""do it for the lulz."", shortened into ""ftlulz"" (to distinguish it from ""ftl"" – ""for the loss""). See also LulzSec. LOLOLOL...: For added emphasis, LOL can be appended with any number of additional iterations of ""OL"". In cases such as these, the abbreviation is not to be read literally (i.e., ""Laughing out loud out loud out loud out loud""), but is meant to suggest several LOLs in a row. OMEGALUL and LULW: variants of ""LUL"" used as a Twitch emote. trolololol or trollololol: A blend of troll and LOL iterated, likely meant to mimick Eduard Khil's 1976 song Mr. Trololo song, which became an internet meme in 2010. Indicates that the prank or joke was made by internet trolls, or the user thinks the prank or joke qualifies as internet trolling. === Derivations === (to) LOL: Used as a verb (""to laugh out loud"") and is meant to be conjugated in the appropriate tense. When the past tense is meant, it is written as ""LOL(e)d"" or ""LOL'd"". lolwut (sometimes ""lulwut""): lol + wut, used to indicate bemused laughter, or confusion. lawl, lawlz, or lal: Pseudo-pronunciation of LOL. Saying ""lawl"" is sometimes meant in mockery of those who use the term LOL and is not meant to express laughter. Lel or LEL is a ""playful or ironic"" variation of LOL. It is sometimes thought to be an initialism, standing for ""laughing extremely loud"" or ""laughing extra loud"", but this has been disputed. lolcat, an image macro of a cat === Related === *G* or *g*: For ""grins"". Like ""lulz"" it is used in the initialism ""J4G"" (""just for grins""). kek: A term for laughter that originated in online games, possibly either World of Warcraft or StarCraft, the latter in which Korean players would type ""kekeke"" as onomatopoeia for laughter. It later became associated with alt-right politics, in the form of a parody religion surrounding the character Pepe the Frog by analogy with the frog-headed ancient Egyptian god Kek. LMAO: For ""laughing my arse/ass off"". Variants: LMBO (""Laughing my butt off""), LMFAO (""Laughing my fucking ass off""). lqtm: For ""Laughing quietly to myself"". ROFL: For ""rolling on the floor laughing"". It is often combined with LMAO for added emphasis as ROFLMAO (""Rolling on the floor laughing my ass off"") or ROFLMFAO (Rolling on the floor laughing my fucking ass off). roflcopter: A portmanteau of ROFL and helicopter. A popular glitch in the Microsoft Sam text-to-speech engine enables the voice to make a sound akin to the rotation of rotor blades when 'SOI' or 'SOY' is entered, and the phrase 'My ROFLcopter goes soi soi soi..."" is often associated with the term as a result. PMSL: For ""pissing myself laughing"". IJBOL: For ""I just burst out laughing"". Gaining popularity among Gen Z, initially popularized within the K-pop fandom. Not derived from Korean. XD, sometimes stylized as xD, xd, or Xd, is an emoticon commonly used to symbolize extreme laughter or happiness. === Commonly used equivalents in other languages === Pre-dating the Internet and phone texting by a century, the way to express laughter in morse code is ""hi hi"". The sound of this in morse ('di-di-di-dit di-dit, di-di-di-dit di-dit') is thought to represent chuckling. 555: the Thai variation of LOL. ""5"" in Thai is pronounced ""ha"", three of them being ""hahaha"" (ห้า ห้า ห้า). asg: Swedish abbreviation of the term asgarv, meaning intense laughter. g: Danish abbreviation of the word griner, which means ""laughing"" in Danish. jajajá: in Spanish, the letter ""j"" is pronounced /x/. jejeje: in the Philippines is used to represent ""hehehe"". ""j"" in Filipino languages is pronounced as /h/, derived from the Spanish /x/. Its origins can be traced to SMS language. It is widely used in a Filipino youth subculture known as Jejemons. mdr: Esperanto version, from the initials of multe da ridoj, which translates to ""lot of laughs"" in English. mdr: French version, from the initials of ""mort de rire"" which roughly translated means ""died of laughter"", although many French people also use LOL instead as it is the most widely used on the internet. mkm: in Afghanistan ""mkm"" (being an abbreviation of the phrase ""ma khanda mikonom""). This is a Dari phrase that means ""I am laughing"". ptdr: French variant from pété de rire – literally meaning ""broken with laughter"" rs: in Brazil ""rs"" (being an abbreviation of ""risos"", the plural of ""laugh"") is often used in text based communications in situations where in English LOL would be used, repeating it (""rsrsrsrsrs"") is often done to express longer laughter or laughing harder. Also popular is ""kkk"" (which can also be repeated indefinitely), due to the pronunciation of the letter k in Brazilian Portuguese sounding similar to the ca in card, and therefore representing the laugh ""cacacacaca"" (also similar to the Hebrew version below). חחח/ההה: Hebrew version of LOL. The letter ח is pronounced [/x/ /x/] and ה is pronounced [/h/ /h/]. Putting them together (usually three or more in a row) makes the word khakhakha or hahaha (since vowels in Hebrew are generally not written), which is in many languages regarded as the sound of laughter. ㅋㅋㅋ (""kkk"" or ""kekeke"") and ㅎㅎㅎ (""hhh"") are usually used to indicate laughter in Korean. 'ㅋ', is a Korean Jamo consonant representing a ""k"" sound, and 'ㅎ' represents an ""h"" sound. Both ""ㅋㅋㅋ"" and ""ㅎㅎㅎ"" represent laughter which is not very loud. However, if a vowel symbol is written, louder laughter is implied: 하하 ""haha"" 호호, ""hoho."" (笑): in Japanese, the kanji for laugh, is used in the same way as lol. It can be read as kakko warai (literally ""parentheses laugh"") or just wara. w is also used as an abbreviation, and it is common for multiple w to be chained together. The resulting shape formed from multiple wwwww leads to the usage of 草 ( 草 meaning grass, read as kusa), due to its resemblance to the shape of grass. === The word ""lol"" in other languages === In Dutch, lol is a word (not an acronym) which, coincidentally, means ""fun"" (""lollig"" means ""funny""). In Welsh, lol means ""nonsense"" or ""ridiculous"" – e.g., if a person wanted to say ""utter nonsense"" in Welsh, they would say ""lol wirion"" or ""rwtsh lol"". == See also == Face with Tears of Joy emoji (😂) Internet meme Leet == References == == Further reading == Connery, Brian A.

71	N-methyl-n-oleoyltaurine	PUBMED	 The amphoteric surfactant N-oleoyl-N-methyltaurine, which is in use in skin-care products, was utilized by aerobic bacteria as the sole source of carbon or of nitrogen in enrichment cultures. One isolate, which was identified as Pseudomonas alcaligenes, grew with the xenobiotic compound as the sole source of carbon and energy. The sulfonate moiety, N-methyltaurine, was excreted quantitatively during growth, while the fatty acid was dissimilated. The initial degradative reaction was shown to be hydrolytic and inducible. This amidase reaction could be demonstrated with crude cell extracts. The excreted N-methyltaurine could be utilized by other bacteria in cocultures. Complete degradation of similar natural compounds in bacterial communities seems likely.	PERSONAL CARE	PERSONAL CARE	{'PERSON': -0.000508115, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}

132	56121-42-7	PUBMED	 Aurantiamide and aurantiamide acetate are the main active constituents of purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), an edible plant with various biological activities. In this study, we developed a validated UHPLC-MS/MS method to quantitate the concentrations of aurantiamide and aurantiamide acetate in the plasma and various organ tissues of rat as the basis to study their pharmacological profile and distribution in vivo. Aurantiamide and aurantiamide acetate were rapidly absorbed following oral administration, both achieving a Cmax at around 0.2 h. The extent of their metabolisms also varied among different organ tissues, resulting in about 90% reduction in concentrations 4 h after their administration, thus leaving no long-term accumulation in the tissues. This is the first study to examine the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution of aurantiamide and aurantiamide acetate in rat, and our work may serve as the first step toward the investigation of the underlying mechanisms associated with the biological activity of purslane. Aurantiamide acetate (AA) is a dipeptide derivative with complex pharmacological activities and remarkable effects on preventing and treating various diseases. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether AA can exert protective effects in a mouse model of ALI induced by LPS. In this model, mice were given intranasal LPS for 3 days prior to receiving AA (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) via oral gavage. An assessment of histopathological changes was performed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Proinflammatory cytokines were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The effects of AA on protein expression of NF- According to results, AA pretreatment significantly reduced lung pathological changes, W/D ratio, MPO activity, and protein content. Additionally, AA resulted in a significant reduction in the number of total cells, neutrophils, and proinflammatory cytokines in the BALF after LPS stimulation. The subsequent study revealed that pretreatment with AA dose dependently suppressed LPS-induced activation of NF- The results indicated that the AA had a protective effect on LPS-induced ALI in mice and could be a potential drug for ALI. We aim to investigate the effect of aurantiamide acetate isolated from the aerial parts of Clematis terniflora DC against gliomas. Human malignant glioma U87 and U251 cells were incubated with different concentrations (0-100 μM) of aurantiamide acetate. Aurantiamide acetate greatly decreased the cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It induced moderate mitochondrial fragmentation and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. No significant difference was found in the alternation of other intracellular organelles, although F-actin structure was slightly disturbed. Apparent ultrastructure alternation with increased autophagosome and autolysosome accumulation was observed in aurantiamide acetate-treated cells. The expression of LC3-II was greatly up-regulated in cells exposed to aurantiamide acetate (P < 0.05 compared with control). The cytoplasmic accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes induced by aurantiamide acetate treatment was confirmed by fluorescent reporter protein labelling. Administration of chloroquine (CQ), which inhibits the fusion step of autophagosomes, further increased the accumulation of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm of U87 cells. Autophagy inhibition by 3-methyladenine, Bafilomycin A1 or CQ had no influence on aurantiamide acetate-induced cytotoxicity, whereas autophagy stimulator rapamycin significantly suppressed aurantiamide acetate-induced cell death. The anti-tumour effects of aurantiamide acetate were further evaluated in tumour-bearing nude mice. Intratumoural injection of aurantiamide acetate obviously suppressed tumour growth, and increased number of autophagic vacuoles was observed in tumour tissues of animals receiving aurantiamide acetate. Our findings suggest that aurantiamide acetate may suppress the growth of malignant gliomas by blocking autophagic flux.

145	Lauramidopropylbetaine	WIKIPEDIA	Cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) is a mixture of closely related organic compounds derived from coconut oil and dimethylaminopropylamine. CAPB is available as a viscous pale yellow solution and it is used as a surfactant in personal care products and animal husbandry. The name reflects that the major part of the molecule, the lauric acid group, is derived from coconut oil. Cocamidopropyl betaine to a significant degree has replaced cocamide DEA. == Production == Despite the name cocamidopropyl betaine, the molecule is not synthesized from betaine. Instead it is produced in a two-step manner, beginning with the reaction of dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) with fatty acids from coconut or palm kernel oil (lauric acid, or its methyl ester, is the main constituent). The primary amine in DMAPA is more reactive than the tertiary amine, leading to its selective addition to form an amide. In the second step chloroacetic acid reacts with the remaining tertiary amine to form a quaternary ammonium center (a quaternization reaction). CH3(CH2)10COOH + H2NCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 → CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 + ClCH2CO2H + NaOH → CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N+(CH3)2CH2CO2− + NaCl + H2O == Chemistry == CAPB is a fatty acid amide that contains a long hydrocarbon chain at one end and a polar group at the other. This allows CAPB to act as a surfactant and as a detergent. It is a zwitterion, consisting of both a quaternary ammonium cation and a carboxylate. == Specifications and properties == Cocamidopropyl betaine is used as a foam booster in shampoos. It is a medium-strength surfactant also used in bath products like hand soaps. It is also used in cosmetics as an emulsifying agent and thickener, and to reduce the irritation that purely ionic surfactants would cause. It also serves as an antistatic agent in hair conditioners, which most often does not irritate skin or mucous membranes. However, some studies indicate it is an allergen. CAPB is also used as a co-surfactant with Sodium dodecyl sulfate for promoting the formation of gas hydrates. CAPB, as an additive, helps to scale up the gas hydrates' formation process. CAPB is obtained as an aqueous solution in concentrations of about 30%. Typical impurities of leading manufacturers today: Sodium monochloroacetate < 5 ppm Amidoamine (AA) < 0.3% Dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) < 15 ppm Glycerol < 3% The impurities AA and DMAPA are most critical, as they have been shown to be responsible for skin sensitization reactions. These by-products can be avoided by a moderate excess chloroacetate and the exact adjustment of pH value during betainization reaction accompanied by regular analytical control. == Safety == CAPB has been claimed to cause allergic reactions in some users, but a controlled pilot study has found that these cases may represent irritant reactions rather than true allergic reactions. Furthermore, results of human studies have shown that CAPB has a low sensitizing potential if impurities with amidoamine (AA) and dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) are low and tightly controlled. Other studies have concluded that most apparent allergic reactions to CAPB are more likely due to amidoamine. Cocamidopropyl betaine was voted 2004 Allergen of the Year by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. == See also == Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine == References ==	PERSONAL CARE	PERSONAL CARE	{'PERSON': -1.9816675e-06, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}

170	Terbucarb	PUBMED	 The subacute toxicity and effects of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl N-methylcarbamate (terbutol) on hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450) were investigated in male and female F344 rats. Rats were given 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0% terbutol for 28 days. Liver weights of male and female rats increased at all dose levels. The compound did not affect activity or amount of serum biochemical markers related to hepatic damage. The concentrations of terbutol in rat serum were less than 0.1 microM, and its major metabolites in serum were 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-carboxyphenyl N-methyl-carbamate and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-carboxyphenol. In male rats, P450 and cytochrome b5 (b5) contents, and NADPH cytochrome c reductase (fp2) activity in liver microsomes were increased about 2-fold by 1% terbutol administration for 7 to 28 days. Among the P450-dependent monooxygenase activities in liver microsomes, 7-benzyloxyresorufin-O-debenzylase (BROD) activity was greatly increased by 100-fold, and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECOD), and aminopyrine-N-demethylase (APND) activities were elevated 2- to 3-fold. 7-Methoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (MROD), erythromycin-N-demethylase (EMND), estradiol 2-hydroxylase (ED2H), chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase (CZ6H), and lauric acid omega-hydroxylase (LAOH) activities were unchanged. For the activities of testosterone hydroxylation, testosterone 16beta-hydroxylase (T16BH) activity was markedly increased by 30-fold, and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase (T6BH) and testosterone 7alpha-hydroxylase (T7AH) activities were slightly elevated. Testosterone 2alpha-hydroxylase (T2AH) activity was not affected. Terbutol 4-methylhydroxylase (T4MH) activity was increased 9-fold by 1% terbutol. In an immunoinhibition study, T4MH activity in liver microsomes from 1% terbutol-treated rats was decreased about 50% by polyclonal anti-rat CYP2B1, whereas polyclonal anti-rat CYP2A1 and CYP2C11 did not affected the activity. These results indicate that terbutol increased CYP2B subfamily in rat liver microsomes, and that the compound did not cause serious hepatic damage. The cytotoxic effects of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl N-methylcarbamate (terbutol) and its major metabolites were investigated in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. Terbutol and its metabolite, especially 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl carbamate (N-demethylterbutol), at a concentration of 1.0 mM resulted in a time dependent cell killing accompanied by losses of intracellular ATP, protein thiols, and glutathione (GSH) and the accumulation of oxidized GSH. Supplementation of the hepatocyte suspension with 5 mM N-acetylcysteine, a precursor of intracellular GSH, inhibited the cytotoxicity of N-demethylterbutol. In mitochondria isolated from rat liver, terbutol and its metabolites impaired respiration related to oxidative phosphorylation and the potency of their toxicity is associated with impairment of mitochondrial respiration. These results indicate that N-demethylterbutol is the most cytotoxic followed by terbutol and other metabolites, and that both the mitochondrial respiratory system and protein thiols are important targets for these compounds.

173	1,2-dipalmitoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine	PUBMED	 Myocardial infarction (MI) is a serious cardiovascular disease, which presents different pathophysiological changes with the prolongation of the disease. Compound danshen dripping pills (CDDP) has obvious advantages in MI treatment and widely used in the clinic. However, the current studies were mostly focused on the endpoint of CDDP intervention, lacking the dynamic attention to the disease process. It is of great value to establish a dynamic research strategy focused on the changes in pharmacodynamic substances for guiding clinical medication more precisely. It is aimed to explore the dynamic regulating pattern of CDDP on MI based on metabolic trajectory analysis, and then clarify the variation characteristic biomarkers and pharmacodynamic substances in the intervention process. The MI model was successfully prepared by coronary artery left anterior descending branch ligation, and then CDDP intervention was given for 28 days. Endogenous metabolites and the components of CDDP in serum were measured by LC/MS technique simultaneously to identify dynamic the metabolic trajectory and screen the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances at different points. Finally, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to simulate the core pharmacodynamic substances and core target binding, then validated at the genetic and protein level by Q-PCR and western blotting technology. CDDP performed typical dynamic regulation features on metabolite distribution, biological processes, and pharmacodynamic substances. During 1-7 days, it mainly regulated lipid metabolism and inflammation, the Phosphatidylcholine (PC(18:1(9Z/18:1(9Z)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z)), SM(d18:1/24:1(15Z)), SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z))) were the main characteristic biomarkers. Lipid metabolism was the mainly regulation pathway during 14-21 days, and the characteristic biomarkers were the Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE(0:0/20:0), PE-NMe2(22:1(13Z)/15:0)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z))). At 28 days, in addition to inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism also played the most important role. Correspondingly, Lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC(20:0/0:0)), Lysophosphatidylserine (LPS(18:0/0:0)) and Fatty acids (Linoelaidic acid) were the characteristic biomarkers. Based on the results of metabolite distribution and biological process, the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances during the intervention were further identified. The results showed that various kinds of Saponins and Tanshinones as the important active ingredients performed a long-range regulating effect on MI. And the other components, such as Tanshinol and Salvianolic acid B affected Phosphatidylcholine and Sphingomyelin through Relaxin Signaling pathway during the early intervention. Protocatechualdehyde and Rosmarinic acid affected Lysophosphatidylethanolamine and Sphingomyelin through EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance during the late intervention. Tanshinone IIB and Isocryptotanshinone via PPAR signaling pathway affected Lysophosphatidylcholine, Lysophosphatidylserine, and Fatty acids. The dynamic regulating pattern was taken as the entry point and constructs the dynamic network based on metabolic trajectory analysis, establishes the dynamic correlation between the drug-derived components and the endogenous metabolites, and elucidates the characteristic biomarkers affecting the changes of the pharmacodynamic indexes, systematically and deeply elucidate the pharmacodynamic substance and mechanism of CDDP on MI. It also enriched the understanding of CDDP and provided a methodological reference for the dynamic analysis of complex systems of TCM. In traditional Chinese medicine, Gynostemma pentaphyllum (G. pentaphyllum) is widely used to treat conditions associated with hyperlipidemia, and its therapeutic potential has been demonstrated in numerous studies. However, the mechanism of lipid metabolism in hyperlipidemic by G. pentaphyllum, especially heat-processed G. pentaphyllum is not yet clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of gypenosides from heat-processed G. pentaphyllum (HGyp) in hyperlipidemic mice by means of a lipidomics. The content of the major components of HGyp was determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS). An animal model of hyperlipidaemia was constructed using C57BL/6J mice fed with high-fat diet. HGyp was also administered at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, all for 12 weeks. Serum parameters were measured, histological sections were prepared and liver lipidome analysis using UPLC-MS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to analyze the genes and proteins associated with lipid lowering in HGyp. HGyp reduced body weight, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and hepatic lipid accumulation in hyperlipidemic obese mice. To explore specific changes in lipid metabolism in relation to HGyp administration, lipid analysis of the liver was performed. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plots showed that HGyp altered lipid metabolism in HFD mice. In particular, fatty acids (FA), triglycerides (DG), TG and ceramides (CER) were significantly altered. Eleven lipids were identified as potential lipid biomarkers, namely TG (18:2/20:5/18:2), TG (18:2/18:3/20:4), DG (18:3/20:0/0:0), Cer (d18:1/19:0), Cer (d16:1/23:0), Ceramide (d18:1/9Z-18:1), PS (19:0/18:3), PS (20:2/0:0), LysoPC (22:5), LysoPE (0:0/18:0), PE (24:0/16:1). Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis showed that these metabolic improvements played a role by down-regulating genes and proteins related to fat production (SREBP1, ACC1, SCD1), up-regulating genes and proteins related to lipid oxidation (CPTA1, PPARα) and lipid transport decomposition in the bile acid pathway (LXRα, PPARγ, FXR, BSEP). The lipid-lowering effect of gypenosides from heat-processed G. pentaphyllum is regulate lipid homeostasis and metabolism. Cryptosporidium baileyi is an economically important zoonotic pathogen that causes serious respiratory symptoms in chickens for which no effective control measures are currently available. An accumulating body of evidence indicates the potential and usefulness of metabolomics to further our understanding of the interaction between pathogens and hosts, and to search for new diagnostic or pharmacological biomarkers of complex microorganisms. The aim of this study was to identify the impact of C. baileyi infection on the serum metabolism of chickens and to assess several metabolites as potential diagnostic biomarkers for C. baileyi infection. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and subsequent multivariate statistical analysis were applied to investigate metabolomics profiles in the serum samples of chickens infected with C. baileyi, and to identify potential metabolites that can be used to distinguish chickens infected with C. baileyi from non-infected birds. Multivariate statistical analysis identified 138 differential serum metabolites between mock- and C. baileyi-infected chickens at 5 days post-infection (dpi), including 115 upregulated and 23 downregulated compounds. These metabolites were significantly enriched into six pathways, of which two pathways associated with energy and lipid metabolism, namely glycerophospholipid metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism, respectively, were the most enriched. Interestingly, some important immune-related pathways were also significantly enriched, including the intestinal immune network for IgA production, autophagy and cellular senescence. Nine potential C. baileyi-responsive metabolites were identified, including choline, sirolimus, all-trans retinoic acid, PC(14:0/22:1(13Z)), PC(15:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), PE(16:1(9Z)/24:1(15Z)), phosphocholine, SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z)(OH)) and sphinganine. This is the first report on serum metabolic profiling of chickens with early-stage C. baileyi infection. The results provide novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of C. baileyi in chickens.	MEDICAL	INFO	{'INFO': -2.5226382e-05}
179	4201-62-1	PUBMED	 The H(+)-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H(+)-PPase) is a unique, electrogenic proton pump distributed among most land plants, but only some alga, protozoa, bacteria, and archaebacteria. This enzyme is a fine model for research on the coupling mechanism between the pyrophosphate hydrolysis and the active proton transport, since the enzyme consists of a single polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 71-80 kDa and its substrate is also simple. Cloning of the H(+)-PPase genes from several organisms has revealed the conserved regions that may be the catalytic site and/or participate in the enzymatic function. The primary sequences are reviewed with reference to biochemical properties of the enzyme, such as the requirement of Mg(2)(+) and K(+). In plant cells, H(+)-PPase coexists with H(+)-ATPase in a single vacuolar membrane. The physiological significance and the regulation of the gene expression of H(+)-PPase are also reviewed. Dr Schumacher was a force in rheumatology for more than half a century through his multiple roles as a researcher, clinician, mentor, and educator. He is not likely to be soon forgotten by the rheumatology community; however, it is hoped that this chapter can provide a faithful recollection that will help bring his memory to life for some and that rings true to those who knew him and learned from him. Tightly coupled exchange of Na(+) for H(+) occurs across the surface membrane of virtually all living cells. For years, the underlying molecular entity was unknown and the full physiological significance of the exchange process was not appreciated, but much knowledge has been gained in the last two decades. We now realize that, unlike most of the other transporters that specialize in supporting one specific function, Na(+)/H(+) exchangers (NHE) participate in a remarkable assortment of physiological processes, ranging from pH homeostasis and epithelial salt transport, to systemic and cellular volume regulation. In parallel, we have learned a great deal about the biochemistry and molecular biology of Na(+)/H(+) exchange. Indeed, it has now become apparent that exchange is mediated not by one, but by a diverse family of related yet distinct carriers (antiporters) sometimes present in different cell types and located in various intracellular compartments. Each one of these has unique structural features that dictate its functional role and mode of regulation. The biological relevance of Na(+)/H(+) exchange is emphasized by its evolutionary conservation; analogous exchangers are present from bacteria to man. Because of its wide distribution and versatile function, Na(+)/H(+) exchange has attracted an enormous amount of interest and therefore generated a vast literature. The vastness and complexity of the field has been compounded by the multiplicity of NHE isoforms. For reasons of space and in the spirit of this series, this overview is restricted to the family of mammalian NHEs.	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -9.0883464e-07}
194	Echinulin	PUBMED	 A multiway resolution of incomplete chromatographic separation was presented for spectrochromatographic quantification of echinuline in marine-derived fungi Aspergillus chevalieri. Two-dimensional spectrochromatographic maps of calibration, validation and real samples were recorded as a function of time and wavelength using UPLC-PDA instrument under non-optimized chromatographic conditions, which gave rise to co-elution of echinuline and the constituents of sample matrix. A three-way array was obtained by concatenating the data matrices of the spectrochromatographic maps. Then, parallel factor analysis was applied to the multiway array to extract the individual contribution of echinuline in three modes (time, wavelength and sample). While time and wavelength profiles were used for the characterization of echinuline, the sample profile was used for its quantitative determination of the analyte in validation set and in real samples. Validity of the analytical method was evaluated by analyzing the validation set, which consist of test samples, standard addition samples, intra-day and inter-day samples. The proposed multiway analysis method was then applied to marine-derived fungi extracts and echinuline content was found to be 31.9 µg/g based on the average of ten assay results. The assay results provided by PARAFAC model were statistically compared with those obtained by a newly developed classical UPLC method, which ensured the complete separation of echinuline in a run time of nine minutes. The assay results were found to be comparable due to the fact that there was no significant difference between the analysis results (F = 1.63, F	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -0.00013846254}
201	Dtxsid101108284	PUBMED	 Hydroxycinnamic acid amides are a class of secondary metabolites distributed widely in plants. We have identified two sinapoyl spermidine derivatives, N-((4'-O-glycosyl)-sinapoyl),N'-sinapoylspermidine and N,N'-disinapoylspermidine, which comprise the two major polyamine conjugates that accumulate in Arabidopsis thaliana seed. Using metabolic profiling of knockout mutants to elucidate the functions of members of the BAHD acyltransferase family in Arabidopsis, we have also identified two genes encoding spermidine disinapoyl transferase (SDT) and spermidine dicoumaroyl transferase (SCT) activities. At2g23510, which is expressed mainly in seeds, encodes a spermidine sinapoyl CoA acyltransferase (SDT) that is required for the production of disinapoyl spermidine and its glucoside in Arabidopsis seed. The structurally related BAHD enzyme encoded by At2g25150 is expressed specifically in roots and has spermidine coumaroyl CoA acyltransferase (SCT) activity both in vitro and in vivo. Phenolamides, so called hydroxycinnamic acid amides, are specialized metabolites produced in higher plants, involved in development, reproduction and serve as defence compounds in biotic interactions. Among them, trihydroxycinnamoyl spermidine derivatives were initially found to be synthetized by a spermidine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (AtSHT) in Arabidopsis thaliana and to accumulate in the pollen coat. This study reports the identification, in Malus domestica, of an acyltransferase able to complement the sht mutant of Arabidopsis. The quantitative RT-PCR expression profile of MdSHT reveals a specific expression in flowers coordinated with anther development and tapetum cell activities. Three phenolamides including N (1),N (5),N (10)-tricoumaroyl spermidine and N (1),N (5)-dicoumaroyl-N (10)-caffeoyl spermidine identified by LC/MS, were shown to accumulate specifically in pollen grain coat of apple tree. Moreover, in vitro biochemical characterization confirmed MdSHT capacity to synthesize tri-substituted spermidine derivatives with a substrate specificity restricted to p-coumaroyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA as an acyl donor. Further investigations of the presence of tri-substituted hydroxycinnamoyl spermidine conjugates in higher plants were performed by targeted metabolic analyses in pollens coupled with bioinformatic analyses of putative SHT orthologues in a wide range of available plant genomes. This work highlights a probable early evolutionary appearance in the common ancestral core Eudicotyledons of a novel enzyme from the BAHD acyltransferase superfamily, dedicated to the synthesis of trihydroxycinnamoyl spermidines in pollen coat. This pathway was maintained in most species; however, recent evolutionary divergences have appeared among Eudicotyledons, such as an organ reallocation of SHT gene expression in Fabales and a loss of SHT in Malvales and Cucurbitales. Recently, tea (Camellia sinensis) flowers have attracted increasing interest because of their content of bioactive compounds such as catechins. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of some characteristic compounds in tea flowers. A principal component analysis of metabolites using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed differences in metabolite profile between flowers and leaves of C. sinensis var. Yabukita. Four spermidine derivatives were isolated from tea flowers. One of them was determined as N(1) ,N(5) ,N(10) -tricoumaroyl spermidine based on NMR, MS and UV data. The other three were identified as feruoyl dicoumaroyl spermidine, coumaroyl diferuoyl spermidine and triferuoyl spermidine based on MS(n) data. Tricoumaroyl spermidine as the major spermidine conjugate was not detected in tea leaves. Furthermore, it decreased during floral development and mainly occurred in anthers. This study has provided the first evidence that spermidine-phenolic acid conjugates occur in tea flowers in considerable amounts. Their presence should prompt a reconsideration of the ecological role of tea flowers. From an economic point of view, tea flowers might be suitable as a raw material in the healthcare food and pharmaceutical industries.	MEDICAL, FOOD	INFO	{'INFO': -0.5030788}

215	Beta-muricholic acid	PUBMED	 Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

222	55-56-1	PUBMED	 The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of two types of chlorhexidine species, chlorhexidine base and its salts, on the physico-chemical features of liquid crystalline systems and on drug transport through lipophilic membranes. A non-ionic surfactant, Synperonic A7 (PEG7-C13-15) was selected for the preparation of the liquid crystalline systems. Mixtures of different ratios of Synperonic A7 and water were prepared. The liquid crystalline systems were characterized using polarizing microscopy and dynamic oscillatory test. Membrane transport was also examined. The addition of chlorhexidine species to the liquid crystalline system modified the structure of the liquid crystalline system. As a result of the changes of liquid crystalline structures, the drug release of various types of chlorhexidine could be also modified. The combination of the base and salt forms of the drug in one dosage form could eliminate the drug release changes from liquid crystalline systems of dynamically changeable structures. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the gel-forming polysaccharide psyllium in the preparation of mucoadhesive patches for the controlled release of chlorhexidine (CHX) to treat pathologies in the oral cavity, using the casting-solvent evaporation technique. A number of different film-forming semi-synthetic polymers, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) were evaluated for comparison. The patch formulations were characterized in terms of drug content, morphology surface, swelling and mucoadhesive properties, microbiology inhibition assay and in vitro release tests. Three ex-vivo testswere carried out using porcine mucosa: an alternative dissolution test using artificial saliva that allows contemporary measurement of dissolution and mucoadhesion, a permeation test through the mucosa and the measurement of mucoadhesion using a Nouy tensile tester, as the maximum force required for the separation of the patch from the mucosa surface. The patches were also examined for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration in cultures of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. All the patches incorporating psyllium were found suitable in terms of external morphology, mucoadhesion and controlled release of the drug: in the presence of psyllium the drug displays prolonged zero-order release related to slower swelling rate of the system.

262	16849-50-6	PUBMED	 Products containing delta-8-THC became widely available in most of the USA following the 2018 Farm Bill and by late 2020 were core products of hemp processing companies, especially where delta-9-THC use remained illegal or required medical authorization. Research on experiences with delta-8-THC is scarce, some state governments have prohibited it because of this lack of knowledge. We conducted an exploratory study addressing a broad range of issues regarding delta-8-THC to inform policy discussions and provide directions for future systematic research. We developed an online survey for delta-8-THC consumers, including qualities of delta-8-THC experiences, comparisons with delta-9-THC, and open-ended feedback. The survey included quantitative and qualitative aspects to provide a rich description and content for future hypothesis testing. Invitations to participate were distributed by a manufacturer of delta-8-THC products via social media accounts, email contact list, and the Delta8 Reddit.com discussion board. Participants (N = 521) mostly identified as White/European American (90%) and male (57%). Pairwise t tests compared delta-8-THC effect rating items; one-sample t tests examined responses to delta-9-THC comparison items. Most delta-8-THC users experienced a lot or a great deal of relaxation (71%); euphoria (68%) and pain relief (55%); a moderate amount or a lot of cognitive distortions such as difficulty concentrating (81%), difficulties with short-term memory (80%), and alerted sense of time (74%); and did not experience anxiety (74%) or paranoia (83%). Participants generally compared delta-8-THC favorably with both delta-9-THC and pharmaceutical drugs, with most participants reporting substitution for delta-9-THC (57%) and pharmaceutical drugs (59%). Participant concerns regarding delta-8-THC were generally focused on continued legal access. Delta-8-THC may provide much of the experiential benefits of delta-9-THC with lesser adverse effects. Future systematic research is needed to confirm participant reports, although these studies are hindered by the legal statuses of both delta-8-THC and delta-9-THC. Cross-sector collaborations among academics, government officials, and representatives from the cannabis industry may accelerate the generation of knowledge regarding delta-8-THC and other cannabinoids. A strength of this study is that it is the first large survey of delta-8 users, limitations include self-report data from a self-selected convenience sample. A quantitative gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method was developed for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC), tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), and cannabidiol (CBD) in matrices including plant material, liquids and oils, waxes, edibles, and bath and body products. Samples were prepared by homogenization, extraction of the cannabinoids into solvent, liquid/liquid extraction, and derivatization. The GC/MS method was validated from 0.15% to 5.00% (weight basis) to encompass the 0.3% legal distinction between hemp and marijuana. Validation was performed assessing imprecision/bias, calibration model, recovery, interferences, limit of detection, matrix matching, carryover, accuracy, and an assessment of CBD conversion to delta-9-THC. The calibration curves were quadratic weighted 1/x with r A sensitive analytical method was developed for quantitative analysis of delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta(9)-THC), 11-nor-delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-carboxylic acid (delta(9)-THC-COOH), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabidiol (CBD) in human hair. The identification of delta(9)-THC-COOH in hair would document Cannabis use more effectively than the detection of parent drug (delta(9)-THC) which might have come from environmental exposure. Ketamine was added to hair samples as internal standard for CBN and CBD. Ketoprofen was added to hair samples as internal standard for the other compounds. Samples were hydrolyzed with beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase for 2h at 40 degrees C. After cooling, samples were extracted with a liquid-liquid extraction procedure (with chloroform/isopropyl alcohol, after alkalinization, and n-hexane/ethyl acetate, after acidification), which was developed in our laboratory. The extracts were analysed before and after derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride (PFPA) and pentafluoropropanol (PFPOH) using a Hewlett Packard gas chromatographer/mass spectrometer detector, in electron impact mode (GC/MS-EI). Derivatized delta(9)-THC-COOH was also analysed using a Hewlett Packard gas chromatographer/mass spectrometer detector, in negative ion chemical ionization mode (GC/MS-NCI) using methane as the reagent gas. Responses were linear ranging from 0.10 to 5.00 ng/mg hair for delta(9)-THC and CBN, 0.10-10.00 ng/mg hair for CBD, 0.01-5.00 ng/mg for delta(9)-THC-COOH (r(2)>0.99). The intra-assay precisions ranged from <0.01 to 12.40%. Extraction recoveries ranged from 80.9 to 104.0% for delta(9)-THC, 85.9-100.0% for delta(9)-THC-COOH, 76.7-95.8% for CBN and 71.0-94.0% for CBD. The analytical method was applied to 87 human hair samples, obtained from individuals who testified in court of having committed drug related crimes. Quantification of delta(9)-THC-COOH using GC/MS-NCI was found to be more convenient than GC/MS-EI. The latter may give rise to false negatives due to the detection limit.

266	105827-78-9	PUBMED	 This review provides an overview on the fate and behavior of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, in agricultural environments. The study focuses on four key aspects: adsorption and leaching of imidacloprid in soil, degradation and hydrolysis of imidacloprid in soil and water, uptake and persistence of imidacloprid in plants, and volatilization of imidacloprid to the atmosphere. The review presents the latest findings from research on each of these topics. While imidacloprid is highly effective at controlling pests, it is also known to persist in the environment, posing risks to non-target organisms such as bees, birds, and aquatic life. Moreover, there is increasing concern about its potential to accumulate in the soil and water systems, which may have long-term effects on the ecosystem. The review suggests that better understanding of the behavior and fate of imidacloprid in agricultural environments is essential for developing effective strategies to minimize its environmental impact. Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid insecticide highly specific to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in insects and other invertebrates. Nicotinic receptors in mammalian species have a low affinity to neonicotinoids. However, cross-reactivity with mammalian nicotinic receptors is a major concern especially due to the propensity of this commonly used agent to persist in environmental water sources for an extended period of time. Here, we present a case report of a patient who presented to the emergency department with features suggestive of neuromuscular junction dysfunction, following exposure to imidacloprid. Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, has been used worldwide due to its selective toxicity for insects. Its residues may enter the food chain, which is why it is important to investigate the potential adverse effects of imidacloprid exposure. This review summarises current knowledge of the reproductive toxicity and disruptive endocrine effects of imidacloprid in laboratory animals. Investigations, conducted mostly on laboratory rats, have shown adverse effects of imidacloprid on the reproductive ability in both parental and offspring generation as well as on the development of the offspring. Like many pesticides, imidacloprid may also act as endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). It may disrupt the metabolic homeostasis, contribute to obesity, and disrupt steroidogenesis by inhibiting cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities. All these adverse effects of imidacloprid may pose a serious risk for reproduction and development with long-term consequences in adulthood.

270	5274-68-0	PUBMED	 We have studied the rheological properties of mixtures of polyoxyethylene (10 mol) phytosterol (PhyEO(10)) and polyoxyethylene (10 mol) cholesterol (ChEO(10)) mixed in different ratios along with tetraethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C(12)EO(4)) surfactants in water. Addition of C(12)EO(4) to the aqueous solution of a mixture of (PhyEO(10) + ChEO(10)) results in one-dimensional micellar growth and formation of viscoelastic solution of entangled wormlike micelles. Steady-shear rheological measurements show the Newtonian flow behavior at low shear-rate region and non-Newtonian flow behavior at higher shear-rate for viscous samples. The dynamic rheological data of the viscoelastic samples indicate the plateau modulus (G(o)) increases monotonically with C(12)EO(4) concentration and relaxation time (tau(R)) display a maximum at a composition corresponding to the viscosity maximum. The prepared viscoelastic sample in mixed nonionic surfactant systems has potential applications in cosmetic formulation. A systematic study of the diluted lamellar phases of the OG/C(12)E(4) system with different alkanols has been carried out by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The measurements have been made as a function of both the concentration and the alcohol type. Several different form factor models have been used to estimate the differences in bilayer topology induced by the presence of alcohol. For the infinite lamellae form factor (with a high-low-high electronic density profile across the membrane), there is a good fitting of samples with a X(OG) = 0.1 ratios. Only the free parameters correspond to the pseudomolecule composition and hydration number, which resulted in two water molecules per ethylene oxide group in the polar head irrespective of the alkanol chain length and concentration. However, samples with higher OG content can be quite well fitted by a core-shell disk model. For the samples with higher OG content, we find the participation of OG in the disks to be important. From the line-shape analysis of SAXS data, the half-thickness of the hydrophobic layer and the thickness of the hydrophilic layer have also been obtained. The results suggest significant mixing of the surfactant acyl chains corresponding to both sides of the lamellae and the transition from vesicles to open bilayer fragments without macroscopic phase separation.

We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. The phytohormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are major players in plant immunity. Numerous studies have provided evidence that SA- and JA-mediated signaling interact with each other (SA-JA crosstalk) to orchestrate plant immune responses against pathogens. At the same time, SA-JA crosstalk is often exploited by pathogens to promote their virulence. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of molecular mechanisms for and modulations of SA-JA crosstalk during pathogen infection. No information is available on the clinical use of glycolic acid (hydroxyacetic acid) on the skin during breastfeeding. Because it is unlikely to be appreciably absorbed or appear in breastmilk, it is considered safe to use during breastfeeding.[1,2] Avoid application to areas of the body that might come in direct contact with the infant's skin or where the drug might be ingested by the infant via licking.

283	Isofraxidin	WIKIPEDIA	"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of degenerative joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. It is believed to be the fourth leading cause of disability in the world, affecting 1 in 7 adults in the United States alone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Usually the symptoms progress slowly over years. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and, when the back is affected, weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are the two near the ends of the fingers and the joint at the base of the thumbs, the knee and hip joints, and the joints of the neck and lower back. The symptoms can interfere with work and normal daily activities. Unlike some other types of arthritis, only the joints, not internal organs, are affected. Causes include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have legs of different lengths, or have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests used to support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, in osteoarthritis the joints do not become hot or red. Treatment includes exercise, decreasing joint stress such as by rest or use of a cane, support groups, and pain medications. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is not recommended due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. Joint replacement surgery may be an option if there is ongoing disability despite other treatments. An artificial joint typically lasts 10 to 15 years. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting about 237 million people or 3.3% of the world's population, as of 2015. It becomes more common as people age. Among those over 60 years old, about 10% of males and 18% of females are affected. Osteoarthritis is the cause of about 2% of years lived with disability. == Signs and symptoms == The main symptom is pain, causing loss of ability and often stiffness. The pain is typically made worse by prolonged activity and relieved by rest. Stiffness is most common in the morning, and typically lasts less than thirty minutes after beginning daily activities, but may return after periods of inactivity. Osteoarthritis can cause a crackling noise (called ""crepitus"") when the affected joint is moved, especially shoulder and knee joint. A person may also complain of joint locking and joint instability. These symptoms would affect their daily activities due to pain and stiffness. Some people report increased pain associated with cold temperature, high humidity, or a drop in barometric pressure, but studies have had mixed results. Osteoarthritis commonly affects the hands, feet, spine, and the large weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees, although in theory, any joint in the body can be affected. As osteoarthritis progresses, movement patterns (such as gait), are typically affected. Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of a joint effusion of the knee. In smaller joints, such as at the fingers, hard bony enlargements, called Heberden's nodes (on the distal interphalangeal joints) or Bouchard's nodes (on the proximal interphalangeal joints), may form, and though they are not necessarily painful, they do limit the movement of the fingers significantly. Osteoarthritis of the toes may be a factor causing formation of bunions, rendering them red or swollen. == Causes == Damage from mechanical stress with insufficient self repair by joints is believed to be the primary cause of osteoarthritis. Sources of this stress may include misalignments of bones caused by congenital or pathogenic causes; mechanical injury; excess body weight; loss of strength in the muscles supporting a joint; and impairment of peripheral nerves, leading to sudden or uncoordinated movements. The risk of osteoarthritis increases with aging, history of joint injury, or family history of osteoarthritis. However exercise, including running in the absence of injury, has not been found to increase the risk of knee osteoarthritis. Nor has cracking one's knuckles been found to play a role. === Primary === The development of osteoarthritis is correlated with a history of previous joint injury and with obesity, especially with respect to knees. Changes in sex hormone levels may play a role in the development of osteoarthritis, as it is more prevalent among post-menopausal women than among men of the same age. Conflicting evidence exists for the differences in hip and knee osteoarthritis in African Americans and Caucasians. ==== Occupational ==== Increased risk of developing knee and hip osteoarthritis was found among those who work with manual handling (e.g. lifting), have physically demanding work, walk at work, and have climbing tasks at work (e.g. climb stairs or ladders). With hip osteoarthritis, in particular, increased risk of development over time was found among those who work in bent or twisted positions. For knee osteoarthritis, in particular, increased risk was found among those who work in a kneeling or squatting position, experience heavy lifting in combination with a kneeling or squatting posture, and work standing up. Women and men have similar occupational risks for the development of osteoarthritis. === Secondary === This type of osteoarthritis is caused by other factors but the resulting pathology is the same as for primary osteoarthritis: Alkaptonuria Congenital disorders of joints Diabetes doubles the risk of having a joint replacement due to osteoarthritis and people with diabetes have joint replacements at a younger age than those without diabetes. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease Inflammatory diseases (such as Perthes' disease), (Lyme disease), and all chronic forms of arthritis (e.g., costochondritis, gout, and rheumatoid arthritis). In gout, uric acid crystals cause the cartilage to degenerate at a faster pace. Injury to joints or ligaments (such as the ACL) as a result of an accident or orthopedic operations. Ligamentous deterioration or instability may be a factor. Marfan syndrome Obesity Joint infection == Pathophysiology == While osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that may cause gross cartilage loss and morphological damage to other joint tissues, more subtle biochemical changes occur in the earliest stages of osteoarthritis progression. The water content of healthy cartilage is finely balanced by compressive force driving water out and hydrostatic and osmotic pressure drawing water in. Collagen fibres exert the compressive force, whereas the Gibbs–Donnan effect and cartilage proteoglycans create osmotic pressure which tends to draw water in. However, during onset of osteoarthritis, the collagen matrix becomes more disorganized and there is a decrease in proteoglycan content within cartilage. The breakdown of collagen fibers results in a net increase in water content. This increase occurs because whilst there is an overall loss of proteoglycans (and thus a decreased osmotic pull), it is outweighed by a loss of collagen. Other structures within the joint can also be affected. The ligaments within the joint become thickened and fibrotic, and the menisci can become damaged and wear away. Menisci can be completely absent by the time a person undergoes a joint replacement. New bone outgrowths, called ""spurs"" or osteophytes, can form on the margins of the joints, possibly in an attempt to improve the congruence of the articular cartilage surfaces in the absence of the menisci. The subchondral bone volume increases and becomes less mineralized (hypo mineralization). All these changes can cause problems functioning. The pain in an osteoarthritic joint has been related to thickened synovium and to subchondral bone lesions. == Diagnosis == Diagnosis is made with reasonable certainty based on history and clinical examination. X-rays may confirm the diagnosis. The typical changes seen on X-ray include: joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis (increased bone formation around the joint), subchondral cyst formation, and osteophytes. Plain films may not correlate with the findings on physical examination or with the degree of pain. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology, using data from a multi-center study, developed a set of criteria for the diagnosis of hand osteoarthritis based on hard tissue enlargement and swelling of certain joints. These criteria were found to be 92% sensitive and 98% specific for hand osteoarthritis versus other entities such as rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathies. === Classification === A number of classification systems are used for gradation of osteoarthritis: WOMAC scale, taking into account pain, stiffness and functional limitation. Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale for osteoarthritis of the knee. It uses only projectional radiography features. Tönnis classification for osteoarthritis of the hip joint, also using only projectional radiography features. Both primary generalized nodal osteoarthritis and erosive osteoarthritis (EOA, also called inflammatory osteoarthritis) are sub-sets of primary osteoarthritis. EOA is a much less common, and more aggressive inflammatory form of osteoarthritis which often affects the distal interphalangeal joints of the hand and has characteristic articular erosive changes on X-ray. == Management == Lifestyle modification (such as weight loss and exercise) and pain medications are the mainstays of treatment. Acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) is recommended first line, with NSAIDs being used as add-on therapy only if pain relief is not sufficient. Medications that alter the course of the disease have not been found as of 2018. For overweight people, weight loss may help relieve pain due to hip arthritis. Recommendations include modification of risk factors through targeted interventions including 1) obesity and overweight, 2) physical activity, 3) dietary exposures, 4) comorbidities, 5) biomechanical factors, 6) occupational factors. Successful management of the condition is often made more difficult by differing priorities and poor communication between clinicians and people with osteoarthritis. Realistic treatment goals can be achieved by developing a shared understanding of the condition, actively listening to patient concerns, avoiding medical jargon and tailoring treatment plans to the patient's needs. === Exercise === Weight loss and exercise provide long-term treatment and are advocated in people with osteoarthritis. Weight loss and exercise are the most safe and effective long-term treatments, in contrast to short-term treatments which usually have risk of long-term harm. High impact exercise can increase the risk of joint injury, whereas low or moderate impact exercise, such as walking or swimming, is safer for people with osteoarthritis. A study has suggested that an increase in blood calcium levels had a positive impact on osteoarthritis. An adequate dietary calcium intake and regular weight-bearing exercise can increase calcium levels and is helpful in preventing osteoarthritis in the general population. There is also a weak protective effect factor of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. However, this is not recommended since an increase in LDL has an increased chance of cardiovascular comorbidities. Moderate exercise may be beneficial with respect to pain and function in those with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. These exercises should occur at least three times per week, under supervision, and focused on specific forms of exercise found to be most beneficial for this form of osteoarthritis. While some evidence supports certain physical therapies, evidence for a combined program is limited. Providing clear advice, making exercises enjoyable, and reassuring people about the importance of doing exercises may lead to greater benefit and more participation. Some evidence suggests that supervised exercise therapy may improve exercise adherence, although for knee osteoarthritis supervised exercise has shown the best results. === Physical measures === There is not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness of massage therapy. The evidence for manual therapy is inconclusive. A 2015 review indicated that aquatic therapy is safe, effective, and can be an adjunct therapy for knee osteoarthritis. Functional, gait, and balance training have been recommended to address impairments of position sense, balance, and strength in individuals with lower extremity arthritis, as these can contribute to a higher rate of falls in older individuals. For people with hand osteoarthritis, exercises may provide small benefits for improving hand function, reducing pain, and relieving finger joint stiffness. A study showed that there is low quality evidence that weak knee extensor muscle increased the chances of knee osteoarthritis. Strengthening of the knee extensors could possibly prevent knee osteoarthritis. Lateral wedge insoles and neutral insoles do not appear to be useful in osteoarthritis of the knee. Knee braces may help but their usefulness has also been disputed. For pain management, heat can be used to relieve stiffness, and cold can relieve muscle spasms and pain. Among people with hip and knee osteoarthritis, exercise in water may reduce pain and disability, and increase quality of life in the short term. Also therapeutic exercise programs such as aerobics and walking reduce pain and improve physical functioning for up to 6 months after the end of the program for people with knee osteoarthritis. In a study conducted over a period of 2 years on a group of individuals, a research team found that for every additional 1,000 steps per day, there was a 16% reduction in functional limitations in cases of knee osteoarthritis. Hydrotherapy might also be an advantage on the management of pain, disability and quality of life reported by people with osteoarthritis. === Thermotherapy === A 2003 Cochrane review of 7 studies between 1969 and 1999 found ice massage to be of significant benefit in improving range of motion and function, though not necessarily relief of pain. Cold packs could decrease swelling, but hot packs had no effect on swelling. Heat therapy could increase circulation, thereby reducing pain and stiffness, but with risk of inflammation and edema. === Medication === ==== By mouth ==== The pain medication paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the first line treatment for osteoarthritis. Pain relief does not differ according to dosage. However, a 2015 review found acetaminophen to have only a small short-term benefit with some concerns on abnormal results for liver function test. For mild to moderate symptoms effectiveness of acetaminophen is similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen, though for more severe symptoms NSAIDs may be more effective. NSAIDs are associated with greater side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Another class of NSAIDs, COX-2 selective inhibitors (such as celecoxib) are equally effective when compared to nonselective NSAIDs, and have lower rates of adverse gastrointestinal effects, but higher rates of cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction. They are also more expensive than non-specific NSAIDs. Benefits and risks vary in individuals and need consideration when making treatment decisions, and further unbiased research comparing NSAIDS and COX-2 selective inhibitors is needed. NSAIDS applied topically are effective for a small number of people. The COX-2 selective inhibitor rofecoxib was removed from the market in 2004, as cardiovascular events were associated with long term use. Education is helpful in self-management of arthritis, and can provide coping methods leading to about 20% more pain relief when compared to NSAIDs alone. Failure to achieve desired pain relief in osteoarthritis after two weeks should trigger reassessment of dosage and pain medication. Opioids by mouth, including both weak opioids such as tramadol and stronger opioids, are also often prescribed. Their appropriateness is uncertain, and opioids are often recommended only when first line therapies have failed or are contraindicated. This is due to their small benefit and relatively large risk of side effects. The use of tramadol likely does not improve pain or physical function and likely increases the incidence of adverse side effects. Oral steroids are not recommended in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Use of the antibiotic doxycycline orally for treating osteoarthritis is not associated with clinical improvements in function or joint pain. Any small benefit related to the potential for doxycycline therapy to address the narrowing of the joint space is not clear, and any benefit is outweighed by the potential harm from side effects. A 2018 meta-analysis found that oral collagen supplementation for the treatment of osteoarthritis reduces stiffness but does not improve pain and functional limitation. ==== Topical ==== There are several NSAIDs available for topical use, including diclofenac. A Cochrane review from 2016 concluded that reasonably reliable evidence is available only for use of topical diclofenac and ketoprofen in people aged over 40 years with painful knee arthritis. Transdermal opioid pain medications are not typically recommended in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The use of topical capsaicin to treat osteoarthritis is controversial, as some reviews found benefit while others did not. ==== Joint injections ==== Use of analgesia, intra-articular cortisone injection and consideration of hyaluronic acids and platelet-rich plasma are recommended for pain relief in people with knee osteoarthritis. Local drug delivery by intra-articular injection may be more effective and safer in terms of increased bioavailability, less systemic exposure and reduced adverse events. Several intra-articular medications for symptomatic treatment are available on the market as follows. ===== Steroids ===== Joint injection of glucocorticoids (such as hydrocortisone) leads to short-term pain relief that may last between a few weeks and a few months. A 2015 Cochrane review found that intra-articular corticosteroid injections of the knee did not benefit quality of life and had no effect on knee joint space; clinical effects one to six weeks after injection could not be determined clearly due to poor study quality. Another 2015 study reported negative effects of intra-articular corticosteroid injections at higher doses, and a 2017 trial showed reduction in cartilage thickness with intra-articular triamcinolone every 12 weeks for 2 years compared to placebo. A 2018 study found that intra-articular triamcinolone is associated with an increase in intraocular pressure. ===== Hyaluronic acid ===== Injections of hyaluronic acid have not produced improvement compared to placebo for knee arthritis, but did increase risk of further pain. In ankle osteoarthritis, evidence is unclear. ===== Platelet-rich plasma ===== The effectiveness of injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is unclear; there are suggestions that such injections improve function but not pain, and are associated with increased risk. A 2014 Cochrane review of studies involving PRP found the evidence to be insufficient. ===== Radiosynoviorthesis ===== Injection of beta particle-emitting radioisotopes (called radiosynoviorthesis) is used for the local treatment of inflammatory joint conditions. === Radiotherapy === Low-dose radiotherapy has been shown to improve pain and mobility of affected joints, primarily in extremities. It is approximately 70-90% effective, with minimal side effects. === Surgery === ==== Bone fusion ==== Arthrodesis (fusion) of the bones may be an option in some types of osteoarthritis. An example is ankle osteoarthritis, in which ankle fusion is considered to be the gold standard treatment in end-stage cases. ==== Joint replacement ==== If the impact of symptoms of osteoarthritis on quality of life is significant and more conservative management is ineffective, joint replacement surgery or resurfacing may be recommended. Evidence supports joint replacement for both knees and hips as it is both clinically effective and cost-effective. People who underwent total knee replacement had improved SF-12 quality of life scores, were feeling better compared to those who did not have surgery, and may have short- and long-term benefits for quality of life in terms of pain and function. The beneficial effects of these surgeries may be time-limited due to various environmental factors, comorbidities, and pain in other regions of the body. For people who have shoulder osteoarthritis and do not respond to medications, surgical options include a shoulder hemiarthroplasty (replacing a part of the joint), and total shoulder arthroplasty (replacing the joint). Biological joint replacement involves replacing the diseased tissues with new ones. This can either be from the person (autograft) or from a donor (allograft). People undergoing a joint transplant (osteochondral allograft) do not need to take immunosuppressants as bone and cartilage tissues have limited immune responses. Autologous articular cartilage transfer from a non-weight-bearing area to the damaged area, called osteochondral autograft transfer system, is one possible procedure that is being studied. When the missing cartilage is a focal defect, autologous chondrocyte implantation is also an option. ==== Shoulder replacement ==== For those with osteoarthritis in the shoulder, a complete shoulder replacement is sometimes suggested to improve pain and function. Demand for this treatment is expected to increase by 750% by the year 2030. There are different options for shoulder replacement surgeries, however, there is a lack of evidence in the form of high-quality randomized controlled trials, to determine which type of shoulder replacement surgery is most effective in different situations, what are the risks involved with different approaches, or how the procedure compares to other treatment options. There is some low-quality evidence that indicates that when comparing total shoulder arthroplasty over hemiarthroplasty, no large clinical benefit was detected in the short term. It is not clear if the risk of harm differs between total shoulder arthroplasty or a hemiarthroplasty approach. ==== Other surgical options ==== Osteotomy may be useful in people with knee osteoarthritis, but has not been well studied and it is unclear whether it is more effective than non-surgical treatments or other types of surgery. Arthroscopic surgery is largely not recommended, as it does not improve outcomes in knee osteoarthritis, and may result in harm. It is unclear whether surgery is beneficial in people with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. === Unverified treatments === ==== Glucosamine and chondroitin ==== The effectiveness of glucosamine is controversial. Reviews have found it to be equal to or slightly better than placebo. A difference may exist between glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride, with glucosamine sulfate showing a benefit and glucosamine hydrochloride not. The evidence for glucosamine sulfate having an effect on osteoarthritis progression is somewhat unclear and if present likely modest. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommends that glucosamine be discontinued if no effect is observed after six months and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence no longer recommends its use. Despite the difficulty in determining the efficacy of glucosamine, it remains a treatment option. The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) recommends glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate for knee osteoarthritis. Its use as a therapy for osteoarthritis is usually safe. A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials of chondroitin found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects; it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. ==== Supplements ==== Avocado–soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) is an extract made from avocado oil and soybean oil sold under many brand names worldwide as a dietary supplement and as a prescription drug in France. A 2014 Cochrane review found that while ASU might help relieve pain in the short term for some people with osteoarthritis, it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. The review noted a high-quality, two-year clinical trial comparing ASU to chondroitin – which has uncertain efficacy in osteoarthritis – with no difference between the two agents. The review also found there is insufficient evidence of ASU safety. A few high-quality studies of Boswellia serrata show consistent, but small, improvements in pain and function. Curcumin, phytodolor, and s-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) may be effective in improving pain. A 2009 Cochrane review recommended against the routine use of SAMe, as there has not been sufficient high-quality clinical research to prove its effect. A 2021 review found that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had no benefit in reducing pain and improving physical function in hand or knee osteoarthritis, and the off-label use of HCQ for people with osteoarthritis should be discouraged. There is no evidence for the use of colchicine for treating the pain of hand or knee arthritis. There is limited evidence to support the use of hyaluronan, methylsulfonylmethane, rose hip, capsaicin, or vitamin D. ==== Acupuncture and other interventions ==== While acupuncture leads to improvements in pain relief, this improvement is small and may be of questionable importance. Waiting list–controlled trials for peripheral joint osteoarthritis do show clinically relevant benefits, but these may be due to placebo effects. Acupuncture does not seem to produce long-term benefits. Electrostimulation techniques such as TENS have been used for twenty years to treat osteoarthritis in the knee. However, there is no conclusive evidence to show that it reduces pain or disability. A Cochrane review of low-level laser therapy found unclear evidence of benefit, whereas another review found short-term pain relief for osteoarthritic knees. Further research is needed to determine if balnotherapy for osteoarthritis (mineral baths or spa treatments) improves a person's quality of life or ability to function. The use of ice or cold packs may be beneficial; however, further research is needed. There is no evidence of benefit from placing hot packs on joints. There is low quality evidence that therapeutic ultrasound may be beneficial for people with osteoarthritis of the knee; however, further research is needed to confirm and determine the degree and significance of this potential benefit. Therapeutic ultrasound is safe and helps reducing pain and improving physical function for knee osteoarthritis. While phonophoresis does not improve functions, it may offer greater pain relief than standard non-drug ultrasound. Continuous and pulsed ultrasound modes (especially 1 MHz, 2.5 W/cm2, 15min/ session, 3 session/ week, during 8 weeks protocol) may be effective in improving patients physical function and pain. There is weak evidence suggesting that electromagnetic field treatment may result in moderate pain relief; however, further research is necessary and it is not known if electromagnetic field treatment can improve quality of life or function. Viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of the knee may have positive effects on pain and function at 5 to 13 weeks post-injection. == Epidemiology == Globally, as of 2010, approximately 250 million people had osteoarthritis of the knee (3.6% of the population). Hip osteoarthritis affects about 0.85% of the population. As of 2004, osteoarthritis globally causes moderate to severe disability in 43.4 million people. Together, knee and hip osteoarthritis had a ranking for disability globally of 11th among 291 disease conditions assessed. === Middle East and North Africa (MENA) === In the Middle East and North Africa from 1990 to 2019, the prevalence of people with hip osteoarthritis increased three–fold over the three decades, a total of 1.28 million cases. It increased 2.88-fold, from 6.16 million cases to 17.75 million, between 1990 and 2019 for knee osteoarthritis. Hand osteoarthritis in MENA also increased 2.7-fold, from 1.6 million cases to 4.3 million from 1990 to 2019. === United States === As of 2012, osteoarthritis affected 52.5 million people in the United States, approximately 50% of whom were 65 years or older. It is estimated that 80% of the population have radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis by age 65, although only 60% of those will have symptoms. The rate of osteoarthritis in the United States is forecast to be 78 million (26%) adults by 2040. In the United States, there were approximately 964,000 hospitalizations for osteoarthritis in 2011, a rate of 31 stays per 10,000 population. With an aggregate cost of $14.8 billion ($15,400 per stay), it was the second-most expensive condition seen in US hospital stays in 2011. By payer, it was the second-most costly condition billed to Medicare and private insurance. === Europe === In Europe, the number of individuals affected by osteoarthritis has increased from 27.9 million in 1990 to 50.8 million in 2019. Hand osteoarthritis was the second most prevalent type, affecting an estimated 12.5 million people. In 2019, Knee osteoarthritis was the 18th most common cause of years lived with disability (YLDs) in Europe, accounting for 1.28% of all YLDs. This has increased from 1.12% in 1990. === India === In India, the number of individuals affected by osteoarthritis has increased from 23.46 million in 1990 to 62.35 million in 2019. Knee osteoarthritis was the most prevalent type of osteoarthritis, followed by hand osteoarthritis. In 2019, osteoarthritis was the 20th most common cause of years lived with disability (YLDs) in India, accounting for 1.48% of all YLDs, which increased from 1.25% and 23rd most common cause in 1990. == History == === Etymology === Osteoarthritis is derived from the prefix osteo- (from Ancient Greek: ὀστέον, romanized: ostéon, lit. 'bone') combined with arthritis (from ἀρθρῖτῐς, arthrîtis, lit. ''of or in the joint''), which is itself derived from arthr- (from ἄρθρον, árthron, lit. ''joint, limb'') and -itis (from -ῖτις, -îtis, lit. ''pertaining to''), the latter suffix having come to be associated with inflammation. The -itis of osteoarthritis could be considered misleading as inflammation is not a conspicuous feature. Some clinicians refer to this condition as osteoarthrosis to signify the lack of inflammatory response, the suffix -osis (from -ωσις, -ōsis, lit. ''(abnormal) state, condition, or action'') simply referring to the pathosis itself. == Other animals == Osteoarthritis has been reported in several species of animals all over the world, including marine animals and even some fossils; including but not limited to: cats, many rodents, cattle, deer, rabbits, sheep, camels, elephants, buffalo, hyena, lions, mules, pigs, tigers, kangaroos, dolphins, dugong, and horses. Osteoarthritis has been reported in fossils of the large carnivorous dinosaur Allosaurus fragilis. == Research == === Therapies === Pharmaceutical agents that will alter the natural history of disease progression by arresting joint structural change and ameliorating symptoms are termed as disease modifying therapy. Therapies under investigation include the following: Strontium ranelate – may decrease degeneration in osteoarthritis and improve outcomes Gene therapy – Gene transfer strategies aim to target the disease process rather than the symptoms. Cell-mediated gene therapy is also being studied. One version was approved in South Korea for the treatment of moderate knee osteoarthritis, but later revoked for the mislabeling and the false reporting of an ingredient used. The drug was administered intra-articularly. === Cause === As well as attempting to find disease-modifying agents for osteoarthritis, there is emerging evidence that a system-based approach is necessary to find the causes of osteoarthritis. A study conducted by scientists at the University of Twente found that osmolarity induced intracellular molecular crowding might drive the disease pathology. === Diagnostic biomarkers === Guidelines outlining requirements for inclusion of soluble biomarkers in osteoarthritis clinical trials were published in 2015, but there are no validated biomarkers used clinically to detect osteoarthritis, as of 2021. A 2015 systematic review of biomarkers for osteoarthritis looking for molecules that could be used for risk assessments found 37 different biochemical markers of bone and cartilage turnover in 25 publications. The strongest evidence was for urinary C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen (uCTX-II) as a prognostic marker for knee osteoarthritis progression, and serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) levels as a prognostic marker for incidence of both knee and hip osteoarthritis. A review of biomarkers in hip osteoarthritis also found associations with uCTX-II.

301	Palmitoylglutamic acid	PUBMED	 Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

314	Lauroyl d-arginate	PUBMED	 Here we study the effect of monohydrochloride of L-arginine, N(alpha)-lauroyl ethylester (LAE), a cationic preservative derived from lauric acid and arginine, on the cell envelopes of Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus at sub-lethal concentration such as their respective minimal inhibitory concentrations, 32 and 8 microg ml(-1), respectively. Bacterial populations were studied by using transmission electron and fluorescence microscopy (TEM and FM), flow cytometry (FC) and ion-flux across the cellular membrane. Cell integrity was altered mainly in the outer membrane of S. typhimurium, but there was no significant change in the cytoplasm. However, in Staph. aureus, clear zones, abnormal septation and mesosome-like structures were observed in the cytoplasm. Bacterial populations were double-stained with propidium iodide (PI) and SYTO-13 for FC analysis. In S. typhimurium the proportion of damaged cells after 24 h was 97% and in Staph. aureus 56.3%. LAE induced transmembrane ion flux, the increase of potassium leakage after 30 min of contact was 7.7 and 3.34 microg ml(-1) for Staph. aureus and S. typhimurium, respectively. Membrane disruption was detected by measuring the proton flow across the membrane. Disturbance in membrane potential and structural changes was caused by LAE, although cells were not disrupted. This is the first time the cellular effects of LAE on bacterial cells were studied.

Ursolic acid inhibited abdominal constriction in a dose-dependent manner, and the result obtained at a content of 40 mg kg(-1) was similar to that produced by administration of acetylsalicylic acid at a content of 100 mg kg(-1). Both acids reduced the number of paw licks in the second phase of the formalin test, and both of them displayed a significant anti-inflammatory effect at a content of 40 mg kg(-1). It is noteworthy that the administration of the isolated mixture, containing 65% ursolic acid/35% oleanolic acid, did not display significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. On the basis of the obtained results, considering that the mixture of UA and OA was poorly active, it is suggested that other compounds, rather than UA and OA, should be responsible for the evaluated activities in the crude extract, since the crude extract samples displayed good activities. To optimize the synthetic pathway and fermentation process of yeast cell factories for production of oleanoic acid. Using the DNA assembler method, one copy of Glycyrrhiza glabra beta-amyrin synthase (GgbAS), Medicago truncatula oleanolic acid synthase (MtOAS) and Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome P450 reductase 1 (AtCPR1) genes were introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY-OA, resulting in strain BY-20A. YPD medium with different glucose concentration were then used to cultivate strain BY-2OA. Increasing gene copies of GgbAS, MtOAS and AtCPR1 resulted in increased beta-amyrin and oleanolic acid production. The strain BY-2OA produced 136.5 mg x L(-1) beta-amyrin and 92.5 mg x L(-1) oleanolic acid, which were 54% and 30% higher than the parent strain BY-OA. Finally, the titer of oleanolic acid increased to 165.7 mg x L(-1) when cultivated in YPD medium with 40 mg x L(-1) glucose. Production of oleanoic acid increased significantly in the yeast strain BY-2OA, which can provide the basis for creating an alternative way for production of oleanoic acid in place of extraction from plant sources. Glycosylations of 3-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)- 3,4-di-O-acetyl-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl)-23-O-acetylhederageni n (15) with mono- (16), di- (17) and trisaccharide bromide (18) gave the bisdesmoside peracetates 19, 20 and 22, respectively, which were treated with 5% KOH in MeOH to give the bisdesmosides 25-27. Hydrolysis of the glycosides 6 and 9 having beta-D-glucopyranose as a terminal sugar component with beta-glucosidase in acetate buffer (pH 4.7) gave compounds 28 and 29, respectively. Cytoprotective effects of the synthesized triterpenoidal saponins against CCl4-induced hepatic injury were compared with those of saponins isolated from the leaves of Aralia elata Seem. (Araliaceae) using isolated hepatocytes from rat liver. Although the monodesmosides 1-4 having neutral sugar components only at the O-3 position on the aglycones showed no cytoprotective effect, bisdesmosides having sugar components at both the O-3 and O-28 positions on the aglycones had potent effects, even when the species of the sugar components were different. The bisdesmosides 10, 11, and 27 having five monosaccharides in the molecules exhibited the most potent cytoprotective effects.	MEDICAL, FOOD	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.4879462, 'ICAL': 0.0}

351	11,17,21-trihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione	WIKIPEDIA	"Prednisolone is a corticosteroid, a steroid hormone used to treat certain types of allergies, inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disorders, and cancers, electrolyte imbalances and skin conditions. Some of these conditions include adrenocortical insufficiency, high blood calcium, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, eye inflammation, asthma, multiple sclerosis, and phimosis. It can be taken by mouth, injected into a vein, used topically as a skin cream, or as eye drops. It differs from the similarly named prednisone in having a hydroxyl at the 11th carbon instead of a ketone. Common side effects with short-term use include nausea, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, increased appetite, and fatigue. More severe side effects include psychiatric problems, which may occur in about 5% of people. Common side effects with long-term use include bone loss, weakness, yeast infections, and easy bruising. While short-term use in the later part of pregnancy is safe, long-term use or use in early pregnancy is occasionally associated with harm to the baby. It is a glucocorticoid made from hydrocortisone (cortisol). Prednisolone was discovered and approved for medical use in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic drug. In 2022, it was the 136th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == When used in low doses, corticosteroids serve as an anti-inflammatory agent. At higher doses, they are considered as immunosuppressants. Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and, it is presumed, delay or slow healing. They inhibit edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. === Systemic use === Prednisolone is a corticosteroid drug with predominant glucocorticoid and low mineralocorticoid activity, making it useful for the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions such as asthma, uveitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, rheumatoid arthritis, urticaria, angioedema, ulcerative colitis, pericarditis, temporal arteritis, Crohn's disease, Bell's palsy, multiple sclerosis, cluster headaches, vasculitis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, autoimmune hepatitis, lupus, Kawasaki disease, dermatomyositis, post-myocardial infarction syndrome, and sarcoidosis. Prednisolone can also be used for allergic reactions ranging from seasonal allergies to drug allergic reactions. Prednisolone can also be used as an immunosuppressant for organ transplants. Prednisolone in lower doses can be used in cases of adrenal insufficiency due to Addison's disease. === Topical use === Ophthalmology Topical prednisolone is mainly used in the ophthalmic pathway as eye drops in numerous eye conditions, including corneal injuries caused by chemicals, burns, and alien objects, inflammation of the eyes, mild to moderate non-infectious allergies, disorders of the eyelid, conjunctiva or sclera, ocular inflammation caused by operation and optic neuritis. Some side effects include glaucoma, blurred vision, eye discomfort, impaired recovery of injured site, scarring of the optic nerve, cataracts, and urticaria. However, their prevalence is not known. Prednisolone eye drops are contraindicated in individuals who develop hypersensitivity reactions against prednisolone, or individuals with the current conditions, such as tuberculosis of the eye, shingles affecting the eye, raised intraocular pressure, and eye infection caused by fungus. Prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension (eye drops) is prepared as a sterile ophthalmic suspension and used to reduce swelling, redness, itching, and allergic reactions affecting the eye. It has been explored as a treatment option for bacterial keratitis. Prednisolone eye drops are used in conjunctivitis caused by allergies and bacteria, marginal keratitis, uveitis, endophthalmitis, which is an infection of the eye involving the aqueous humor, Graves' ophthalmopathy, herpes zoster ocular infection, inflammation of the eye after surgery, and corneal injuries caused by chemicals, radiation, thermal burns, or penetration of foreign objects. It is also used in the prevention of myringosclerosis, herpes simplex stromal keratitis. Topical prednisolone can also be used after procedures such as Laser Peripheral Iridotomy for patients with primary angle-closure suspects (PACS) to control inflammations. Ear drops In addition, topical prednisolone can also be administered as ear drops. == Adverse effects == Adverse reactions from the use of prednisolone include: Increased appetite, weight gain, nausea, and malaise Increased risk of infection Cardiovascular events Dermatological effects including reddening of the face, bruising/skin discoloration, impaired wound healing, skin atrophy, skin rash, edema, and abnormal hair growth Hyperglycemia; patients with diabetes may need increased insulin or diabetic therapies Menstrual abnormalities Lower response to hormones, especially during stressful instances such as surgery or illness Change in electrolytes: rise in blood pressure, increased sodium and low potassium, leading to alkalosis Gastrointestinal system effects: swelling of the stomach lining, reversible increase in liver enzymes, and risk of stomach ulcers Muscular and skeletal abnormalities, such as muscle weakness/muscle loss, osteoporosis (see steroid-induced osteoporosis), long bone fractures, tendon rupture, and back fractures Neurological effects, including involuntary movements (convulsions), headaches, and vertigo Psychosocial behavioral and emotional disturbances with aggression being one of the most common cognitive symptoms, especially with oral use. Nasal septum perforation and bowel perforation (in some pathologic conditions). Discontinuing prednisolone after long-term or high-dose use can lead to adrenal insufficiency. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Although there are no major human studies of prednisolone use in pregnant women, studies in several animals show that it may cause birth defects including increased likelihood of cleft palate. Prednisolone is found in the breast milk of mothers taking prednisolone. === Local adverse effects in the eye === When used topically on the eye, the following are potential side effects: Cataracts: Extended usage of corticosteroids may cause clouding at the back of the lens, also known as posterior subcapsular cataract. This type of cataract reduces the path of light from reaching the eye, which interferes with a person's reading vision. Consumption of prednisolone eye drops post-surgery may also retard the healing process. Corneal thinning: When corticosteroids are used in the long term, corneal and scleral thinning is also one of its consequences. When not ceased, thinning may ultimately lead to perforation of the cornea. Glaucoma: Elongated use of corticosteroids has a chance of causing a raised intraocular pressure (IOP), injuring the optic nerve, and weakening visual awareness. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with concomitant conditions of glaucoma. Doctors track patients' IOP if they are using corticosteroid eye drops for more than 103 days. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === As a glucocorticoid, the lipophilic structure of prednisolone allows for easy passage through the cell membrane where it then binds to its respective glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) located in the cytoplasm. Upon binding, the formation of the GC/GCR complex causes dissociation of chaperone proteins from the glucocorticoid receptor enabling the GC/GCR complex to translocate inside the nucleus. This process occurs within 20 minutes of binding. Once inside the nucleus, the homodimer GC/GCR complex binds to specific DNA binding sites known as glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) resulting in gene expression or inhibition. Complex binding to positive GREs leads to the synthesis of anti-inflammatory proteins while binding to negative GREs blocks the transcription of inflammatory genes. They inhibit the release of signals that promote inflammation such as nuclear factor-Kappa B (NF-κB), Activator protein 1 (AP-1), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), and stimulate anti-inflammatory signals such as the interleukin-10 gene. All of them will collectively cause a sequence of events, including the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and additional inflammatory mediators. Glucocorticoids also inhibit neutrophil cell death and demargination. As well as phospholipase A2, which in turn lessens arachidonic acid derivative genesis. === Pharmacokinetics === Prednisolone has a relatively short half-life, ranging 2–4 hours. It also has a large therapeutic window, considering the dosage required to produce a therapeutic effect is a few times higher than what the body naturally produces. Prednisolone is 70–90% plasma protein bound, it binds to proteins such as albumin. Both prednisolone phosphate and prednisolone acetate go through ester hydrolysis in the body to form prednisolone. It subsequently undergoes the usual metabolism of prednisolone. Concomitant use of prednisolone and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole is shown to cause a rise in plasma prednisolone concentrations by about 50% owing to a diminished clearance. Prednisolone predominantly undergoes kidney elimination and is excreted in the urine as sulphate and metabolites of glucuronide conjugate. === Prednisone === Prednisone is a prodrug that is activated in the liver. When it enters the body, prednisone is triggered by the liver and body chemicals to turn into its active form, prednisolone. == Chemistry == Prednisolone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid closely related to its cognate prednisone, having identical structure save for two fewer hydrogens near C11. It is also known as δ1-cortisol, δ1-hydrocortisone, 1,2-dehydrocortisol, or 1,2-dehydrohydrocortisone, as well as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione. == Interactions == Co-administration of prednisolone eye drops with ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may perhaps exacerbate its effects, causing unwanted side effects such as toxicity. The wound healing process may also be hindered. Drug interactions of prednisolone include other immunosuppressants like azathioprine or ciclosporin, antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel, anticoagulants like dabigatran or warfarin, or NSAIDs such as aspirin, celecoxib, or ibuprofen. == Contraindications == == Special populations == === Children === Prolonged use of prednisolone eye drops in children may lead to raised intraocular pressure. While this phenomenon is dose-dependent, it is shown to have a greater effect, especially in children under 6 years of age. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Research on animal reproduction has indicated that there is a trace of teratogenicity when doses are reduced by 10 times the human recommended dose. There is no sufficient information on human pregnancy at this moment. Use is only recommended when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks for the pregnant mother and the fetus. Prednisolone when delivered systemically can be found in the mother's breast milk, however, there is no data provided for the extent of prednisolone found in the system after administering eye drops. However, the presence of corticosteroids is recorded when they are administered systemically, and it could affect the fetus' growth. Therefore, the use of prednisolone during breastfeeding is not advocated. == Society and culture == === Dosage forms === Prednisolone is supplied as oral liquid, oral suspension, oral syrup, oral tablet, and oral disintegrating tablet. It may be a generic medication or supplied as brands Flo-Pred (prednisolone acetate oral suspension), Millipred (oral tablets), Orapred (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral dissolving tablets), Pediapred (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution), Veripred 20, Prelone, Hydeltra-T.B.A., Hydeltrasol, Key-Pred, Cotolone, Predicort, Medicort, Predcor, Bubbli-Pred, Omnipred (prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension), Pred Mild, Pred Forte, and others. === Athletics === As a glucocorticosteroid, unauthorized or ad hoc use of prednisolone during competition via oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or rectal routes is banned under World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) anti-doping rules. == Veterinary uses == Prednisolone is used in the treatment of inflammatory and allergic conditions in cats, dogs, horses, small mammals such as ferrets, birds, and reptiles. Its usage in treating inflammation, immune-mediated disease, Addison's disease, and neoplasia is often considered off-label use. Many drugs are commonly prescribed for off-label use in veterinary medicine."" Studies in ruminating species, such as alpacas, have shown that oral administration of the drug is associated with a reduced bioavailability compared to intravenous administration; however, levels that are therapeutic in other species can be achieved with oral administration in alpacas. It is used in a broad spectrum of diseases, for example, inflammation of scleral tissues, cornea, and conjunctiva in dogs. In horses, prednisolone acetate suspensions are priorly used to treat inflammation in the middle layer of the eye, also known as anterior uveitis and equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), which is the leading cause of visual impairment in horses. Prednisolone acetate eye drops are not to be used in other animals such as birds. Prednisolone acetate eye drops are also prescribed to dogs and cats to lessen swelling, redness, burning, and pain sensations after surgeries of the eye. Cats with conjunctivitis usually are required to avoid using ophthalmic preparations of corticosteroids and its derivatives. The most typical infections are caused by herpes virus. == References == == External links == ""Prednisolone Ophthalmic"". MedlinePlus.

366	3179-80-4	PUBMED	 The cationic emulsifier oleamidopropyl dimethylamine has been responsible for many cases of cosmetic sensitisation in The Netherlands. Of 119 patients with proven cosmetic-related allergic contact dermatitis, 13 (11%) were allergic to oleamidopropyl dimethylamine. The clinical data of 12 patients, all sensitised by one particular baby body lotion containing 0.3% of the emulsifier, are presented. The cross-reaction pattern of oleamidopropyl dimethylamine was investigated by patch testing 13 patients allergic to the emulsifier with a series of related amideamine type emulsifiers. Most cross-reactions were observed to ricinoleamidopropyl dimethylamine lactate and tallowamidopropyl dimethylamine (11 patients, 85%). 9 patients (of 12 tested: 75%) reacted to lauramidopropyl dimethylamine and 6 (46%) to myristamidopropyl dimethylamine. It is concluded that the presence of oleamidopropyl dimethylamine in a concentration of 0.3% in stay-on cosmetics, especially when applied to damaged skin and/or the periorbital area, bears a definite risk of the induction and elicitation of contact allergic reactions. 13 patients allergic to the cationic emulsifier oleamidopropyl dimethylamine were tested with a series of related amide-amine type surfactants in order to investigate its cross-reaction pattern. With 1 exception, all patients reacted to at least 4 of the test materials. Most reactions were observed to ricinoleamidopropyl dimethylamine lactate and tallowamidopropyl dimethylamine (11 patients, 85%); 9 patients (of 12 tested, 75%) reacted to lauramidopropyl dimethylamine and 6 (46%) to myristamidopropyl dimethylamine. A certain pattern of cross-reactivity was recognised.	PERSONAL CARE	PERSONAL CARE	{'PERSON': -5.2047206e-05, 'AL': 0.0, ' CARE': 0.0}
373	28374-89-2	PUBMED	 Hop-derived compounds have been subjected to numerous biomedical studies investigating their impact on a wide range of pathologies. Isomerised bitter acids (isoadhumulone, isocohumulone and isohumulone) from hops, used in the brewing process of beer, are known to inhibit members of the aldo-keto-reductase superfamily. Aldo-keto-reductase 1B10 (AKR1B10) is upregulated in various types of cancer and has been reported to promote carcinogenesis. Inhibition of AKR1B10 appears to be an attractive means to specifically treat RAS-dependent malignancies. However, the closely related reductases AKR1A1 and AKR1B1, which fulfil important roles in the detoxification of endogenous and xenobiotic carbonyl compounds oftentimes crossreact with inhibitors designed to target AKR1B10. Accordingly, there is an ongoing search for selective AKR1B10 inhibitors that do not interact with endogeneous AKR1A1 and AKR1B1-driven detoxification systems.

399	3089-11-0	WIKIPEDIA	Hexa(methoxymethyl)melamine (HMMM) is a hemiaminal ether commonly used as a crosslinking agent in the production of coatings and rubber items. It is produced via the reaction of melamine with formaldehyde and excess methanol, with the later also acting as a solvent for the reaction. It can be considered as a monomeric intermediate in the formation of melamine resin. Hexamethoxymethylmelamine is used along with resorcinol in the production of vehicle tires, where it improves adhesion between the rubber and the steel reinforcing cords. As it has some water solubility it slowly leaches out of the rubber; particularly from the particles formed as the tires wear-down through use. Road runoff then introduces it into urban waters, where it has become a contaminant of emerging concern. == See also == Rubber pollution == References ==	INDUSTRIAL	INDUSTRIAL	{'IND': -1.9361265e-07, 'UST': 0.0, 'RI': -1.504853e-06, 'AL': 0.0}

419	35054-69-4	PUBMED	 Fatty acid amides, such as n-lauroyl-L-alanine, gelate both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents efficiently. In addition this compound is found to gelate the binary solvent mixtures comprised of aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g., toluene and aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g., n-heptane. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy show that the fiber thickness of the gel assembly increases progressively in the binary mixture of n-heptane and toluene with increasing percentage of toluene. The self-assembly patterns of the gels in individual solvents, n-heptane and toluene, are however different. The toluene gel consists of predominantly one type of morphological species, while n-heptane gel has more than one species leading to the polymorphic nature of the gel. The n-heptane gel is thermally more stable than the toluene gel as evident from the measurement using differential scanning calorimetry. The thermal stability of the gels prepared in the binary mixture of n-heptane and toluene is dependent on the composition of solvent mixture. Rheology of the gels shows that they are shear-thinning material and show characteristic behavior of soft viscoelastic solid. For the gels prepared from binary solvent mixture of toluene and n-heptane, with incorporation of more toluene in the binary mixture, the gel becomes a more viscoelastic solid. The time sweep rheology experiment demonstrates that the gel made in n-heptane has faster gel formation kinetics than that prepared in toluene. To characterize novel pharmaceutical organogels based on the self-assembly of L-alanine derivatives in hydrophobic vehicles. The gelation properties of N-lauroyl-L-alanine (LA) and N-lauroyl-L-alanine methyl ester (LAM) were investigated in the presence of various solvents. Gel-sol and sol-gel transitions were evaluated by the inverse flow method, and gelation kinetics were determined by turbidimetry. The in vitro release kinetics of labeled dextran physically dispersed in the oil-based organogel was assessed in phosphate-buffered saline. In situ formation of the implants was evaluated in rats by subcutaneously injecting a solution containing LAM, an oil, and a water-diffusible inhibitor of self-assembly (ethanol). The LAM-containing formulations showed a hysteretic gelling behavior with transition temperatures between 10 and 55 degrees C. Gelation kinetics exhibited a lag time of 10 and 30 min at 25 and 37 degrees C, respectively. In vitro, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran was released from the gel in a sustained manner with less than 6% released after 20 days. The addition of ethanol to the LAM/oil mixture inhibited gelation and allowed subcutaneous injection of the solution at room temperature. After injection, ethanol diffusion led to the formation of a solid implant. Low-molecular weight self-assembling organogelators may allow the preparation of novel in situ-forming hydrophobic implants. In this research, hexagonal and cubic mesoporous silica with ordered parallel pore channels was synthesized using odd chain-length N-undecanoyl-L-alanine sodium salt and even chain-length N-lauroyl-L-alanine sodium salt as template respectively. Aminopropylsiloxane was used as the co-structure-directing agents (CSDA). The ordered mesostructure was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, small X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), trasmission electron microscope (TEM), and nitrogen sorption analysis. The results indicated that mesoporous silica which was prepared by asymmetric odd chain-length surfactants presented a looser strucuture with large volume than mesoporous silica prepared by the even chain-length surfactant. It led to the transformation from 2D hexagonal (p6mm) phase to cubic (Ia¯3d) mesophase.	MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE	MEDICAL	{'MED': -0.00936006, 'ICAL': 0.0}

423	Alpha-muricholic acid	PUBMED	 Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient necessary for various metabolic functions within the body. This essential vitamin participates in energy generation, synthesizing hormones, and maintaining optimal conditions for skin, hair, and nails. Supplemental vitamin B5 is employed to address and mitigate nutrient deficiencies. This activity discusses the mechanisms of action, adverse event profile, off-label applications, appropriate dosing strategies, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring procedures, and relevant interactions of vitamin B5. Participants gain insights and knowledge essential for managing cases involving nutritional deficiencies and related conditions. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

441	29554-26-5	PUBMED	 Despite its critical role in repelling damaging insects, our understanding of nonhost resistance against herbivores remains very limited. Recently, Bai et al. identified a novel caffeoylputrescine-green leaf volatile (GLV) compound in wild tobacco plants that confers nonhost resistance to Empoasca leafhoppers through high-throughput multi-omics analyses. The Rhizobium rhizogene-transformed root culture from Physalis peruviana L. (P. peruviana) may be a promising and novel source of valuable phenolics, including caffeoylputrescine (CP), which is known for antioxidant, antidiabetic, insect-resistant, disease-resistant, and neuroprotective properties. In this study, to improve the production efficiency of phytochemical components in P. peruviana hairy root cultures, we optimized various culture conditions, including the inoculum size, liquid volume, culture media type, carbon source, sucrose concentration, initial pH, and application of elicitors, to enhance the total phenolic content and CP yield in these hairy root cultures. The findings indicate that the use of sucrose as carbon source resulted in the highest biomass (13.28 g DW/L), total phenolic content (6.26 mg/g), and CP yield (2.40 mg/L). The White medium excelled in enhancing the total phenolic content (9.35 mg/g), whereas the B5 medium was most effective for the biomass (13.38 g DW/L) and CP yield (6.30 mg/L). A sucrose concentration of 5% was best for the biomass (18.40 g DW/L), whereas a sucrose concentration of 4% was ideal for the CP yield. Optimal culture conditions were as follows: an inoculum size of 0.5 g/100 mL, a liquid volume of 100 mL in a 250-mL flask, B5 medium, 4% sucrose, and a pH of 5.5. Among the tested elicitors, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) at 100 µM significantly increased the biomass (21.3 g/L), total phenolic content (23.34 mg/g), and CP yield (141.10 mg/L), which represent 0.96-, 2.12-, and 13.04-fold increases, respectively, over the control after 8 days. The optimized HR culture of P. peruviana provides a promising system to enhance the production of CP for pharmaceutical applications. A new hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:putrescine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (PHT) was detected in two variant lines of Nicotiana tabacum L. (TX1, TX4) accumulating markedly different levels of caffeoylputrescine. The enzyme accepted only the aliphatic diamines putrescine, cadaverine and 1,3-diaminopropane at a ratio of 100:33:8. Caffeoyl- and feruloyl-CoAs were the best acyl donors. The apparent K(m)-values for caffeoyl-CoA and putrescine were near 3 and 10 micromolar, respectively, at the pH-optimum of 10.0. PHT activity was quite similar in low producing TX1 and high producing TX4 cells, while some other biosynthetic enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, ornithine decarboxylase) were greatly enhanced in TX4 cells, suggesting that PHT does not catalyze the rate-limiting step in hydroxycinnamoylputrescine formation.

464	3-hydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid	PUBMED	 The aim of this work was to use in vivo models to evaluate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of ursolic acid (UA) and oleanoic acid (OA), the major compounds isolated as an isomeric mixture from the crude methylene chloride extract of Miconia albicans aerial parts in an attempt to clarify if these compounds are responsible for the analgesic properties displayed by this plant. Ursolic acid inhibited abdominal constriction in a dose-dependent manner, and the result obtained at a content of 40 mg kg(-1) was similar to that produced by administration of acetylsalicylic acid at a content of 100 mg kg(-1). Both acids reduced the number of paw licks in the second phase of the formalin test, and both of them displayed a significant anti-inflammatory effect at a content of 40 mg kg(-1). It is noteworthy that the administration of the isolated mixture, containing 65% ursolic acid/35% oleanolic acid, did not display significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. On the basis of the obtained results, considering that the mixture of UA and OA was poorly active, it is suggested that other compounds, rather than UA and OA, should be responsible for the evaluated activities in the crude extract, since the crude extract samples displayed good activities. To optimize the synthetic pathway and fermentation process of yeast cell factories for production of oleanoic acid. Using the DNA assembler method, one copy of Glycyrrhiza glabra beta-amyrin synthase (GgbAS), Medicago truncatula oleanolic acid synthase (MtOAS) and Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome P450 reductase 1 (AtCPR1) genes were introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY-OA, resulting in strain BY-20A. YPD medium with different glucose concentration were then used to cultivate strain BY-2OA. Increasing gene copies of GgbAS, MtOAS and AtCPR1 resulted in increased beta-amyrin and oleanolic acid production. The strain BY-2OA produced 136.5 mg x L(-1) beta-amyrin and 92.5 mg x L(-1) oleanolic acid, which were 54% and 30% higher than the parent strain BY-OA. Finally, the titer of oleanolic acid increased to 165.7 mg x L(-1) when cultivated in YPD medium with 40 mg x L(-1) glucose. Production of oleanoic acid increased significantly in the yeast strain BY-2OA, which can provide the basis for creating an alternative way for production of oleanoic acid in place of extraction from plant sources. Glycosylations of 3-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)- 3,4-di-O-acetyl-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl)-23-O-acetylhederageni n (15) with mono- (16), di- (17) and trisaccharide bromide (18) gave the bisdesmoside peracetates 19, 20 and 22, respectively, which were treated with 5% KOH in MeOH to give the bisdesmosides 25-27. Hydrolysis of the glycosides 6 and 9 having beta-D-glucopyranose as a terminal sugar component with beta-glucosidase in acetate buffer (pH 4.7) gave compounds 28 and 29, respectively. Cytoprotective effects of the synthesized triterpenoidal saponins against CCl4-induced hepatic injury were compared with those of saponins isolated from the leaves of Aralia elata Seem. (Araliaceae) using isolated hepatocytes from rat liver. Although the monodesmosides 1-4 having neutral sugar components only at the O-3 position on the aglycones showed no cytoprotective effect, bisdesmosides having sugar components at both the O-3 and O-28 positions on the aglycones had potent effects, even when the species of the sugar components were different. The bisdesmosides 10, 11, and 27 having five monosaccharides in the molecules exhibited the most potent cytoprotective effects.	MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE	INFO	{'INFO': -0.00065631996}
465	1-oleoylglycerophosphocholine	PUBMED	 The metabolic alterations occurring within the arterial architecture during atherosclerosis development remain poorly understood, let alone those particular to each arterial tunica. We aimed first to identify, in a spatially resolved manner, the specific metabolic changes in plaque, media, adventitia, and cardiac tissue between control and atherosclerotic murine aortas. Second, we assessed their translatability to human tissue and plasma for cardiovascular risk estimation. In this observational study, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) was applied to identify region-specific metabolic differences between atherosclerotic (n=11) and control (n=11) aortas from low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice, via histology-guided virtual microdissection. Early and advanced plaques were compared within the same atherosclerotic animals. Progression metabolites were further analyzed by MSI in 9 human atherosclerotic carotids and by targeted mass spectrometry in human plasma from subjects with elective coronary artery bypass grafting (cardiovascular risk group, n=27) and a control group (n=27). MSI identified 362 local metabolic alterations in atherosclerotic mice (log2 fold-change ≥1.5;  An altered phospholipid metabolism occurs in atherosclerosis, affecting both the aorta and the adjacent heart tissue. Plaque-progression lipids LPC(18:0) and LPA(18:1), as identified by MSI on tissue, reflect cardiovascular risk in human plasma. In human subjects and animal models with acute and chronic lung injury, the bioactive lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is elevated in lung lining fluids. The increased LPC can promote an inflammatory microenvironment resulting in lung injury. Furthermore, pathological lung conditions are associated with upregulated phospholipase A2 (PLA2), the predominant enzyme producing LPC in tissues by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. However, the lung cell populations responsible for increases of LPC have yet to be systematically characterized. The goal was to investigate the LPC generation by bronchial epithelial cells in response to pathological mediators and determine the major LPC species produced. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were challenged by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for 1 or 6 h, and condition medium and cells collected for quantification of predominant LPC species by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The cells were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for PLA2. The direct effects of LPC in inducing inflammatory activities on NHBE were assessed by transepithelial resistance as well as expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). VEGF stimulation of NHBE for 1 or 6 h, significantly increased concentrations of LPC16:0, LPC18:0, and LPC18:1 in condition medium compared to control. The sPLA2-selective inhibitor (oleyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) inhibited the VEGF-induced release of LPC16:0 and LPC18:1 and PLA2 activity. In contrast, NHBE stimulated with TNF did not induce LPC release. VEGF did not increase mRNA of PLA2 subtypes sPLA2-X, sPLA2-XIIa, cPLA2-IVa, and iPLA2-VI. Exogenous LPC treatment increased expression of IL-8 and MMP-1, and reduced the transepithelial resistance in NHBE. Our findings indicate that VEGF-stimulated bronchial epithelial cells are a key source of extracellular LPCs, which can function as an autocrine mediator with potential to induce airway epithelial inflammatory injury.

468	6453-58-3	PUBMED	 Calcium ions are shown to have a marked pH-dependent effect on the kinetics of benzoyllarginine ethyl ester hydrolysis by porcine enteropeptidase (EC 3.4.21.9). Below pH 6.0, calcium ions stimulate benzoylarginine ethyl ester hydrolysis but inhibit this activity above pH 6.0. This effect is mainly on the Km for benzoylarginine ethyl ester. At pH 5.3, 2mM calcium ions reduce the Km for benzoylarginine ethyl ester from 0.31 mM to 0.26 mM while at pH 6.5 the Km increases four-fold from 0.035 mM to 0.12 mM in the presence of calcium ions. Enteropeptidase activity is not inhibited by ethylenediaminetetra-acetate indicating that calcium ions are a non-essential cofactor for benzoylarginine ethyl ester hydrolysis. A thiol-activated, alpha-N-benzoylarginine-2-naph-thylamide (BANA) hydrolyzing enzyme was purified from rat skin by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and DEAE cellulose chromatography. In DEAE cellulose chromatography the enzyme was fractionated into two multiple forms (preparations I and II). The activity of undiluted preparation II, but not that of preparation I, was increased, when the enzyme was preincubated at pH 4, at 55 degrees C. Simultaneously, the isoelectric point of preparation II was shifted to that of preparation I, i.e., from 6.2 to 7.5. Activated preparation II behaved in DEAE cellulose chromatography as preparation I. Molecular weights of the enzymes of both preparations were 27 000, and pH optima were at pH 5.8 and 7.0, for BANA and leucine-2-napthylamide (Leu-NA), respectively. The BANA and Leu-NA hydrolyzing enzymes could not be separated by gel filtration, DEAE, CM, or Amberlite IRC-50 chromatography, isoelectric focusing, or analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two inhibitors of BANA hydrolase were demonstrated by gel filtration in the salt precipitated skin extract. The activities of the BANA hydrolase preparations did not increase linearly with increasing enzyme concentration, with the exceptions of activities of preparation I and acid-activated preparation II. The role of the inhibitors in the nonlinearity of the activity/enzyme concentration curves is discussed. In 40 patients with acute pancreatitis, examined 3-2 and 18-24 hours following the onset of the disease, benzoylarginine-amidase activity in blood serum and plasma was determined, as well as the activity of lipase and amylase in blood serum. A correlative dependence was found between the activity of amylase and lipase in blood serum, the activity of amylase in blood serum and trypsin-like activity in blood plasma of patients investigated in different time.

Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. The phytohormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are major players in plant immunity. Numerous studies have provided evidence that SA- and JA-mediated signaling interact with each other (SA-JA crosstalk) to orchestrate plant immune responses against pathogens. At the same time, SA-JA crosstalk is often exploited by pathogens to promote their virulence. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of molecular mechanisms for and modulations of SA-JA crosstalk during pathogen infection. No information is available on the clinical use of glycolic acid (hydroxyacetic acid) on the skin during breastfeeding. Because it is unlikely to be appreciably absorbed or appear in breastmilk, it is considered safe to use during breastfeeding.[1,2] Avoid application to areas of the body that might come in direct contact with the infant's skin or where the drug might be ingested by the infant via licking.

498	Nevadensin	PUBMED	 Lysionotin, a natural flavonoid extracted from  The antinociceptive effects of various lysionotin doses (50, 100, 150, and 200 μg/kg) were assessed in mice using the acetic acid-induced writhing test, hot plate test, and formalin-induced paw licking assay. The effects were compared to those of mice treated with acetylsalicylic acid or morphine in the presence or absence of naloxone (an opioid receptor antagonist). Capsaicin- and glutamate-induced paw licking tests were also used to evaluate the involvement of the vanilloid and glutamatergic systems, respectively. Lysionotin produced significant dose-dependent inhibition of nociceptive behavior in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, showing 60% inhibition at a dose of 200 μg/kg. Lysionotin also caused a significant increase in the latency period in response to the hot plate test (76.4% at 200 μg/kg), and significantly inhibited both the neurogenic and inflammatory phases in the formalin-induced paw licking test. Naloxone significantly reverses the effect of lysionotin in both hot plate test and formalin-induced paw licking test. Moreover, lysionotin significantly inhibited the neurogenic nociception induced by intraplantar injections of glutamate and capsaicin (57% and 67.2%, respectively at a dose of 200 μg/kg). Thus, lysionotin exhibited peripheral and central antinociception through the modulation of vanilloid receptors, opioid receptors, and the glutamatergic system. Lysionotin possesses antinociceptive activity on adult mice that is mediated through both central and peripheral pathways. To explore the potential mechanism of lysionotin in treating glioma. First, target prediction based on Bernoulli Naïve Bayes profiling and pathway enrichment was used to predict the biological activity of lysionotin. The binding between 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and lysionotin was detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and molecular docking, and the inhibitory effects of lysionotin on 5-LO and proliferation of glioma were determined using enzyme inhibition assay in vitro and cell viability analysis, respectively. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical effect of lysionotin was explored by cell survival rate analysis and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The protein expression, intracellular calcium ion concentration and cytoskeleton detection were revealed by Western blot, flow cytometry and fluorescence labeling, respectively. Target prediction and pathway enrichment revealed that lysionotin inhibited 5-LO, a key enzyme involved in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, to inhibit the proliferation of glioma. Molecular docking results demonstrated that 5-LO can be binding to lysionotin through hydrogen bonds, forming bonds with His600, Gln557, Asn554, and His372. SPR analysis further confirmed the interaction between 5-LO and lysionotin. Furthermore, enzyme inhibition assay in vitro and cell survival rate analysis revealed that 50% inhibition concentration of lysionotin and the median effective concentration of lysionotin were 90 and 16.58 µmol/L, respectively, and the results of LC-MS/MS showed that lysionotin inhibited the production of 5S-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (P<0.05), and moreover, the LC-MS/MS results indicated that lysionotin can enter glioma cells well (P<0.01) and inhibit their proliferation. Western blot analysis demonstrated that lysionotin can inhibit the expression of 5-LO (P<0.05) and downstream leukotriene B4 receptor (P<0.01). In addition, the results showed that lysionotin affected intracellular calcium ion concentration by inhibiting 5-LO to affect the cytoskeleton, as determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence labeling. Lysionotin binds to 5-LO could suppress glioma by inhibiting arachiodonic acid metabolism pathway. α-Toxin, one of the best known pore-forming proteins produced by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), is a critical virulence factor in multiple infections. The necessity of α-toxin for S. aureus pathogenicity suggests that this toxin is an important target for the development of a potential treatment strategy. In this study, we showed that lysionotin, a natural compound, can inhibit the hemolytic activity of culture supernatants by S. aureus by reducing α-toxin expression. Using real-time PCR analysis, we showed that transcription of hla (the gene encoding α-toxin) and agr (the locus regulating hla) was significantly inhibited by lysionotin. Lactate dehydrogenase and live/dead assays indicated that lysionotin effectively protected human alveolar epithelial cells against S. aureus, and in vivo studies also demonstrated that lysionotin can protect mice from pneumonia caused by S. aureus. These findings suggest that lysionotin is an efficient inhibitor of α-toxin expression and shows significant protection against S. aureus in vitro and in vivo. This study supports a potential strategy for the treatment of S. aureus infection by inhibiting the expression of virulence factors and indicates that lysionotin may be a potential treatment for S. aureus pneumonia.

516	34522-32-2	WIKIPEDIA	Octopine is a derivative of the amino acids arginine and alanine. It was the first member of the class of chemical compounds known as opines to be discovered. Octopine gets its name from Octopus octopodia from which it was first isolated in 1927. Octopine has been isolated from the muscle tissue of invertebrates such as octopus, Pecten maximus and Sipunculus nudus where it functions as an analog of lactic acid. Plants may also produce this compound after infection by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and transfer of the octopine synthesis gene from the bacterium to the plant. Octopine is formed by reductive condensation of pyruvic acid and arginine through the action of the NADH-dependent enzyme octopine dehydrogenase (ODH). The reaction is reversible so that pyruvic acid and arginine can be regenerated. == References ==	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -0.12469481}

520	Narasino	PUBMED	 Ionophores are feed additives that decrease gram-positive microbial populations by disrupting the ion transfer across cell membranes resulting in improved growth performance. Narasin (Skycis; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) is an FDA-approved ionophore utilized for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency in growing-finishing pigs. A meta-regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of added narasin in growing-finishing pig diets to predict its influence on average daily gain ( This study aimed to evaluate the residual effect of narasin on intake and ruminal fermentation parameters in Nellore cattle fed a forage-based diet. Thirty rumen-cannulated Nellore steers [initial body weight ( Complications and fata toxicity induced by chemotherapy are the main challenge for clinical management of osteosarcoma. The identification of agents that can augment the efficacy of chemotherapy at lower doses may represent an alternative therapeutic strategy. Narasin is a polyether antibiotic widely used in veterinary medicine. In this study, we show that narasin is active against osteosarcoma cells at the same concentrations that are less toxic to normal cells. This effect is achieved by growth inhibition and apoptosis induction, which is mediated by oxidative stress and damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) abolishes the anti-osteosarcoma activity. Importantly, narasin significantly augments doxorubicin's efficacy in both osteosarcoma cell culturing system and subcutaneous implantation mouse model. The combination of narasin and doxorubicin at non-toxic doses completely arrests osteosarcoma growth in mice. Our results suggest that the concurrent administration of doxorubicin and narasin could present a viable alternative therapeutic approach for osteosarcoma.

93	7-hydroxy-8,11,13-abietatrien-19-oic acid	PUBMED	 In developing iodine-123-labelled amino acid derivatives for imaging cerebral gliomas by single-photon emission tomography (SPET), we compared p-[123I]iodo-L-phenylalanine (IPA), L-[123I]iodo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7-hydroxyisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (ITIC) and L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyltyrosine (IMT) with regard to their uptake in human glioblastoma T99 and T3868 cells, and thereafter studied the mechanisms promoting the cellular uptake. The potential of the 123I-iodinated agents for use as SPET radiopharmaceuticals was evaluated in healthy experimental rats as well as in rats with stereotactically implanted C6 gliomas. The radiopharmaceutical uptake into glioblastoma cells was rapid, temperature and pH dependent, and linear during the first 5 min. Equilibrium was reached after 15-20 min, except in the case of ITIC, the initial uptake of which gradually decreased from 15 min onwards. The radioactivity concentration in glioma cells following 30-min incubation at 37 degrees C (pH 7.4) varied from 11% to 35% of the total activity per million cells (ITIC < IMT < or = IPA). Competitive inhibition experiments using alpha-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid and 2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid, known as specific substrates for systems A and L, respectively, as well as representative amino acids preferentially transported by system ASC, indicated that IPA, like IMT, is predominantly mediated by the L and ASC transport systems, while no significant involvement of the A transport system could be demonstrated. By contrast, none of the three principal neutral amino acid transport systems (A, L and ASC) appear to be substantially involved in the uptake of ITIC into glioblastoma cells. Analysis of uptake under conditions that change the cell membrane potential, i.e. in high K+ medium, showed that the membrane potential plays an important role in ITIC uptake. Alteration of the mitochondrial activity by means of valinomycin or nigericin induces a slight increase or decrease in the radiopharmaceutical uptake, suggesting a minor contribution of the mitochondria in the uptake. IPA, IMT and ITIC passed the blood-brain barrier, and thereafter showed efflux from the brain. The radioactivity concentration in healthy rat brain 15 min following intravenous injection varied from 0.07% (ITIC) to 0.27% ID/g (IPA). In comparison, the brain uptake in the stereotactically implanted C6 glioma rats was substantially higher (up to 1.10% ID/g 15 min p.i.), with tumour-to-background ratios greater than 4. These data indicate that IPA and ITIC, like IMT, exhibit interesting biological characteristics which hold promise for in vivo brain tumour investigations by SPET.	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -5.6769813e-06}

To this end, genetic code expansion methodology holds particular promise, as it allows the site-selective introduction of new functional elements into proteins as noncanonical amino acid side chains The [2+2+2] cycloaddition (CA) offers great potential as an atom economic method for the formation of substituted aromatic rings. In this article, we highlight the application of this versatile method in synthetic approaches towards substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs). The [2+2+2] CA can take over different tasks within the synthesis depending on the targeted CPP. These approaches were divided into three key steps: aromatization (which finalises the CPP), macrocyclization (the formation of a strain-reduced macrocycle) and the [2+2+2] CA. Based on this analysis the strategies were categorised into four classes based on which task the [2+2+2] CA fulfills. We point out the benefits and drawbacks of each synthesic strategy and summarize our findings to provide the reader with an easy insight into this research field.	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -9.913265e-05}

Good Cell and Tissue Culture Practice (GCCP) 2.0 is an updated guidance document from GCCP 1.0 (published by ECVAM in 2005), which was developed for practical use in the laboratory to assure the reproducibility of in vitro (cell-based) work. The update in the guidance was essential as cell models have advanced dramatically to more complex culture systems and need more comprehensive quality management to ensure reproducibility and high-quality scientific data. This document describes six main principles to consider when performing cell culture including characterization and maintenance of essential characteristics, quality management, documentation and reporting, safety, education and training, and ethics. The document does not intend to impose detailed procedures but to describe potential quality issues. It is foreseen that the document will require further updates as the science and technologies evolve over time.	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': 0.0}
393	Gln-c18:3	PUBMED	 The airway is an essential component of the body that requires protection, regardless of the reason for a patient's presence in a hospital, whether it's for outpatient surgery or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation and therapy. Hence, when contemplating intubation, physicians must carefully assess the potential for intubation failure and strategically optimize various factors to enhance the likelihood of success. Approximately 1%-3% of patients who require endotracheal intubation face challenges due to difficult airways (DAs). Identifying such patients is of utmost importance as it enables clinicians to prepare and mitigate potential complications adequately. The 3-3-2 rule is an assessment tool for predicting difficult intubations (DIs) in the cases of unexpected DAs. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, intubation is determined to be difficult to secure when a proficient and skilled anesthesiologist requires more than 3 attempts or exceeds a duration of 10 minutes for successful endotracheal intubation. Likewise, ventilation is considered challenging when a skilled clinician is unable to maintain an oxygen saturation level of above 90% while utilizing a facemask for ventilation, even with a 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': 0.0}

The incidence of tumors was nearly 100% in all groups treated with ENUR or ANUR, but with both chemicals the rats showed dose-dependent mean survival times. In the groups treated with ENUR, tumors were most frequent in the upper digestive tract and duodenum, whereas in groups given ANUR tumors were induced only in the upper digestive tract, with none in the duodenum. Tumors of the forestomach were more frequent than those of the esophagus and oral cavity and/or pharynx in groups treated with ENUR. In contrast, the target organs of ANUR were the oral cavity and/or pharynx, and the esophagus, rather than the forestomach. The carcinogenicities of these two chemicals are discussed in comparison with those of other 1-alkyl-1-nitrosourethans. A mixed culture with the ability to aerobically biodegrade 1,4-dioxane in the presence of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was enriched from a 1,4-dioxane contaminated aquifer. This consortium contained 3-4 morphologically different types of colonies and was grown in mineral salts media. Biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane began when THF concentrations in batch experiments became relatively low. No biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane was observed in the absence of THF and the measured cell yield was similar during degradation of 1,4-dioxane with THF or with THF alone. However, when the consortium was grown in the presence of 14C-1,4-dioxane plus THF, 2.1% of the radiolabeled 1,4-dioxane was present in the particulate fraction. The majority of the 14C (78.1%) was recovered as 14CO2, while 5.8% remained in the liquid fraction. This activity is interesting since the non-growth substrate is mineralized, yet only minimally assimilated into biomass. Using THF as the growth substrate, the consortium also degraded 1,3-dioxane, methyl t-butyl ether, ethyl t-butyl ether and t-amyl methyl ether.	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -9.317247e-05}

Using gel electrophoresis and immunoautoradiography/immunoblotting all three proteins were found to codistribute only partially with tubulin because considerable parts remained in the cold-insoluble fractions. Moreover, the proteins, particularly MAPs, were proteolytically degraded during cycling. By contrast, when microtubules were polymerized with taxol after isotonic cell lysis a considerable enrichment of MAP-1 and MAP-2 was achieved; again, plectin co-distributed only partially. In this procedure too, MAPs, especially MAP-2, were found to be highly subject to proteolysis, unless free Ca2+-ions were rigorously avoided. Proteolytic fragments generated from MAP-2 were of similar size independent of whether temperature- or taxol-dependent polymerization procedures were used, suggesting the occurrence of a MAP-2-specific protease. When the spatial arrangement of the high Mr proteins on taxol-polymerized C6 cell microtubules was directly visualized using gold-immunoelectron microscopy, a periodical, apparently helical, decoration of microtubules was found for MAP-1 and MAP-2; plectin was irregularly arrayed. A predominantly helical arrangement of both MAPs was demonstrated also for microtubules reconstituted from mammalian brain.	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -0.10046663}
479	Soyaspongenol c	PUBMED	 Transpeptidase-catalyzed protein and peptide modifications have been widely utilized for generating conjugates of interest for biological investigation or therapeutic applications. However, all known transpeptidases are constrained to ligating in the N-to-C orientation, limiting the scope of attainable products. Here, we report that an engineered asparaginyl ligase accepts diverse incoming nucleophile substrate mimetics, particularly when a means of selectively quenching the reactivity of byproducts released from the recognition sequence is employed. In addition to directly catalyzing formation of l-/d- or α-/β-amino acid junctions, we find C-terminal Leu-ethylenediamine (Leu-Eda) motifs to be bona fide mimetics of native N-terminal Gly-Leu sequences. Appending a C-terminal Leu-Eda to synthetic peptides or, via an intein-splicing approach, to recombinant proteins enables direct transpeptidase-catalyzed C-to-C ligations. This work significantly expands the synthetic scope of enzyme-catalyzed protein transpeptidation reactions. Copper-catalyzed and organocopper-involved reactions are of great significance in organic synthesis. To have a deep understanding of the reaction mechanisms, the structural characterizations of organocopper intermediates become indispensable. Meanwhile, the structure-function relationship of organocopper compounds could advance the rational design and development of new Cu-based reactions and organocopper reagents. Compared to the mono-carbonic ligand, the C,N- and C,C-bidentate ligands better stabilize unstable organocopper compounds. Bidentate ligands can chelate to the same copper atom via 	INFO	INFO	{'INFO': -5.5122365e-07}
