DEHP is the most common member of the class of phthalates, which are used as plasticizers. It is the diester of phthalic acid and the branched-chain 2-ethylhexanol. This colorless viscous liquid is soluble in oil, but not in water. == Production == Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate is produced commercially by the reaction of excess 2-ethylhexanol with phthalic anhydride in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid or para-toluenesulfonic acid. It was first produced in commercial quantities in Japan circa 1933 and in the United States in 1939. DEHP has two stereocenters, located at the carbon atoms carrying the ethyl groups. As a result, it has three distinct stereoisomers, consisting of an (R,R) form, an (S,S) form (diastereomers), and a meso (R, S) form. As most 2-ethylhexanol is produced as a racemic mixture, commercially-produced DEHP is therefore racemic as well, and consists of a 1:1:2 statistical mixture of stereoisomers. == Use == Due to its suitable properties and the low cost, DEHP is widely used as a plasticizer in manufacturing of articles made of PVC. Plastics may contain 1% to 40% of DEHP. It is also used as a hydraulic fluid and as a dielectric fluid in capacitors. DEHP also finds use as a solvent in glowsticks. Approximately three million tonnes are produced and used annually worldwide. Manufacturers of flexible PVC articles can choose among several alternative plasticizers offering similar technical properties as DEHP. These alternatives include other phthalates such as diisononyl phthalate (DINP), di-2-propyl heptyl phthalate (DPHP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and non-phthalates such as 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH), dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP), and citrate esters. == Environmental exposure == DEHP is a component of many household items, including tablecloths, floor tiles, shower curtains, garden hoses, rainwear, dolls, toys, shoes, medical tubing, furniture upholstery, and swimming pool liners. DEHP is an indoor air pollutant in homes and schools. Common exposures come from the use of DEHP as a fragrance carrier in cosmetics, personal care products, laundry detergents, colognes, scented candles, and air fresheners. The most common exposure to DEHP comes through food with an average consumption of 0.25 milligrams per day. It can also leach into a liquid that comes in contact with the plastic; it extracts faster into nonpolar solvents (e.g. oils and fats in foods packed in PVC). Fatty foods that are packaged in plastics that contain DEHP are more likely to have higher concentrations such as milk products, fish or seafood, and oils. The US FDA therefore permits use of DEHP-containing packaging only for foods that primarily contain water. DEHP can leach into drinking water from discharges from rubber and chemical factories; The US EPA limits for DEHP in drinking water is 6 ppb. It is also commonly found in bottled water, but unlike tap water, the EPA does not regulate levels in bottled water. DEHP levels in some European samples of milk, were found at 2000 times higher than the EPA Safe Drinking Water limits (12,000 ppb). Levels of DEHP in some European cheeses and creams were even higher, up to 200,000 ppb, in 1994. Additionally, workers in factories that utilize DEHP in production experience greater exposure. The U.S. agency OSHA\'s limit for occupational exposure is 5 mg/m3 of air. === Use in medical devices === DEHP is the most common phthalate plasticizer in medical devices such as intravenous tubing and bags, IV catheters, nasogastric tubes, dialysis bags and tubing, blood bags and transfusion tubing, and air tubes. DEHP makes these plastics softer and more flexible and was first introduced in the 1940s in blood bags. For this reason, concern has been expressed about leachates of DEHP transported into the patient, especially for those requiring extensive infusions or those who are at the highest risk of developmental abnormalities, e.g. newborns in intensive care nursery settings, hemophiliacs, kidney dialysis patients, neonates, premature babies, lactating, and pregnant women. According to the European Commission Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), exposure to DEHP may exceed the tolerable daily intake in some specific population groups, namely people exposed through medical procedures such as kidney dialysis. The American Academy of Pediatrics has advocated not to use medical devices that can leach DEHP into patients and, instead, to resort to DEHP-free alternatives. In July 2002, the U.S. FDA issued a Public Health Notification on DEHP, stating in part, ""We recommend considering such alternatives when these high-risk procedures are to be performed on male neonates, pregnant women who are carrying male fetuses, and peripubertal males"" noting that the alternatives were to look for non-DEHP exposure solutions; they mention a database of alternatives. The CBC documentary The Disappearing Male raised concerns about sexual development in male fetal development, miscarriage, and as a cause of dramatically lower sperm counts in men. A review article in 2010 in the Journal of Transfusion Medicine showed a consensus that the benefits of lifesaving treatments with these devices far outweigh the risks of DEHP leaching out of these devices. Although more research is needed to develop alternatives to DEHP that gives the same benefits of being soft and flexible, which are required for most medical procedures, if a procedure requires one of these devices and if patient is at high risk to suffer from DEHP then a DEHP alternative should be considered if medically safe. === Metabolism === DEHP hydrolyzes to mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and subsequently to phthalate salts. The released alcohol is susceptible to oxidation to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid. == Effects on living organisms == === Toxicity === The acute toxicity of DEHP is low in animal models: 30 g/kg in rats (oral) and 24 g/kg in rabbits (dermal). Concerns instead focus on its potential as an endocrine disruptor. === Endocrine disruption === DEHP, along with other phthalates, is believed to cause endocrine disruption in males, through its action as an androgen antagonist, and may have lasting effects on reproductive function, for both childhood and adult exposures. Prenatal phthalate exposure has been shown to be associated with lower levels of reproductive function in adolescent males. In another study, airborne concentrations of DEHP at a PVC pellet plant were significantly associated with a reduction in sperm motility and chromatin DNA integrity. Additionally, the authors noted the daily intake estimates for DEHP were comparable to the general population, indicating a ""high percentage of men are exposed to levels of DEHP that may affect sperm motility and chromatin DNA integrity"". The claims have received support by a study using dogs as a ""sentinel species to approximate human exposure to a selection of chemical mixtures present in the environment"". The authors analyzed the concentration of DEHP and other common chemicals such as PCBs in testes from dogs from five different world regions. The results showed that regional differences in concentration of the chemicals are reflected in dog testes and that pathologies such as tubule atrophy and germ cells were more prevalent in testes of dogs from regions with higher concentrations. === Development === Numerous studies of DEHP have shown changes in sexual function and development in mice and rats. DEHP exposure during pregnancy has been shown to disrupt placental growth and development in mice, resulting in higher rates of low birthweight, premature birth, and fetal loss. In a separate study, exposure of neonatal mice to DEHP through lactation caused hypertrophy of the adrenal glands and higher levels of anxiety during puberty. In another study, pubertal administration of higher-dose DEHP delayed puberty in rats, reduced testosterone production, and inhibited androgen-dependent development; low doses showed no effect. === Obesity === When DEHP is ingested intestinal lipases convert it to MEHP, which then is absorbed. MEHP is suspected to have an obesogenic effect. Rodent studies and human studies have shown DEHP to be a possible disruptor of thyroid function, which plays a key role in energy balance and metabolism. Exposure to DEHP has been associated with lower plasma thyroxine levels and decreased uptake of iodine in thyroid follicular cells. Previous studies have shown that slight changes in thyroxine levels can have dramatic effects on resting energy expenditure, similar to that of patients with hypothyroidism, which has been shown to cause increased weight gain in those study populations. === Cardiotoxicity === Even at relatively low doses of DEHP, cardiovascular reactivity was significantly affected in mice. A clinically relevant dose and duration of exposure to DEHP has been shown to have a significant impact on the behavior of cardiac cells in culture. This includes an uncoupling effect that leads to irregular rhythms in vitro. Untreated cells had fast conduction velocity, along with homogenous activation wave fronts and synchronized beating. Cells treated with DEHP exhibited fractured wave fronts with slow propagation speeds. This is observed in conjunction with a significant decrease in the amount of expression and instability of gap junctional connexin proteins, specifically connexin-43, in cardiomyocytes treated with DEHP. The decrease in expression and instability of connexin-43 may be due to the down regulation of tubulin and kinesin genes, and the alteration of microtubule structure, caused by DEHP; all of which are responsible for the transport of protein products. Also, DEHP caused down regulation of several growth factors, such as angiotensinogen, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor C and A, and endothelial-1. The DEHP-induced down regulation of these growth factors may also contribute to the reduced expression and instability of connexin-43. DEHP has also been shown, in vitro using cardiac muscle cells, to cause activation of PPAR-alpha gene, which is a key regulator in lipid metabolism and peroxisome proliferation; both of which can be involved in atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia, which are precursors of cardiovascular disease. Once metabolized into MEHP, the molecule has been shown to lengthen action potential duration and slow epicardial conduction velocity in Langendorff perfused rodent hearts. === Other health effects === Studies in mice have shown other adverse health effects due to DEHP exposure. Ingestion of 0.01% DEHP caused damage to the blood-testis barrier as well as induction of experimental autoimmune orchitis. There is also a correlation between DEHP plasma levels in women and endometriosis. DEHP is also a possible cancer causing agent in humans, although human studies remain inconclusive, due to the exposure of multiple elements and limited research. In vitro and rodent studies indicate that DEHP is involved in many molecular events, including increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, oxidative damage, and selective clonal expansion of the initiated cells; all of which take place in multiple sites of the human body. == Government and industry response == === Taiwan === In October 2009, Consumers\' Foundation, Taiwan (CFCT) published test results that found 5 out of the sampled 12 shoes contained over 0.1% of phthalate plasticizer content, including DEHP, which exceeds the government\'s Toy Safety Standard (CNS 4797). CFCT recommend that users should first wear socks to avoid direct skin contact. In May 2011, the illegal use of the plasticizer DEHP in clouding agents for use in food and beverages has been reported in Taiwan. An inspection of products initially discovered the presence of plasticizers. As more products were tested, inspectors found more manufacturers using DEHP and DINP. The Department of Health confirmed that contaminated food and beverages had been exported to other countries and regions, which reveals the widespread prevalence of toxic plasticizers. === European Union === Concerns about chemicals ingested by children when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission to order a temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of which is based on an opinion by the Commission\'s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other phthalates (DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of phthalates (DINP, DIDP, and DNOP) ""in toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth by children"". Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including musk xylene, MDA, HBCDD, DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in Annex XIV of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011. According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015. In 2012, Danish Environment Minister Ida Auken announced the ban of DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP, pushing Denmark ahead of the European Union which has already started a process of phasing out phthalates. However, it was postponed by two years and would take effect in 2015 and not in December 2013, which was the initial plan. The reason is that the four phthalates are far more common than expected and that producers cannot phase out phthalates as fast as the Ministry of Environment requested. In 2012, France became the first country in the EU to ban the use of DEHP in pediatrics, neonatal, and maternity wards in hospitals. DEHP has now been classified as a Category 1B reprotoxin, and is now on the Annex XIV of the European Union\'s REACH legislation. DEHP has been phased out in Europe under REACH and can only be used in specific cases if an authorization has been granted. Authorizations are granted by the European Commission, after obtaining the opinion of the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). === California === DEHP is classified as a ""chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm"" (in this case, both) under the terms of Proposition 65. == References == == Further reading == Maradonna, Francesca; Evangelisti, Matteo; Gioacchini, Giorgia; et al.

Also, DEHP caused down regulation of several growth factors, such as angiotensinogen, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor C and A, and endothelial-1. The DEHP-induced down regulation of these growth factors may also contribute to the reduced expression and instability of connexin-43. DEHP has also been shown, in vitro using cardiac muscle cells, to cause activation of PPAR-alpha gene, which is a key regulator in lipid metabolism and peroxisome proliferation; both of which can be involved in atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia, which are precursors of cardiovascular disease. Once metabolized into MEHP, the molecule has been shown to lengthen action potential duration and slow epicardial conduction velocity in Langendorff perfused rodent hearts. === Other health effects === Studies in mice have shown other adverse health effects due to DEHP exposure. Ingestion of 0.01% DEHP caused damage to the blood-testis barrier as well as induction of experimental autoimmune orchitis. There is also a correlation between DEHP plasma levels in women and endometriosis. DEHP is also a possible cancer causing agent in humans, although human studies remain inconclusive, due to the exposure of multiple elements and limited research. In vitro and rodent studies indicate that DEHP is involved in many molecular events, including increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, oxidative damage, and selective clonal expansion of the initiated cells; all of which take place in multiple sites of the human body. == Government and industry response == === Taiwan === In October 2009, Consumers' Foundation, Taiwan (CFCT) published test results that found 5 out of the sampled 12 shoes contained over 0.1% of phthalate plasticizer content, including DEHP, which exceeds the government's Toy Safety Standard (CNS 4797). CFCT recommend that users should first wear socks to avoid direct skin contact. In May 2011, the illegal use of the plasticizer DEHP in clouding agents for use in food and beverages has been reported in Taiwan. An inspection of products initially discovered the presence of plasticizers. As more products were tested, inspectors found more manufacturers using DEHP and DINP. The Department of Health confirmed that contaminated food and beverages had been exported to other countries and regions, which reveals the widespread prevalence of toxic plasticizers. === European Union === Concerns about chemicals ingested by children when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission to order a temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of which is based on an opinion by the Commission's Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other phthalates (DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of phthalates (DINP, DIDP, and DNOP) ""in toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth by children"". Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including musk xylene, MDA, HBCDD, DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in Annex XIV of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011. According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015. In 2012, Danish Environment Minister Ida Auken announced the ban of DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP, pushing Denmark ahead of the European Union which has already started a process of phasing out phthalates. However, it was postponed by two years and would take effect in 2015 and not in December 2013, which was the initial plan. The reason is that the four phthalates are far more common than expected and that producers cannot phase out phthalates as fast as the Ministry of Environment requested. In 2012, France became the first country in the EU to ban the use of DEHP in pediatrics, neonatal, and maternity wards in hospitals. DEHP has now been classified as a Category 1B reprotoxin, and is now on the Annex XIV of the European Union's REACH legislation. DEHP has been phased out in Europe under REACH and can only be used in specific cases if an authorization has been granted. Authorizations are granted by the European Commission, after obtaining the opinion of the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). === California === DEHP is classified as a ""chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm"" (in this case, both) under the terms of Proposition 65. == References == == Further reading == Maradonna, Francesca; Evangelisti, Matteo; Gioacchini, Giorgia; et al.

These conditions, such as uremia or hyperammonemia, tend to cause high levels of nitrogen in the form of ammonia in the blood. Uremic conditions are a result of defects in enzymes that convert ammonia to urea, the primary nitrogenous waste metabolite in the urea cycle. == Metabolism == Phenylacetylglutamine is the primary metabolite of the degradation of phenylacetate when in the presence of glutamine in the liver. It is also produced in higher concentrations in the body through the metabolic degradation pathway of the pharmaceutical compounds sodium phenylbutyrate, glycerol phenylbutyrate, and sodium phenylacetate, considered more toxic, that are used as treatments for the physiological dysfunction in urea cycling. Phenylbutyrate is beta-oxidized into phenylacetate which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and excreted by the kidney. Phenylacetylglutamine is the product of uremic conditions that require an alternative pathway to the urea cycle for nitrogen waste removal. This process produces comparable levels of phenylacetylglutamine in urine in relation to urea levels in a properly functioning urea cycle. In 24 hours 80-100% of a dose of phenylbutyrate is excreted in the urine as phenylacetylglutamine. The metabolism and conjugation of phenylacetate with glutamine in the liver involves amino acid acetylation carried out by the enzyme phenylacetyltranferase or glutamine N-acetyl transferase. The enzyme catalyzes the reaction of the substrates phenylacetyl-CoA and L-glutamine to produce CoA and alpha-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine and phenylacetic acid. The catalytic enzyme has been isolated in the human liver mitochondria. Furthermore, phenylacetylglutamine has been found in human urine, but not in the excretory material of rats, dogs, cats, monkeys, sheep, or horses. Throughout the metabolic process, phenylacetylglutamine is bound and conjugated by free-plasma in the kidney to remove excess nitrogen through its excretion in the urine. == As a biomarker == Elevated levels of nitrogen in the blood increase the amount of glutamine, the primary, non-toxic carrier of ammonia in the blood, within patients with hyperammonemia and inborn errors in urea synthesis. Phenylacetylglutamine levels in the urine serves as a more effective biomarker for the excretion of nitrogenous waste than measures of blood plasma, which fluctuate and are a less effective therapeutic monitor of waste nitrogen levels. A 24-hour metabolic urine test of phenylacetylglutamine provides a non-invasive biomarker of waste nitrogen that most consistently reflects the dose of phenylbutyric acid or glycerol phenylbutyrate used to treat patients with urea-cycle disorders. Phenylacetylglutamine isotopically labeled with 14C also serves more broadly to characterize relative rates of cellular reactions and functions as a general, non-invasive biomarker for gluconeogenesis and citric acid cycle intermediates in the liver. == Chronic kidney disorder == High levels of phenylacetylglutamine in the urine following metabolism by the gut microbiota may also indicate early renal decline associated with kidney dysfunction and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In CKD, phenylacetylglutamine is considered a uremic toxin which is taken up, circulated and retained in the blood after microbial fermentation of certain proteins and amino acids in the gut. Blood serum levels of phenylacetylglutamine in CKD are used as a mortality determinant.

It can be viewed as a benzyl group substituted for the methyl group of alanine, or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This essential amino acid is classified as neutral, and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. The L-isomer is used to biochemically form proteins coded for by DNA. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the biological pigment melanin. It is encoded by the messenger RNA codons UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is found naturally in the milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement as it is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenethylamine. As an essential amino acid, phenylalanine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine-containing proteins. The one-letter symbol F was assigned to phenylalanine for its phonetic similarity. == History == The first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the empirical formula, C9H11NO2, in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) seedlings. In 1882, Erlenmeyer and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia. The genetic codon for phenylalanine was first discovered by J. Heinrich Matthaei and Marshall W. Nirenberg in 1961. They showed that by using mRNA to insert multiple uracil repeats into the genome of the bacterium E. coli, they could cause the bacterium to produce a polypeptide consisting solely of repeated phenylalanine amino acids. This discovery helped to establish the nature of the coding relationship that links information stored in genomic nucleic acid with protein expression in the living cell. == Dietary sources == Good sources of phenylalanine are eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, and soybeans. Another common source of phenylalanine is anything sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame, such as diet drinks, diet foods and medication; the metabolism of aspartame produces phenylalanine as one of the compound\'s metabolites. == Dietary recommendations == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For phenylalanine plus tyrosine, for adults 19 years and older, 33 mg/kg body weight/day. In 2005 the DRI is set to 27 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine), the FAO/WHO/UNU recommendation of 2007 is 25 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine). == Other biological roles == L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids. L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier. In excessive quantities, supplementation can interfere with the production of serotonin and other aromatic amino acids as well as nitric oxide due to the overuse (eventually, limited availability) of the associated cofactors, iron or tetrahydrobiopterin. The corresponding enzymes for those compounds are the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family and nitric oxide synthase. === In plants === Phenylalanine is the starting compound used in the synthesis of flavonoids. Lignan is derived from phenylalanine and from tyrosine. Phenylalanine is converted to cinnamic acid by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. == Biosynthesis == Phenylalanine is biosynthesized via the shikimate pathway. == Phenylketonuria == The genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) is the inability to metabolize phenylalanine because of a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Individuals with this disorder are known as ""phenylketonurics"" and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood. Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and Î¼mol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 Î¼mol/L. A (rare) ""variant form"" of phenylketonuria called hyperphenylalaninemia is caused by the inability to synthesize a cofactor called tetrahydrobiopterin, which can be supplemented. Pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninemia may show similar symptoms of the disorder (high levels of phenylalanine in blood), but these indicators will usually disappear at the end of gestation. Pregnant women with PKU must control their blood phenylalanine levels even if the fetus is heterozygous for the defective gene because the fetus could be adversely affected due to hepatic immaturity. A non-food source of phenylalanine is the artificial sweetener aspartame. This compound is metabolized by the body into several chemical byproducts including phenylalanine. The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: ""Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine."" In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer to the presence of ""aspartame or E951"" and they must be labeled with a warning ""Contains a source of phenylalanine."" In Brazil, the label ""ContÃ©m Fenilalanina"" (Portuguese for ""Contains Phenylalanine"") is also mandatory in products which contain it. These warnings are placed to help individuals avoid such foods. == D-, L- and DL-phenylalanine == The stereoisomer D-phenylalanine (DPA) can be produced by conventional organic synthesis, either as a single enantiomer or as a component of the racemic mixture. It does not participate in protein biosynthesis although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been processed. The biological functions of D-amino acids remain unclear, although D-phenylalanine has pharmacological activity at niacin receptor 2. DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is marketed as a nutritional supplement for its purported analgesic and antidepressant activities, which have been supported by clinical trials. DL-Phenylalanine is a mixture of D-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of DL-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by D-phenylalanine of enkephalin degradation by the enzyme carboxypeptidase A. Enkephalins act as agonists of the mu and delta opioid receptors, and agonists of these receptors are known to produce antidepressant effects. The mechanism of DL-phenylalanine\'s supposed antidepressant activity may also be accounted for in part by the precursor role of L-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, though clinical trials have not found an antidepressant effect from L-phenylalanine alone. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect. D-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the portal circulation. A small amount of D-phenylalanine appears to be converted to L-phenylalanine. D-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the systemic circulation. It appears to cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier less efficiently than L-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of D-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine without penetrating the central nervous system. L-Phenylalanine is an antagonist at Î±2Î´ Ca2+ calcium channels with a Ki of 980 nM. In the brain, L-phenylalanine is a competitive antagonist at the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor and at the glutamate binding site of AMPA receptor. At the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor L-phenylalanine has an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of 573 Î¼M estimated by Schild regression which is considerably lower than brain L-phenylalanine concentration observed in untreated human phenylketonuria. L-Phenylalanine also inhibits neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex with IC50 of 980 Î¼M, a brain concentration seen in classical phenylketonuria, whereas D-phenylalanine has a significantly smaller effect. == Commercial synthesis == L-Phenylalanine is produced for medical, feed, and nutritional applications, such as aspartame, in large quantities by utilizing the bacterium Escherichia coli, which naturally produces aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine. The quantity of L-phenylalanine produced commercially has been increased by genetically engineering E. coli, such as by altering the regulatory promoters or amplifying the number of genes controlling enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the amino acid. == Derivatives == Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, used in neutron capture therapy. 4-Azido-L-phenylalanine is a protein-incorporated unnatural amino acid used as a tool for bioconjugation in the field of chemical biology. == References == == External links == Phenylalanine mass spectrum Phenylalanine at ChemSynthesis'), 'MEDICAL, FOOD')"	WIKIPEDIA	"Phenylalanine (symbol Phe or F) is an essential Î±-amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2.

In HepG2 cells, lipopolyplexes containing LS showed high transgene efficiency comparable to lipopolyplex 2P-2D. After intravenous injection of the complexes into mice, lipopolyplexes containing LS showed high transgene efficiency, comparable to lipopolyplex 2P-2D. In particular, lipopolyplexes containing LS showed extremely high transgene efficiency in the lung. As a result of the analysis to identify optimum formulations, we discovered that LS contributed to the high transgene efficiency in the lung as 76.7% of the contribution index. These results suggest that lipopolyplexes containing LS are safe and useful gene delivery vectors with lung directivity.	2829	PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL	True

Certified Reference Material']	"(('WIKIPEDIA', 'Melatonin, an indoleamine, is a natural compound produced by various organisms, including bacteria and eukaryotes. Its discovery in 1958 by Aaron B. Lerner and colleagues stemmed from the isolation of a substance from the pineal gland of cows that could induce skin lightening in common frogs. This compound was later identified as a hormone secreted in the brain during the night, playing a crucial role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm, in vertebrates. In vertebrates, melatonin\'s functions extend to synchronizing sleep-wake cycles, encompassing sleep-wake timing and blood pressure regulation, as well as controlling seasonal rhythmicity (circannual cycle), which includes reproduction, fattening, molting, and hibernation. Its effects are mediated through the activation of melatonin receptors and its role as an antioxidant. In plants and bacteria, melatonin primarily serves as a defense mechanism against oxidative stress, indicating its evolutionary significance. The mitochondria, key organelles within cells, are the main producers of antioxidant melatonin, underscoring the molecule\'s ""ancient origins"" and its fundamental role in protecting the earliest cells from reactive oxygen species. In addition to its endogenous functions as a hormone and antioxidant, melatonin is also administered exogenously as a dietary supplement and medication. It is utilized in the treatment of sleep disorders, including insomnia and various circadian rhythm sleep disorders. == Biological activity == In humans, melatonin primarily acts as a potent full agonist of two types of melatonin receptors: melatonin receptor 1, with picomolar binding affinity, and melatonin receptor 2, with nanomolar binding affinity. Both receptors are part of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) family, specifically the Gi/o alpha subunit GPCRs, although melatonin receptor 1 also exhibits coupling with Gq alpha subunit. Furthermore, melatonin functions as a high-capacity antioxidant, or free radical scavenger, within mitochondria, playing a dual role in combating cellular oxidative stress. First, it directly neutralizes free radicals, and second, it promotes the gene expression of essential antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase. This increase in antioxidant enzyme expression is mediated through signal transduction pathways activated by the binding of melatonin to its receptors. Through these mechanisms, melatonin protects the cell against oxidative stress in two ways, and plays other roles in human health than only regulating the sleep-wake cycle. == Biological functions == === Circadian rhythm === In mammals, melatonin is critical for the regulation of sleepâ€“wake cycles, or circadian rhythms. The establishment of regular melatonin levels in human infants occurs around the third month after birth, with peak concentrations observed between midnight and 8:00 am. It has been documented that melatonin production diminishes as a person ages. Additionally, a shift in the timing of melatonin secretion is observed during adolescence, resulting in delayed sleep and wake times, increasing their risk for delayed sleep phase disorder during this period. The antioxidant properties of melatonin were first recognized in 1993. In vitro studies reveal that melatonin directly neutralizes various reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl (OHâ€¢), superoxide (O2âˆ’â€¢), and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide (NOâ€¢). In plants, melatonin works synergistically with other antioxidants, enhancing the overall effectiveness of each antioxidant. This compound has been found to be twice as efficacious as vitamin E, a known potent lipophilic antioxidant, in combating oxidative stress. The promotion of antioxidant enzyme expression, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase, is mediated through melatonin receptor-triggered signal transduction pathways. Melatonin\'s concentration in the mitochondrial matrix is significantly higher than that found in the blood plasma, emphasizing its role not only in direct free radical scavenging but also in modulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes and maintaining mitochondrial integrity. This multifaceted role shows the physiological significance of melatonin as a mitochondrial antioxidant, a notion supported by numerous scholars. Furthermore, the interaction of melatonin with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species results in the formation of metabolites capable of reducing free radicals. These metabolites, including cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), and N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMK), contribute to the broader antioxidative effects of melatonin through further redox reactions with free radicals. === Immune system === Melatonin\'s interaction with the immune system is recognized, yet the specifics of these interactions remain inadequately defined. An anti-inflammatory effect appears to be the most significant. The efficacy of melatonin in disease treatment has been the subject of limited trials, with most available data deriving from small-scale, preliminary studies. It is posited that any beneficial immunological impact is attributable to melatonin\'s action on high-affinity receptors (MT1 and MT2), which are present on immunocompetent cells. Preclinical investigations suggest that melatonin may augment cytokine production and promote the expansion of T cells, thereby potentially mitigating acquired immunodeficiencies. === Weight regulation === Melatonin\'s potential to regulate weight gain is posited to involve its inhibitory effect on leptin, a hormone that serves as a long-term indicator of the body\'s energy status. Leptin is important for regulating energy balance and body weight by signaling satiety and reducing food intake. Melatonin, by modulating leptin\'s actions outside of waking hours, may contribute to the restoration of leptin sensitivity during daytime, thereby counteracting leptin resistance. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of melatonin in animals involves a sequence of enzymatic reactions starting with L-tryptophan, which can be synthesized through the shikimate pathway from chorismate, found in plants, or obtained from protein catabolism. The initial step in the melatonin biosynthesis pathway is the hydroxylation of L-tryptophan\'s indole ring by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Subsequently, 5-HTP undergoes decarboxylation, facilitated by pyridoxal phosphate and the enzyme 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase, yielding serotonin. Serotonin, an essential neurotransmitter, is further converted into N-acetylserotonin by the action of serotonin N-acetyltransferase, utilizing acetyl-CoA. The final step in the pathway involves the methylation of N-acetylserotonin\'s hydroxyl group by hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase, with S-adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor, to produce melatonin. In bacteria, protists, fungi, and plants, the synthesis of melatonin also involves tryptophan as an intermediate but originates indirectly from the shikimate pathway. The pathway commences with D-erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and in photosynthetic cells, additionally involves carbon dioxide. While the subsequent biosynthetic reactions share similarities with those in animals, there are slight variations in the enzymes involved in the final stages. The hypothesis that melatonin synthesis occurs within mitochondria and chloroplasts suggests an evolutionary and functional significance of melatonin in cellular energy metabolism and defense mechanisms against oxidative stress, reflecting the molecule\'s ancient origins and its multifaceted roles across different domains of life. === Mechanism === The mechanism of melatonin biosynthesis initiates with the hydroxylation of L-tryptophan, a process that requires the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (THB) to react with oxygen and the active site iron of tryptophan hydroxylase. Although the complete mechanism is not entirely understood, two main mechanisms have been proposed: The first mechanism involves a slow transfer of one electron from THB to molecular oxygen (O2), potentially producing a superoxide (Oâˆ’2). This superoxide could then recombine with the THB radical to form 4a-peroxypterin. 4a-peroxypterin may either react with the active site iron (II) to create an iron-peroxypterin intermediate or directly transfer an oxygen atom to the iron, facilitating the hydroxylation of L-tryptophan. Alternatively, the second mechanism proposes that oxygen interacts with the active site iron (II) first, forming iron (III) superoxide. This molecule could then react with THB to form an iron-peroxypterin intermediate. Following the formation of iron (IV) oxide from the iron-peroxypterin intermediate, this oxide selectively attacks a double bond to yield a carbocation at the C5 position of the indole ring. A subsequent 1,2-shift of the hydrogen and the loss of one of the two hydrogen atoms on C5 would restore aromaticity, producing 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan. The decarboxylation of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan to produce 5-hydroxytryptamine is then facilitated by a decarboxylase enzyme with pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. PLP forms an imine with the amino acid derivative, facilitating the breaking of the carbonâ€“carbon bond and release of carbon dioxide. The protonation of the amine derived from tryptophan restores the aromaticity of the pyridine ring, leading to the production of 5-hydroxytryptamine and PLP. Serotonin N-acetyltransferase, with histidine residue His122, is hypothesized to deprotonate the primary amine of 5-hydroxytryptamine. This deprotonation allows the lone pair on the amine to attack acetyl-CoA, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. The thiol from coenzyme A then acts as a leaving group when attacked by a general base, producing N-acetylserotonin. The final step in the biosynthesis of melatonin involves the methylation of N-acetylserotonin at the hydroxyl position by SAM, resulting in the production of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and melatonin. === Regulation === In vertebrates, the secretion of melatonin is regulated through the activation of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor by the hormone norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increases the concentration of intracellular cAMP via beta-adrenergic receptors, which in turn activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), the penultimate enzyme in the melatonin synthesis pathway. When exposed to daylight, noradrenergic stimulation ceases, leading to the immediate degradation of the protein by proteasomal proteolysis. The production of melatonin recommences in the evening, a phase known as the dim-light melatonin onset. Blue light, especially within the 460â€“480 nm range, inhibits the biosynthesis of melatonin, with the degree of suppression being directly proportional to the intensity and duration of light exposure. Historically, humans in temperate climates experienced limited exposure to blue daylight during winter months, primarily receiving light from sources that emitted predominantly yellow light, such as fires. The incandescent light bulbs used extensively throughout the 20th century emitted relatively low levels of blue light. It has been found that light containing only wavelengths greater than 530 nm does not suppress melatonin under bright-light conditions. The use of glasses that block blue light in the hours preceding bedtime can mitigate melatonin suppression. Additionally, wearing blue-blocking goggles during the last hours before bedtime is recommended for individuals needing to adjust to an earlier bedtime since melatonin facilitates the onset of sleep. === Metabolism === Melatonin is metabolized with an elimination half-life ranging from 20 to 50 minutes. The primary metabolic pathway transforms melatonin into 6-hydroxymelatonin, which is then conjugated with sulfate and excreted in urine as a waste product. It is primarily metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A1, CYP2C19, and CYP1B1. === Measurement === For both research and clinical purposes, melatonin levels in humans can be determined through saliva or blood plasma analysis. == Use as a medication and supplement == Melatonin is used both as a prescription medication and an over-the-counter dietary supplement for the management of sleep disorders, including insomnia and various circadian rhythm sleep disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder, jet lag disorder, and shift work sleep disorder. In addition to melatonin, a range of synthetic melatonin receptor agonists, namely ramelteon, tasimelteon, and agomelatine, are used in medicine. A study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in April 2023 found that only 12% of the 30 melatonin gummy product preparations analyzed had melatonin quantities within Â±10% of the amounts specified on their labels. Some gummy supplements were found to contain up to 347% of the declared melatonin content. In Europe, melatonin is classified as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, highlighting the regulatory oversight of its use and distribution. Conversely, as of 2022, the United States was considering the inclusion of melatonin in pharmacy compounding practices. A preceding study from 2022 concluded that consuming unregulated melatonin products can expose individuals, including children, to melatonin quantities ranging from 40 to 130 times higher than the recommended levels when products are used \'as directed\'. Anecdotal reports and formal research studies over the past few decades have established a link between melatonin supplementation and more vivid dreams. == History == === Discovery === Melatonin\'s discovery is linked to the study of skin color changes in some amphibians and reptiles, a phenomenon initially observed through the administration of pineal gland extracts. In 1917, Carey Pratt McCord and Floyd P. Allen found that feeding extracts from the pineal glands of cows caused the skin of tadpoles to lighten by contracting the dark epidermal melanophores. The hormone melatonin was isolated in 1958 by Aaron B. Lerner, a dermatology professor, and his team at Yale University. Motivated by the possibility that a substance from the pineal gland could be beneficial in treating skin diseases, they extracted and identified melatonin from bovine pineal gland extracts. Subsequent research in the mid-1970s by Lynch and others demonstrated that melatonin production follows a circadian rhythm in human pineal glands. The first patent for the therapeutic use of melatonin as a low-dose sleep aid was awarded to Richard Wurtman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1995. === Etymology === The etymology of melatonin stems from its skin-lightening properties. As detailed in their publication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Lerner and his colleagues proposed the name melatonin, derived from the Greek words melas, meaning \'black\' or \'dark\', and tonos, meaning \'labour\', \'colour\' or \'suppress\'. This naming convention follows that of serotonin, another agent affecting skin color, discovered in 1948 as a modulator of vascular tone, which influenced its name based on its serum vasoconstrictor effect. Melatonin was thus aptly named to reflect its role in preventing the darkening of the skin, highlighting the intersection of biochemistry and linguistics in scientific discovery. == Occurrence == === Animals and Humans === In vertebrates, melatonin is produced in darkness, thus usually at night, by the pineal gland, a small endocrine gland located in the center of the brain but outside the bloodâ€“brain barrier. Light/dark information reaches the suprachiasmatic nuclei from retinal photosensitive ganglion cells of the eyes rather than the melatonin signal (as was once postulated). Known as ""the hormone of darkness"", the onset of melatonin at dusk promotes activity in nocturnal (night-active) animals and sleep in diurnal ones including humans. In humans, ~30 Î¼g of melatonin is produced daily and 80% of the total amount is produced in the night (W). The plasma maximum concentration of melatonin at night are 80â€“120 pg/mL and the concentrations during the day are between 10â€“20 pg/mL. Many animals and humans use the variation in duration of melatonin production each day as a seasonal clock. In animals including humans, the profile of melatonin synthesis and secretion is affected by the variable duration of night in summer as compared to winter. The change in duration of secretion thus serves as a biological signal for the organization of daylength-dependent (photoperiodic) seasonal functions such as reproduction, behavior, coat growth, and camouflage coloring in seasonal animals. In seasonal breeders that do not have long gestation periods and that mate during longer daylight hours, the melatonin signal controls the seasonal variation in their sexual physiology, and similar physiological effects can be induced by exogenous melatonin in animals including mynah birds and hamsters. Melatonin can suppress libido by inhibiting secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the anterior pituitary gland, especially in mammals that have a breeding season when daylight hours are long. The reproduction of long-day breeders is repressed by melatonin and the reproduction of short-day breeders is stimulated by melatonin. In sheep, melatonin administration has also shown antioxidant and immune-modulatory regime in prenatally stressed offspring helping them survive the crucial first days of their lives. During the night, melatonin regulates leptin, lowering its levels. Cetaceans have lost all the genes for melatonin synthesis as well as those for melatonin receptors. This is thought to be related to their unihemispheric sleep pattern (one brain hemisphere at a time). Similar trends have been found in sirenians. === Plants === Until its identification in plants in 1987, melatonin was for decades thought to be primarily an animal neurohormone. When melatonin was identified in coffee extracts in the 1970s, it was believed to be a byproduct of the extraction process. Subsequently, however, melatonin has been found in all plants that have been investigated. It is present in all the different parts of plants, including leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and seeds, in varying proportions. Melatonin concentrations differ not only among plant species, but also between varieties of the same species depending on the agronomic growing conditions, varying from picograms to several micrograms per gram. Notably high melatonin concentrations have been measured in popular beverages such as coffee, tea, wine, and beer, and crops including corn, rice, wheat, barley, and oats. In some common foods and beverages, including coffee and walnuts, the concentration of melatonin has been estimated or measured to be sufficiently high to raise the blood level of melatonin above daytime baseline values. Although a role for melatonin as a plant hormone has not been clearly established, its involvement in processes such as growth and photosynthesis is well established. Only limited evidence of endogenous circadian rhythms in melatonin levels has been demonstrated in some plant species and no membrane-bound receptors analogous to those known in animals have been described. Rather, melatonin performs important roles in plants as a growth regulator, as well as environmental stress protector. It is synthesized in plants when they are exposed to both biological stresses, for example, fungal infection, and nonbiological stresses such as extremes of temperature, toxins, increased soil salinity, drought, etc. Herbicide-induced oxidative stress has been experimentally mitigated in vivo in a high-melatonin transgenic rice. Studies conducted on lettuce grown in saline soil conditions have shown that the application of melatonin significantly mitigates the harmful effects of salinity. Foliar application increases the number of leaves, their surface area, increases fresh weight and the content of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, and the content of carotenoids compared to plants not treated with melatonin. Fungal disease resistance is another role. Added melatonin increases resistance in Malus prunifolia against Diplocarpon mali. Also acts as a growth inhibitor on fungal pathogens including Alternaria, Botrytis, and Fusarium spp. Decreases the speed of infection. As a seed treatment, protects Lupinus albus from fungi. Dramatically slows Pseudomonas syringae tomato DC3000 infecting Arabidopsis thaliana and infecting Nicotiana benthamiana. === Fungi === Melatonin has been observed to reduce stress tolerance in Phytophthora infestans in plant-pathogen systems. Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk have used genetically modified yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to produce melatonin. === Bacteria === Melatonin is produced by Î±-proteobacteria and photosynthetic cyanobacteria. There is no report of its occurrence in archaea which indicates that melatonin originated in bacteria most likely to prevent the first cells from the damaging effects of oxygen in the primitive Earth\'s atmosphere. Novo Nordisk have used genetically modified Escherichia coli to produce melatonin. === Archaea === In 2022, the discovery of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT)â€”the penultimate, rate-limiting enzyme in the melatonin biosynthetic pathwayâ€”in the archaeon Thermoplasma volcanium firmly places melatonin biosynthesis in all three major domains of life, dating back to ~4 Gya. === Food products === Naturally-occurring melatonin has been reported in foods including tart cherries to about 0.17â€“13.46 ng/g, bananas, plums, grapes, rice, cereals, herbs, olive oil, wine, and beer. The consumption of milk and sour cherries may improve sleep quality. When birds ingest melatonin-rich plant feed, such as rice, the melatonin binds to melatonin receptors in their brains. When humans consume foods rich in melatonin, such as banana, pineapple, and orange, the blood levels of melatonin increase significantly. == References == == External links == ""Melatonin"".

Its discovery in 1958 by Aaron B. Lerner and colleagues stemmed from the isolation of a substance from the pineal gland of cows that could induce skin lightening in common frogs. This compound was later identified as a hormone secreted in the brain during the night, playing a crucial role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm, in vertebrates. In vertebrates, melatonin's functions extend to synchronizing sleep-wake cycles, encompassing sleep-wake timing and blood pressure regulation, as well as controlling seasonal rhythmicity (circannual cycle), which includes reproduction, fattening, molting, and hibernation. Its effects are mediated through the activation of melatonin receptors and its role as an antioxidant. In plants and bacteria, melatonin primarily serves as a defense mechanism against oxidative stress, indicating its evolutionary significance. The mitochondria, key organelles within cells, are the main producers of antioxidant melatonin, underscoring the molecule's ""ancient origins"" and its fundamental role in protecting the earliest cells from reactive oxygen species. In addition to its endogenous functions as a hormone and antioxidant, melatonin is also administered exogenously as a dietary supplement and medication. It is utilized in the treatment of sleep disorders, including insomnia and various circadian rhythm sleep disorders. == Biological activity == In humans, melatonin primarily acts as a potent full agonist of two types of melatonin receptors: melatonin receptor 1, with picomolar binding affinity, and melatonin receptor 2, with nanomolar binding affinity. Both receptors are part of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) family, specifically the Gi/o alpha subunit GPCRs, although melatonin receptor 1 also exhibits coupling with Gq alpha subunit. Furthermore, melatonin functions as a high-capacity antioxidant, or free radical scavenger, within mitochondria, playing a dual role in combating cellular oxidative stress. First, it directly neutralizes free radicals, and second, it promotes the gene expression of essential antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase. This increase in antioxidant enzyme expression is mediated through signal transduction pathways activated by the binding of melatonin to its receptors. Through these mechanisms, melatonin protects the cell against oxidative stress in two ways, and plays other roles in human health than only regulating the sleep-wake cycle. == Biological functions == === Circadian rhythm === In mammals, melatonin is critical for the regulation of sleepâ€“wake cycles, or circadian rhythms. The establishment of regular melatonin levels in human infants occurs around the third month after birth, with peak concentrations observed between midnight and 8:00 am. It has been documented that melatonin production diminishes as a person ages. Additionally, a shift in the timing of melatonin secretion is observed during adolescence, resulting in delayed sleep and wake times, increasing their risk for delayed sleep phase disorder during this period. The antioxidant properties of melatonin were first recognized in 1993. In vitro studies reveal that melatonin directly neutralizes various reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl (OHâ€¢), superoxide (O2âˆ’â€¢), and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide (NOâ€¢). In plants, melatonin works synergistically with other antioxidants, enhancing the overall effectiveness of each antioxidant. This compound has been found to be twice as efficacious as vitamin E, a known potent lipophilic antioxidant, in combating oxidative stress. The promotion of antioxidant enzyme expression, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase, is mediated through melatonin receptor-triggered signal transduction pathways. Melatonin's concentration in the mitochondrial matrix is significantly higher than that found in the blood plasma, emphasizing its role not only in direct free radical scavenging but also in modulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes and maintaining mitochondrial integrity. This multifaceted role shows the physiological significance of melatonin as a mitochondrial antioxidant, a notion supported by numerous scholars. Furthermore, the interaction of melatonin with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species results in the formation of metabolites capable of reducing free radicals. These metabolites, including cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), and N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMK), contribute to the broader antioxidative effects of melatonin through further redox reactions with free radicals. === Immune system === Melatonin's interaction with the immune system is recognized, yet the specifics of these interactions remain inadequately defined. An anti-inflammatory effect appears to be the most significant. The efficacy of melatonin in disease treatment has been the subject of limited trials, with most available data deriving from small-scale, preliminary studies. It is posited that any beneficial immunological impact is attributable to melatonin's action on high-affinity receptors (MT1 and MT2), which are present on immunocompetent cells. Preclinical investigations suggest that melatonin may augment cytokine production and promote the expansion of T cells, thereby potentially mitigating acquired immunodeficiencies. === Weight regulation === Melatonin's potential to regulate weight gain is posited to involve its inhibitory effect on leptin, a hormone that serves as a long-term indicator of the body's energy status.

Novo Nordisk have used genetically modified Escherichia coli to produce melatonin. === Archaea === In 2022, the discovery of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT)â€”the penultimate, rate-limiting enzyme in the melatonin biosynthetic pathwayâ€”in the archaeon Thermoplasma volcanium firmly places melatonin biosynthesis in all three major domains of life, dating back to ~4 Gya. === Food products === Naturally-occurring melatonin has been reported in foods including tart cherries to about 0.17â€“13.46 ng/g, bananas, plums, grapes, rice, cereals, herbs, olive oil, wine, and beer. The consumption of milk and sour cherries may improve sleep quality. When birds ingest melatonin-rich plant feed, such as rice, the melatonin binds to melatonin receptors in their brains. When humans consume foods rich in melatonin, such as banana, pineapple, and orange, the blood levels of melatonin increase significantly. == References == == External links == ""Melatonin"".

Applied to the skin it is used for fungal skin infections such as tinea, cutaneous candidiasis, pityriasis versicolor, dandruff, and seborrheic dermatitis. Taken by mouth it is a less preferred option and only recommended for severe infections when other agents cannot be used. Other uses include treatment of excessive male-patterned hair growth in women and Cushing's syndrome. Common side effects when applied to the skin include redness. Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, headache, and liver problems. Liver problems may result in death or the need for a liver transplantation. Other severe side effects when taken by mouth include QT prolongation, adrenocortical insufficiency, and anaphylaxis. It is an imidazole and works by hindering the production of ergosterol required for the fungal cell membrane, thereby slowing growth. Ketoconazole was patented in 1977 by Belgian pharmaceutical company Janssen, and came into medical use in 1981. It is available as a generic medication and formulations that are applied to the skin are over the counter in the United Kingdom. In 2022, it was the 175th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. The formulation that is taken by mouth was withdrawn in the European Union and in Australia in 2013, and in China in 2015. In addition, its use was restricted in the United States and Canada in 2013. == Medical uses == === Topical antifungal === Topically administered ketoconazole is usually prescribed for fungal infections of the skin and mucous membranes, such as athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis (yeast infection or thrush), jock itch, and tinea versicolor. Topical ketoconazole is also used as a treatment for dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp) and for seborrheic dermatitis on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus Malassezia furfur on the skin. === Systemic antifungal === Ketoconazole has activity against many kinds of fungi that may cause human disease, such as Candida, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and Blastomyces (although it is not active against Aspergillus), chromomycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis. First made in 1977, ketoconazole was the first orally-active azole antifungal medication. However, ketoconazole has largely been replaced as a first-line systemic antifungal medication by other azole antifungal agents, such as fluconazole and/or itraconazole, because of ketoconazole's greater toxicity, poorer absorption, and more limited spectrum of activity. Ketoconazole is used orally in dosages of 200 to 400 mg per day in the treatment of superficial and deep fungal infections. === Off-label uses === ==== Hair loss ==== Ketoconazole shampoo in conjunction with an oral 5Î±-reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride has been used off label to treat androgenic alopecia. It was speculated that antifungal properties of ketoconazole reduce scalp microflora and consequently may reduce follicular inflammation that contributes to alopecia. Limited clinical studies suggest ketoconazole shampoo used either alone or in combination with other treatments may be useful in reducing hair loss in some cases. ==== Hormonal ==== The side effects of ketoconazole are sometimes harnessed in the treatment of non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol ergosterol in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800 mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several enzymes necessary for the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol. Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, 17Î±-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which convert pregnenolone into androgens, and 11Î²-hydroxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. All of these enzymes are mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzymes. Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat hirsutism and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited precocious puberty. In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism. Ketoconazole has been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. == Contraindications == Oral ketoconazole has various contraindications, such as concomitant use with certain other drugs due to known drug interactions. Other contraindications of oral ketoconazole include liver disease, adrenal insufficiency, and known hypersensitivity to oral ketoconazole. == Side effects == === Gastrointestinal === Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, dry mouth, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, flatulence, tongue discoloration may occur. === Endocrine === The drug may cause adrenal insufficiency so the level of the adrenocortical hormones should be monitored while taking it. Oral ketoconazole at a dosage range of 400 to 2,000 mg/day has been found to result in a rate of gynecomastia of 21%. === Liver === In July 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that taking ketoconazole by mouth can cause severe liver injuries and adrenal gland problems: adrenal insufficiency and worsening of other related to the gland conditions. It recommends oral tablets should not be a first-line treatment for any fungal infection. It should be used for the treatment of certain fungal infections, known as endemic mycoses, only when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or not tolerated. As contraindication it should not be used in people with acute or chronic liver disease. === Hypersensitivity === Anaphylaxis after the first dose may occur. Other cases of hypersensitivity include urticaria. === Topical formulations === The topical formulations have not been associated with liver damage, adrenal problems, or drug interactions. These formulations include creams, shampoos, foams, and gels applied to the skin, unlike the ketoconazole tablets, which are taken by mouth. === Pregnancy === Ketoconazole is categorized as pregnancy category C in the US. Research in animals has shown it to cause teratogenesis when administered in high doses. A subsequent trial in Europe failed to show a risk to infants of mothers receiving ketoconazole. == Overdose == In the event of an overdose of oral ketoconazole, treatment should be supportive and based on symptoms. Activated charcoal may be administered within the first hour following overdose of oral ketoconazole. == Interactions == The concomitant use of the following medications is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone irinotecan, lurasidone, colchicine alprazolam, oral midazolam, oral triazolam felodipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin ergot alkaloids: ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, methylergometrine Others: cisapride, nisoldipine, dofetilide, pimozide And is not recommended: carbamazepine, phenytoin gastric acid suppressants: antacids, antimuscarinics, histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors sucralfate rifampin, rifabutin, isoniazid efavirenz, nevirapine Ritonavir is known for increasing activity of the ketoconazole so it is recommended to reduce dosage. There is also a list of drugs which significantly decrease systemic exposure to the ketoconazole and drugs whose systemic exposure is increased by the ketoconazole. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antifungal activity ==== As an antifungal, ketoconazole is structurally similar to imidazole, and interferes with the fungal synthesis of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, as well as certain enzymes. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 14Î±-demethylase (CYP51A1). This enzyme participates in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from lanosterol to ergosterol. Lower doses of fluconazole and itraconazole are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, as they have been found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes. Resistance to ketoconazole has been observed in a number of clinical fungal isolates, including Candida albicans. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. Multidrug-resistance (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family. ==== Antihormonal activity ==== As an antiandrogen, ketoconazole operates through at least two mechanisms of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 40 mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading to a reduction in circulating testosterone levels. It produces this effect through inhibition of 17Î±-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of steroids, including the precursors of testosterone. Due to its efficacy at reducing systemic androgen levels, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Second, ketoconazole is an androgen receptor antagonist, competing with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to the androgen receptor. This effect is thought to be quite weak however, even with high oral doses of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole, along with miconazole, has been found to act as an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor. Ketoconazole is a racemic mixture consisting of cis-(2S,4R)-(âˆ’) and cis-(2R,4S)-(+) enantiomers. The cis-(2S,4R) isomer was more potent in inhibiting progesterone 17Î±,20-lyase than its enantiomer (IC50 values of 0.05 and 2.38 Î¼M, respectively) and in inhibiting 11Î²-hydroxylase (IC50 values of 0.152 and 0.608 Î¼M, respectively). Both isomers were relatively weak inhibitors of human placental aromatase. Oral ketoconazole has been used clinically as a steroidogenesis inhibitor in men, women, and children at dosages of 200 to 1,200 mg/day. Numerous small studies have investigated the effects of oral ketoconazole on hormone levels in humans. It has been found in men to significantly decrease testosterone and estradiol levels and to significantly increase luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone levels, whereas levels of androstenedione, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were unaffected. The ratio of testosterone to estradiol is also decreased during oral ketoconazole therapy in men. Suppression of testosterone levels by ketoconazole is generally partial and has often been found to be transient. Better effects on suppression of testosterone levels have been observed in men when ketoconazole is combined with a GnRH agonist to suppress the hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“gonadal axis, which prevents compensatory upregulation of luteinizing hormone secretion and consequent activation of gonadal testosterone production. In premenopausal women with polycystic ovary syndrome, ketoconazole has been found to significantly decrease levels of androstenedione and testosterone and significantly increase levels of 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone and estradiol. Studies in postmenopausal women with breast cancer have found that ketoconazole significantly decreases androstenedione levels, slightly decreases estradiol levels, and does not affect estrone levels. This indicates minimal inhibition of aromatase by ketoconazole in vivo in humans. Ketoconazole has also been found to decrease levels of endogenous corticosteroids, such as cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone, as well as vitamin D. Ketoconazole has been found to displace dihydrotestosterone and estradiol from sex hormone-binding globulin in vitro, but this was not found to be relevant in vivo. ==== Other activities ==== Ketoconazole has been found to inhibit the activity of the cation channel TRPM5. === Pharmacokinetics === When administered orally, ketoconazole is best absorbed at highly acidic levels, so antacids or other causes of decreased stomach acid levels will lower the drug's absorption. Absorption can be increased by taking it with an acidic beverage, such as cola. Ketoconazole is very lipophilic and tends to accumulate in fatty tissues. == Chemistry == Ketoconazole is a synthetic imidazole. It is a nonsteroidal compound. It is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, levoketoconazole ((2S,4R)-(âˆ’)-ketoconazole) and dextroketoconazole ((2R,4S)-(+)-ketoconazole). Levoketoconazole is under development for potential clinical use as a steroidogenesis inhibitor with better tolerability and less toxicity than ketoconazole. Other steroidogenesis inhibitors besides ketoconazole and levoketoconazole include the nonsteroidal compound aminoglutethimide and the steroidal compound abiraterone acetate. == History == Ketoconazole was discovered in 1976 at Janssen Pharmaceuticals. It was patented in 1977, followed by introduction in the United States in July 1981. Following its introduction, ketoconazole was the only systemic antifungal available for almost a decade. Ketoconazole was introduced as the prototypical medication of the imidazole group of antifungals. Oral ketoconazole has been replaced with oral fluconazole or itraconazole for many mycoses. Due to incidence of serious liver toxicity, the use of oral ketoconazole was suspended in France in July 2011, following review. This event triggered an evaluation of oral ketoconazole throughout the rest of the European Union. In 2013, oral ketoconazole was withdrawn in the European Union and Australia, and strict restrictions were placed on the use of oral ketoconazole in the United States and Canada. Oral ketoconazole is indicated for use in these countries when the indication is a severe or life-threatening systemic infection and alternatives are unavailable. However, topical ketoconazole, which does not distribute systemically, is safe and widely used still. Ketoconazole HRA was approved for use in the European Union for treatment of Cushing's syndrome in November 2013. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Ketoconazole is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Ketoconazole has been marketed under a large number of brand names. === Availability === Ketoconazole is available widely throughout the world. In 2013, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that a ban be imposed on the use of oral ketoconazole for systemic use in humans throughout the European Union, after concluding that the risk of serious liver injury from systemic ketoconazole outweighs its benefits. == Research == As of March 2019, oral levoketoconazole (developmental code name COR-003, tentative brand name Recorlev) is phase III clinical trials for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. Oral levoketoconazole may have a lower risk of liver toxicity than oral ketoconazole. == Veterinary use == Ketoconazole is sometimes prescribed as an antifungal by veterinarians for use in pets, often as unflavored tablets that may need to be cut to smaller size for correct dosage. == References ==""), 'MEDICAL')"	WIKIPEDIA	Ketoconazole, sold under the brand name Nizoral, among others, is an antiandrogen, antifungal, and antiglucocorticoid medication used to treat a number of fungal infections.

Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat hirsutism and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited precocious puberty. In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism. Ketoconazole has been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. == Contraindications == Oral ketoconazole has various contraindications, such as concomitant use with certain other drugs due to known drug interactions. Other contraindications of oral ketoconazole include liver disease, adrenal insufficiency, and known hypersensitivity to oral ketoconazole. == Side effects == === Gastrointestinal === Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, dry mouth, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, flatulence, tongue discoloration may occur. === Endocrine === The drug may cause adrenal insufficiency so the level of the adrenocortical hormones should be monitored while taking it. Oral ketoconazole at a dosage range of 400 to 2,000 mg/day has been found to result in a rate of gynecomastia of 21%. === Liver === In July 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that taking ketoconazole by mouth can cause severe liver injuries and adrenal gland problems: adrenal insufficiency and worsening of other related to the gland conditions. It recommends oral tablets should not be a first-line treatment for any fungal infection. It should be used for the treatment of certain fungal infections, known as endemic mycoses, only when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or not tolerated. As contraindication it should not be used in people with acute or chronic liver disease. === Hypersensitivity === Anaphylaxis after the first dose may occur. Other cases of hypersensitivity include urticaria. === Topical formulations === The topical formulations have not been associated with liver damage, adrenal problems, or drug interactions. These formulations include creams, shampoos, foams, and gels applied to the skin, unlike the ketoconazole tablets, which are taken by mouth. === Pregnancy === Ketoconazole is categorized as pregnancy category C in the US. Research in animals has shown it to cause teratogenesis when administered in high doses. A subsequent trial in Europe failed to show a risk to infants of mothers receiving ketoconazole. == Overdose == In the event of an overdose of oral ketoconazole, treatment should be supportive and based on symptoms. Activated charcoal may be administered within the first hour following overdose of oral ketoconazole. == Interactions == The concomitant use of the following medications is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone irinotecan, lurasidone, colchicine alprazolam, oral midazolam, oral triazolam felodipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin ergot alkaloids: ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, methylergometrine Others: cisapride, nisoldipine, dofetilide, pimozide And is not recommended: carbamazepine, phenytoin gastric acid suppressants: antacids, antimuscarinics, histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors sucralfate rifampin, rifabutin, isoniazid efavirenz, nevirapine Ritonavir is known for increasing activity of the ketoconazole so it is recommended to reduce dosage. There is also a list of drugs which significantly decrease systemic exposure to the ketoconazole and drugs whose systemic exposure is increased by the ketoconazole. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antifungal activity ==== As an antifungal, ketoconazole is structurally similar to imidazole, and interferes with the fungal synthesis of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, as well as certain enzymes. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 14Î±-demethylase (CYP51A1). This enzyme participates in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from lanosterol to ergosterol. Lower doses of fluconazole and itraconazole are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, as they have been found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes. Resistance to ketoconazole has been observed in a number of clinical fungal isolates, including Candida albicans. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. Multidrug-resistance (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family. ==== Antihormonal activity ==== As an antiandrogen, ketoconazole operates through at least two mechanisms of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 40 mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading to a reduction in circulating testosterone levels. It produces this effect through inhibition of 17Î±-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of steroids, including the precursors of testosterone. Due to its efficacy at reducing systemic androgen levels, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Second, ketoconazole is an androgen receptor antagonist, competing with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to the androgen receptor. This effect is thought to be quite weak however, even with high oral doses of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole, along with miconazole, has been found to act as an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor. Ketoconazole is a racemic mixture consisting of cis-(2S,4R)-(âˆ’) and cis-(2R,4S)-(+) enantiomers. The cis-(2S,4R) isomer was more potent in inhibiting progesterone 17Î±,20-lyase than its enantiomer (IC50 values of 0.05 and 2.38 Î¼M, respectively) and in inhibiting 11Î²-hydroxylase (IC50 values of 0.152 and 0.608 Î¼M, respectively). Both isomers were relatively weak inhibitors of human placental aromatase. Oral ketoconazole has been used clinically as a steroidogenesis inhibitor in men, women, and children at dosages of 200 to 1,200 mg/day. Numerous small studies have investigated the effects of oral ketoconazole on hormone levels in humans. It has been found in men to significantly decrease testosterone and estradiol levels and to significantly increase luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone levels, whereas levels of androstenedione, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were unaffected. The ratio of testosterone to estradiol is also decreased during oral ketoconazole therapy in men. Suppression of testosterone levels by ketoconazole is generally partial and has often been found to be transient. Better effects on suppression of testosterone levels have been observed in men when ketoconazole is combined with a GnRH agonist to suppress the hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“gonadal axis, which prevents compensatory upregulation of luteinizing hormone secretion and consequent activation of gonadal testosterone production. In premenopausal women with polycystic ovary syndrome, ketoconazole has been found to significantly decrease levels of androstenedione and testosterone and significantly increase levels of 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone and estradiol. Studies in postmenopausal women with breast cancer have found that ketoconazole significantly decreases androstenedione levels, slightly decreases estradiol levels, and does not affect estrone levels. This indicates minimal inhibition of aromatase by ketoconazole in vivo in humans. Ketoconazole has also been found to decrease levels of endogenous corticosteroids, such as cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone, as well as vitamin D. Ketoconazole has been found to displace dihydrotestosterone and estradiol from sex hormone-binding globulin in vitro, but this was not found to be relevant in vivo. ==== Other activities ==== Ketoconazole has been found to inhibit the activity of the cation channel TRPM5. === Pharmacokinetics === When administered orally, ketoconazole is best absorbed at highly acidic levels, so antacids or other causes of decreased stomach acid levels will lower the drug's absorption. Absorption can be increased by taking it with an acidic beverage, such as cola. Ketoconazole is very lipophilic and tends to accumulate in fatty tissues. == Chemistry == Ketoconazole is a synthetic imidazole. It is a nonsteroidal compound. It is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, levoketoconazole ((2S,4R)-(âˆ’)-ketoconazole) and dextroketoconazole ((2R,4S)-(+)-ketoconazole). Levoketoconazole is under development for potential clinical use as a steroidogenesis inhibitor with better tolerability and less toxicity than ketoconazole. Other steroidogenesis inhibitors besides ketoconazole and levoketoconazole include the nonsteroidal compound aminoglutethimide and the steroidal compound abiraterone acetate. == History == Ketoconazole was discovered in 1976 at Janssen Pharmaceuticals. It was patented in 1977, followed by introduction in the United States in July 1981. Following its introduction, ketoconazole was the only systemic antifungal available for almost a decade. Ketoconazole was introduced as the prototypical medication of the imidazole group of antifungals. Oral ketoconazole has been replaced with oral fluconazole or itraconazole for many mycoses. Due to incidence of serious liver toxicity, the use of oral ketoconazole was suspended in France in July 2011, following review. This event triggered an evaluation of oral ketoconazole throughout the rest of the European Union. In 2013, oral ketoconazole was withdrawn in the European Union and Australia, and strict restrictions were placed on the use of oral ketoconazole in the United States and Canada. Oral ketoconazole is indicated for use in these countries when the indication is a severe or life-threatening systemic infection and alternatives are unavailable. However, topical ketoconazole, which does not distribute systemically, is safe and widely used still. Ketoconazole HRA was approved for use in the European Union for treatment of Cushing's syndrome in November 2013. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Ketoconazole is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Ketoconazole has been marketed under a large number of brand names. === Availability === Ketoconazole is available widely throughout the world. In 2013, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that a ban be imposed on the use of oral ketoconazole for systemic use in humans throughout the European Union, after concluding that the risk of serious liver injury from systemic ketoconazole outweighs its benefits. == Research == As of March 2019, oral levoketoconazole (developmental code name COR-003, tentative brand name Recorlev) is phase III clinical trials for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. Oral levoketoconazole may have a lower risk of liver toxicity than oral ketoconazole. == Veterinary use == Ketoconazole is sometimes prescribed as an antifungal by veterinarians for use in pets, often as unflavored tablets that may need to be cut to smaller size for correct dosage. == References ==	16271	MEDICAL	True

As a first-generation antihistamine, it typically crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier into the brain, thereby producing a suite of sedative and hypnotic effects that are mediated by the central nervous system. (N.b.: An agonist is a molecule that activates certain receptors (i.e., specific cellular proteins) in a cell to produce a specific pharmacological response, causing the cell to modify its activityâ€”while an inverse agonist targets the same receptors as those of a given agonist, but causes a response opposite to that caused by the agonist. An antagonist blocks the action of a given agonist.) Doxylamine is also a potent anticholinergic, meaning that it causes delirum at high dosesâ€”i.e., at much higher doses than recommended. (Specifically it is an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M1 through M5.) These sedative and deliriant effects have in some cases led to using the drug recreationally. Doxylamine was first described in 1948 or 1949. == Medical uses == Doxylamine is an antihistamine used to treat sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, hives, skin rash, itching, and other cold or allergy symptoms. It is also used as a short-term treatment for insomnia. === Insomnia === The first-generation sedating antihistamines diphenhydramine, doxepin, doxylamine, and pyrilamine are the most widely used medications in the world for preventing and treating insomnia. As of 2004, doxylamine and diphenhydramine, which are both over-the-counter medications, were the agents most commonly used to treat short-term insomnia. As of 2008 and 2017, over-the-counter antihistamines were not recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for treatment of chronic insomnia ""due to the relative lack of efficacy and safety data"". Neither version of their guidelines explicitly included or mentioned doxylamine, although diphenhydramine was discussed. A 2015 systematic review of over-the-counter sleep aids including doxylamine found little evidence to inform the use of doxylamine for treatment of insomnia. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found that doxylamine had an effect size (standardized mean difference (SMD)) against placebo for treatment of insomnia at 4 weeks of 0.47 (95% CITooltip confidence interval 0.06 to 0.89). The certainty of evidence was rated as moderate. No data were available for doxylamine in terms of longer-term treatment (3 months). For comparison, the other sedating medicines assessed, doxepin and trimipramine (both of which are tricyclic antidepressants) had effect sizes (SMD) at 4 weeks of 0.30 (95% CI â€“0.05 to 0.64) (very low certainty evidence) and 0.55 (95% CI â€“0.11 to 1.21) (very low certainty evidence), respectively. Doses of doxylamine that have been used for sleep range from 5 to 50 mg, with 25 mg being the typical dose. === Morning sickness === Doxylamine is used in the combination drug pyridoxine/doxylamine to treat morning sickness (nausea and vomiting of pregnancy). It is the only medication approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of morning sickness. === Available forms === Doxylamine is used medically as doxylamine succinate, the succinate salt of doxylamine, and is available both alone (brand names Decapryn, Doxy-Sleep-Aid, Unisom) and in combination with pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) (brand names Bendectin, Bonjesta, Diclegis). Doxylamine is available alone as immediate-release oral tablets containing 25 mg doxylamine succinate. Oral tablets containing 12.5 mg doxylamine succinate as well as oral capsules containing 25 mg doxylamine succinate were also previously available but were discontinued. The combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine is available in the form of extended- and delayed-release oral tablets containing 10 to 20 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 to 20 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride. Doxylamine alone is available over-the-counter, whereas doxylamine in combination with pyridoxine is a prescription-only medication. Doxylamine is also available in over-the-counter nighttime cold medicine products such as NyQuil Cold & Flu (contains acetaminophen, doxylamine succinate 6.25 to 12.5 mg, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide), where it serves as the sedating component. == Contraindications == The fetal safety rating of doxylamine is ""A"" (no evidence of risk). == Side effects == Side effects of doxylamine include dizziness, drowsiness, and dry mouth, among others. Doxylamine is a potent anticholinergic and has a side-effect profile common to such drugs, including blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, muscle incoordination, urinary retention, mental confusion, and delirium. Because of its relatively long elimination half-life (10â€“12 hours), doxylamine is associated with next-day effects including sedation, drowsiness, grogginess, dry mouth, and tiredness when used as a hypnotic. This may be described as a ""hangover effect"". The shorter elimination half-life of diphenhydramine (4â€“8 hours) compared to doxylamine may give it an advantage over doxylamine as a sleep aid in this regard. Antihistamines like doxylamine are sedating initially but tolerance occurs with repeated use and can result in rebound insomnia upon discontinuation. Occasional case reports of coma and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with doxylamine. This is in contrast to diphenhydramine. Studies of doxylamine\'s carcinogenicity in mice and rats have produced positive results for both liver and thyroid cancer, especially in the mouse. The carcinogenicity of the drug in humans is not well-studied, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer lists the drug as ""not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans"". Continuous and/or cumulative use of anticholinergic medications, including first-generation antihistamines, is associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older people. == Overdose == Doxylamine is generally safe for administration to healthy adults. Doses of doxylamine of up to 1,600 mg/day for 6 months have been given to adults with schizophrenia, with little toxicity encountered. The median lethal dose (LD50) is estimated to be 50â€“500 mg/kg in humans. Symptoms of overdose may include dry mouth, dilated pupils, insomnia, night terrors, euphoria, hallucinations, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and death. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose. These have been characterized by coma, tonic-clonic (or grand mal) seizures and cardiopulmonary arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiopulmonary arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3-year-old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. Rarely, an overdose results in rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Doxylamine acts primarily as an antagonist or inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. This action is responsible for its antihistamine and sedative properties. To a lesser extent, doxylamine acts as an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, an action responsible for its anticholinergic and (at high doses) deliriant effects. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of doxylamine is 24.7% for oral administration and 70.8% for intranasal administration. The Tmax of doxylamine is 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Its elimination half-life is 10 to 12 hours (range 7 to 15 hours). Doxylamine is metabolized in the liver primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9. The main metabolites are N-desmethyldoxylamine, N,N-didesmethyldoxylamine, and doxylamine N-oxide. Doxylamine is eliminated 60% in the urine and 40% in feces. == Chemistry == Doxylamine is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistamines. Other antihistamines from this group include bromodiphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clemastine, dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, orphenadrine, and phenyltoloxamine. == History == Doxylamine is a first-generation antihistamine and was discovered by Nathan Sperber and colleagues and was first reported in 1948 or 1949. It has been the antihistamine component of NyQuil since 1966. Bendectin, a combination of doxylamine, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and dicyclomine (an anticholinergic antispasmodic agent), was marketed for treatment of morning sickness in 1956. This product was reformulated in 1976 to remove dicyclomine. The reformulated product was voluntarily discontinued by the manufacturer in the United States in 1983 due to concerns about an alleged association with congenital limb defects. However, these concerns have not been supported by studies. In 2013, doxylamine/pyridoxine was reintroduced in the United States under the brand name Diclegis. The combination was not removed from the market in Canada, where it had been marketed since 1979. == Society and culture == === Formulations === Doxylamine is primarily used as the succinic acid salt, doxylamine succinate. It is the sedating ingredient of NyQuil (generally in combination with dextromethorphan and acetaminophen). In Commonwealth countries, such as Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, doxylamine is available prepared with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and codeine under the brand name Dolased, Propain Plus, Syndol, or Mersyndol, as treatment for tension headache and other types of pain. Doxylamine succinate is used in general over-the-counter sleep-aids branded as Somnil (South Africa), Dozile, Donormyl, LidÃ¨ne (France, Russian Federation), Dormidina (Spain, Portugal), Restavit, Unisom-2, Sominar (Thailand), Sleep Aid (generic, Australia) and Dorminox (Poland). In the United States: Doxylamine succinate is the active ingredient in many over-the-counter sleep aids branded under various names. Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) are the ingredients of Diclegis, approved by the FDA in April 2013 becoming the only drug approved for morning sickness with a class A safety rating for pregnancy (no evidence of risk). In Canada: Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) are the ingredients of Diclectin, which is used to prevent morning sickness. It is also available in combination with vitamin B6 and folic acid under the brand name Evanorm (marketed by Ion Healthcare). In India Doxylamine preparations are available typically in combination with pyridoxine which may also contain folic acid. Doxylamine usage is thus restricted for pregnant women. == References =='), 'MEDICAL')"	WIKIPEDIA	"Doxylamine is an antihistamine medication used to treat insomnia and allergies, andâ€”in combination with pyridoxine (vitamin B6)â€”to treat morning sickness in pregnant women.

It is either taken by mouth or applied to the skin as a cream or ointment. The cream and ointment should not be used for fungal nail infections. Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, diarrhea, headache, cough, rash, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. Liver injury is, however, unusual. Oral use during pregnancy is not typically recommended. The cream and ointment may result in itchiness but are generally well tolerated. Terbinafine is in the allylamines family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to synthesize ergosterol. It appears to result in fungal cell death. Terbinafine was discovered in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 255th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Terbinafine is mainly effective on molds of the order Onygenales and some yeasts in the genus Candida. As a cream or powder, it is used topically for superficial skin infections such as jock itch (tinea cruris), athlete's foot (tinea pedis), and other types of ringworm (tinea corporis). Tablets by mouth are often prescribed for the treatment of onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection, typically by a dermatophyte or Candida species. Fungal nail infections are located deep under the nail in the cuticle to which topically applied treatments are unable to penetrate in sufficient amounts. The tablets may, rarely, cause hepatotoxicity, so patients are warned of this and may be monitored with liver function tests. Alternatives to oral administration have been studied. Terbinafine may induce or exacerbate subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Persons with lupus erythematosus should first discuss possible risks with their doctor before initiation of therapy. == Side effects == Many side effects and adverse drug reactions have been reported with oral terbinafine hydrochloride, possibly due to its extensive biodistribution and the often extended durations involved in antifungal treatment (longer than two months). A comprehensive list of adverse events associated with terbinafine use includes: Gastrointestinal problems: Diarrhea, constipation, nausea, fullness, abdominal pain, indigestion, dyspepsia, gastritis, cholestasis, flatulence, altered stool colour, abdominal muscular pain Central nervous system or neurological problems: Headaches, dizziness, vertigo, light-headedness, decreased concentration levels, paraesthesia (pins and needles) Hepatic problems: Raised liver enzyme levels, liver inflammation (hepatitis), liver damage, liver failure Immune system problems: Decreased white blood cell counts including pancytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and neutropenia, autoimmune reactions such as lupus erythematosus Psychological problems: Depression, anxiety, insomnia, increased or unusual dream activity, malaise Sensory problems: Complete loss of taste (ageusia), decreased taste (hypogeusia) and distorted taste (dysgeusia), often involving a metallic taste sensation and dry mouth, visual disturbances including blurred vision, green vision and double vision. In extremely rare cases, the loss or impairment of taste is permanent Skin problems: Rashes, hives (urticaria), skin irritation, itching, jaundice, Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome Other side effects: Fatigue, increased heart rate (tachycardia), hair loss (alopecia), decreased red blood cell count (anemia), muscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia) In 2015, physicians reported that a patient with an MTHFR enzyme mutation (specifically the C677T variant) had developed an adverse reaction to terbinafine (Lamisil) (headache, fatigue, and dizziness). Genetic testing revealed the MTHFR C677T mutation. It was noted that Lamisil interferes with the methylation cycle and that this can cause side effects in individuals with the MTHFR C677T mutation. == Pharmacology == Like other allylamines, terbinafine inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of squalene to lanosterol. In fungi, lanosterol is then converted to ergosterol; in humans, lanosterol becomes cholesterol. However, as fungi and animals diverged around 1.1 billion years ago - there is enough difference in this enzyme that terbinafine preferentially binds fungal squalene epoxidase, making it selective for inhibiting ergosterol production in fungi without significantly affecting cholesterol production in mammals. This is thought to fatally disrupt the fungal cell membrane. Terbinafine is highly lipophilic and tends to accumulate in hair, skin, nails, and fat cells. This accumulation results in therapeutic levels of terbinafine even after 80 days following one week treatment of 250 mg/day. Different dosing schedules have been proposed such as 500 mg/day for one week or 250 mg/day for two weeks each followed by a drug-free period of two or three weeks, totaling 3 months of treatment including the drug-free periods. Such intermittent dosing schedules appear to be as effective as continuous regimens. == Chemistry == Terbinafine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol and dichloromethane, soluble in ethanol, and slightly soluble in water. Terbinafine is produced from olefin metathesis of 1,3-dichloropropene and neohexene followed by reaction with N-methyl-1-naphthalenemethanamine. Despite its name it does not contain terbium. == History == Terbinafine first became available in Europe in 1991 and in the United States in 1996. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first generic versions of prescription Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) tablets. The remaining patent or exclusivity for Lamisil expired on June 30, 2007. On September 28, 2007, the FDA stated that terbinafine is now approved for use by children age four and up. The antifungal granules can be sprinkled on a child's food to treat scalp fungus. In the United States the price in 1999 was $547 for a 12-week course; this fell to $10 by 2015, after the patent had expired. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Terbinafine is sold in India as Terboderm by Omega Pharma and Tyza (Abbott Healthcare).

AzA inhibits tyrosinase. == Production == Azelaic acid is industrially produced by the ozonolysis of oleic acid. The side product is nonanoic acid. It is produced naturally by Malassezia furfur (also known as Pityrosporum ovale), a yeast that lives on normal skin. The bacterial degradation of nonanoic acid gives azelaic acid. == Biological function == === Plants biology === In plants, azelaic acid serves as a ""distress flare"" involved in defense responses after infection. It serves as a signal that induces the accumulation of salicylic acid, an important component of a plant\'s defensive response. === Human biology === The mechanism of action in humans is thought to be through the inhibition of hyperactive protease activity that converts cathelicidin into the antimicrobial skin peptide LL-37. == Applications == === Polymers and related materials === Esters of this dicarboxylic acid find applications in lubrication and plasticizers.

Azelaic acid is used to treat mild to moderate acne, both comedonal acne and inflammatory acne. It belongs to a class of chemicals called dicarboxylic acids. It works by killing acne bacteria that infect skin pores. It also decreases the production of keratin, which is a natural substance that promotes the growth of acne bacteria. Azelaic acid is also used as a topical gel treatment for rosacea, due to its ability to reduce inflammation. It clears the bumps and swelling caused by rosacea.

Tryptophan contains an Î±-amino group, an Î±-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a polar molecule with a non-polar aromatic beta carbon substituent. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3 (niacin). It is encoded by the codon UGG. Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (â€“NH+3; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( â€“COOâˆ’; pKa = 2.38). Humans and many animals cannot synthesize tryptophan: they need to obtain it through their diet, making it an essential amino acid. Tryptophan is named after the digestive enzymes trypsin, which were used in its first isolation from casein proteins. It was assigned the one-letter symbol W based on the double ring being visually suggestive to the bulky letter. == Function == Amino acids, including tryptophan, are used as building blocks in protein biosynthesis, and proteins are required to sustain life. Tryptophan is among the less common amino acids found in proteins, but it plays important structural or functional roles whenever it occurs. For instance, tryptophan and tyrosine residues play special roles in ""anchoring"" membrane proteins within the cell membrane. Tryptophan, along with other aromatic amino acids, is also important in glycan-protein interactions. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds: Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase. Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes. Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids. Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan. The disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression. In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop, and when the cell\'s tryptophan levels go down again, transcription from the trp operon resumes. This permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell\'s internal and external tryptophan levels. == Recommended dietary allowance == In 2002, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5 mg/kg body weight/day of tryptophan for adults 19 years and over. === Dietary sources === Tryptophan is present in most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan, the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry. == Medical use == === Depression === Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. In 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors\' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that ""the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive"" and note that ""because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present"". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence. === Insomnia === The American Academy of Sleep Medicine\'s 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of tryptophan in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness. == Side effects == Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). == Interactions == Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs. Because tryptophan supplementation has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, its interactions with other drugs are not well known. == Isolation == The isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901. Hopkins recovered tryptophan from hydrolysed casein, recovering 4â€“8 g of tryptophan from 600 g of crude casein. == Biosynthesis and industrial production == As an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins. Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerol phosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine. The industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified bacteria such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, C. glutamicum or E. coli. These strains carry mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase. == Society and culture == === Showa Denko contamination scandal === There was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit. Subsequent studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko\'s L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. However, other evidence suggests that tryptophan itself may be a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. There are also claims that a precursor reached sufficient concentrations to form a toxic dimer. The FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005. The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of L-tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been cited as evidence of a need for ""close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products"". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech. === Turkey meat and drowsiness hypothesis === A common assertion in the US and the UK is that heavy consumption of turkey meatâ€”as seen during Thanksgiving and Christmasâ€”results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable with that of other meats. Drowsiness after eating may be caused by other foods eaten with the turkey, particularly carbohydrates. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan, into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in more uptake of tryptophan across the bloodâ€“brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into the hormone melatoninâ€”which is an important mediator of the circadian rhythmâ€”by the pineal gland. Hence, these data suggest that ""feast-induced drowsiness""â€”or postprandial somnolenceâ€”may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which indirectly increases the production of melatonin in the brain, and thereby promotes sleep. == Research == === Yeast amino acid metabolism === In 1912 Felix Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast metabolizes the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol. === Serotonin precursor === Tryptophan affects brain serotonin synthesis when given orally in a purified form and is used to modify serotonin levels for research. Low brain serotonin level is induced by administration of tryptophan-poor protein in a technique called acute tryptophan depletion. Studies using this method have evaluated the effect of serotonin on mood and social behavior, finding that serotonin reduces aggression and increases agreeableness. === Psychedelic effects === Tryptophan produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at sufficiently high doses. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects. Tryptophan is converted into the trace amine tryptamine and tryptamine is N-methylated by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) into N-methyltryptamine (NMT) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT), which are known serotonergic psychedelics. === Fluorescence === Tryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of the microenvironment around the tryptophan residue.

Tryptophan contains an Î±-amino group, an Î±-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a polar molecule with a non-polar aromatic beta carbon substituent. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3 (niacin). It is encoded by the codon UGG. Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (â€“NH+3; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( â€“COOâˆ’; pKa = 2.38). Humans and many animals cannot synthesize tryptophan: they need to obtain it through their diet, making it an essential amino acid. Tryptophan is named after the digestive enzymes trypsin, which were used in its first isolation from casein proteins. It was assigned the one-letter symbol W based on the double ring being visually suggestive to the bulky letter. == Function == Amino acids, including tryptophan, are used as building blocks in protein biosynthesis, and proteins are required to sustain life. Tryptophan is among the less common amino acids found in proteins, but it plays important structural or functional roles whenever it occurs. For instance, tryptophan and tyrosine residues play special roles in ""anchoring"" membrane proteins within the cell membrane. Tryptophan, along with other aromatic amino acids, is also important in glycan-protein interactions. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds: Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase. Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes. Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids. Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan. The disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression. In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop, and when the cell's tryptophan levels go down again, transcription from the trp operon resumes. This permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell's internal and external tryptophan levels. == Recommended dietary allowance == In 2002, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5 mg/kg body weight/day of tryptophan for adults 19 years and over. === Dietary sources === Tryptophan is present in most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan, the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry. == Medical use == === Depression === Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. In 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that ""the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive"" and note that ""because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present"". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence. === Insomnia === The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of tryptophan in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness. == Side effects == Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). == Interactions == Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs. Because tryptophan supplementation has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, its interactions with other drugs are not well known. == Isolation == The isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901. Hopkins recovered tryptophan from hydrolysed casein, recovering 4â€“8 g of tryptophan from 600 g of crude casein. == Biosynthesis and industrial production == As an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins. Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerol phosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine. The industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified bacteria such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, C. glutamicum or E. coli. These strains carry mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase. == Society and culture == === Showa Denko contamination scandal === There was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit. Subsequent studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko's L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. However, other evidence suggests that tryptophan itself may be a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. There are also claims that a precursor reached sufficient concentrations to form a toxic dimer. The FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005. The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of L-tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been cited as evidence of a need for ""close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products"". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech. === Turkey meat and drowsiness hypothesis === A common assertion in the US and the UK is that heavy consumption of turkey meatâ€”as seen during Thanksgiving and Christmasâ€”results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable with that of other meats. Drowsiness after eating may be caused by other foods eaten with the turkey, particularly carbohydrates. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan, into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in more uptake of tryptophan across the bloodâ€“brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into the hormone melatoninâ€”which is an important mediator of the circadian rhythmâ€”by the pineal gland. Hence, these data suggest that ""feast-induced drowsiness""â€”or postprandial somnolenceâ€”may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which indirectly increases the production of melatonin in the brain, and thereby promotes sleep. == Research == === Yeast amino acid metabolism === In 1912 Felix Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast metabolizes the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol. === Serotonin precursor === Tryptophan affects brain serotonin synthesis when given orally in a purified form and is used to modify serotonin levels for research. Low brain serotonin level is induced by administration of tryptophan-poor protein in a technique called acute tryptophan depletion. Studies using this method have evaluated the effect of serotonin on mood and social behavior, finding that serotonin reduces aggression and increases agreeableness. === Psychedelic effects === Tryptophan produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at sufficiently high doses. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects.

49	24895	Acarbose	['ACARBOSE-unclear if this is accurate']	"(('WIKIPEDIA', 'Acarbose (INN) is an anti-diabetic drug used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2 and, in some countries, prediabetes. It is a generic sold in Europe and China as Glucobay (Bayer AG), in North America as Precose (Bayer Pharmaceuticals), and in Canada as Prandase (Bayer AG). Acarbose is a starch blocker. It works by inhibiting alpha glucosidase, an intestinal enzyme that releases glucose from larger carbohydrates such as starch and sucrose. It is composed of an acarviosin moiety with a maltose at the reducing terminus. It can be degraded by a number of gut bacteria. Acarbose is cheap and popular in China, but not in the U.S. One physician explains that use in the U.S. is limited because it is not potent enough to justify the side effects of diarrhea and flatulence. However, a large study concluded in 2013 that ""acarbose is effective, safe and well tolerated in a large cohort of Asian patients with type 2 diabetes."" A possible explanation for the differing opinions is an observation that acarbose is significantly more effective in patients eating a relatively high-starch Eastern diet. == Medical uses == === Efficacy === In type II diabetic patients, acarbose averages an absolute decrease of 0.8 percentage points in HbA1c, which is a decrease of about 10% in typical HbA1c values in diabetes studies. Individuals with higher baseline levels show higher reductions, about an 0.12% additional decrease for each point of baseline HbA1c. Its effect on postprandial glucose, but not on HbA1c, scales with dose. Among diabetic patients, acarbose may help reduce the damage done to blood vessels and kidneys by reducing glucose levels. A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in people with prediabetes, defined as impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). It was found that acarbose reduced the incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2 when compared to placebo, however there was no conclusive evidence that acarbose, when compared to diet and exercise, metformin, placebo, or no intervention, improved all-cause mortality, reduced or increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, serious or non-serious adverse events, non-fatal stroke, congestive heart failure, or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Several studies showed that glucosidase inhibitors and alpha-amylase inhibitors promote loss of visceral fat and waist by acting as calorie restriction mimetics (linked to its acarbose-like action). === Combination therapy === The combination of acarbose with metformin results in greater reductions of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and post-prandial glucose than either agent alone. == Adverse effects == Since acarbose prevents the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, some carbohydrate will remain in the intestine and be delivered to the colon. In the colon, bacteria digest (ferment) the complex carbohydrates, causing gastrointestinal side-effects such as flatulence (78% of patients) and diarrhea (14% of patients). Since these effects are dose-related, in general it is advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount. One study found that gastrointestinal side effects decreased significantly (from 50% to 15%) over 24 weeks, even on constant dosing. Sucrose is more likely to trigger GI side effects compared to starch. Acarbose is associated with very rare elevated transaminases (19 out of 500,000). Even rarer cases of hepatitis has been reported with acarbose use. It usually goes away when the medicine is stopped. Liver enzymes should be checked before and during use of this medicine as a precaution. A 2016 meta-analysis confirms that alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, including acarbose, have a statistically significant link to elevated transaminase levels. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Acarbose inhibits enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) needed to digest carbohydrates, specifically, alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines, and pancreatic alpha-amylase. It locks up the enzymes by mimicking the transition state of the substrate with its amine linkage. However, bacterial alpha-amylases from gut microbiome are able to degrade acarbose. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, whereas the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels; the long-term effect is a reduction in HbA1c level. === Metabolism === Acarbose degradation is the unique feature of glycoside hydrolases in gut microbiota, acarbose degrading glucosidase, which hydrolyze acarbose into an acarviosine-glucose and glucose. Human enzymes do transform acarbose: the pancreatic alpha-amylase is able to perform a rearrangement reaction, moving the glucose unit in the ""tail"" maltose to the ""head"" of the molecule. Analog drugs with the ""tail"" glucose removed or flipped to an Î±(1-6) linkage resist this transformation. It has been reported that the maltogenic alpha-amylase from Thermus sp. IM6501 (ThMA) and a cyclodextrinase (CDase) from Streptococcus pyogenes could hydrolyse acarbose to glucose and acarviosine-glucose, ThMA can further hydrolyze acarviosine-glucose into acarviosin and glucose. A cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase) from gut bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum degraded acarbose via two different modes of action to produce maltose and acarviosin, as well as glucose and acarviosine-glucose, suggest that acarbose resistance is caused by the human microbiome. The microbiome-derived acarbose kinases are also specific to phosphorylate and inactivate acarbose. The molecular modeling showed the interaction between gut bacterial acarbose degrading glucosidase and human Î±-amylase. == Natural distribution == In nature, acarbose is synthesized by soil bacteria Actinoplanes sp through its precursor valienamine. And acarbose is also degraded by gut bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum and soil bacteria Thermus sp by acarbose degrading glucosidases. == In molecular biology == Acarbose is described chemically as a pseudotetrasaccharide, specifically a maltotetraose mimic inhibitor. As an inhibitor that mimics some natural substrates, it is useful for elucidating the structure of sugar-digesting enzymes, by binding into the same pocket. == Research == Most studies investigating alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity use acarbose as reference. In human T2DM patients, acarbose reduces total triglyceride levels. Acarbose has a similar effect in non-T2DM patients with isolated familial hypertriglyceridemia. In smaller samples of healthy human volunteers, acarbose increases postprandial GLP-1 levels.

It is a conditionally essential amino acid with a polar side group. The word ""tyrosine"" is from the Greek tyrÃ³s, meaning cheese, as it was first discovered in 1846 by German chemist Justus von Liebig in the protein casein from cheese. It is called tyrosyl when referred to as a functional group or side chain. While tyrosine is generally classified as a hydrophobic amino acid, it is more hydrophilic than phenylalanine. It is encoded by the codons UAC and UAU in messenger RNA. The one-letter symbol Y was assigned to tyrosine for being alphabetically nearest of those letters available. Note that T was assigned to the structurally simpler threonine, U was avoided for its similarity with V for valine, W was assigned to tryptophan, while X was reserved for undetermined or atypical amino acids. The mnemonic tYrosine was also proposed. == Functions == Aside from being a proteinogenic amino acid, tyrosine has a special role by virtue of the phenol functionality. Its hydroxy group is able to form the ester linkage, with phosphate in particular. Phosphate groups are transferred to tyrosine residues by way of protein kinases. This is one of the post-translational modifications. Phosphorylated tyrosine occurs in proteins that are part of signal transduction processes. Similar functionality is also presented in serine and threonine, whose side chains have a hydroxy group, but are alcohols. Phosphorylation of these three amino acids\' moieties (including tyrosine) creates a negative charge on their ends, that is greater than the negative charge of the only negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acids. Phosphorylated proteins keep these same propertiesâ€”which are useful for more reliable protein-protein interactionsâ€”by means of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Binding sites for a signalling phosphoprotein may be diverse in their chemical structure. Phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group can change the activity of the target protein, or may form part of a signaling cascade via SH2 domain binding. A tyrosine residue also plays an important role in photosynthesis. In chloroplasts (photosystem II), it acts as an electron donor in the reduction of oxidized chlorophyll. In this process, it loses the hydrogen atom of its phenolic OH-group. This radical is subsequently reduced in the photosystem II by the four core manganese clusters. == Dietary requirements and sources == The Dietary Reference Intake for tyrosine is usually estimated together with phenylalanine. It varies depending on an estimate method, however the ideal proportion of these two amino acids is considered to be 60:40 (phenylalanine:tyrosine) as a human body has such composition. Tyrosine, which can also be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine, is found in many high-protein food products such as meat, fish, cheese, cottage cheese, milk, yogurt, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soy protein and lima beans. For example, the white of an egg has about 250 mg per egg, while beef, lamb, pork, tuna, salmon, chicken, and turkey contain about 500â€“1000 mg per 3 ounces (85 g) portion. == Biosynthesis == In plants and most microorganisms, tyrosine is produced via prephenate, an intermediate on the shikimate pathway. Prephenate is oxidatively decarboxylated with retention of the hydroxyl group to give p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is transaminated using glutamate as the nitrogen source to give tyrosine and Î±-ketoglutarate. Mammals synthesize tyrosine from the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), which is derived from food. The conversion of Phe to Tyr is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of phenylalanine, such that it becomes tyrosine. == Metabolism == === Phosphorylation and sulfation === Some of the tyrosine residues can be tagged (at the hydroxyl group) with a phosphate group (phosphorylated) by protein kinases. In its phosphorylated form, tyrosine is called phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the key steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity. Phosphotyrosine can be detected through specific antibodies. Tyrosine residues may also be modified by the addition of a sulfate group, a process known as tyrosine sulfation. Tyrosine sulfation is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST). Like the phosphotyrosine antibodies mentioned above, antibodies have recently been described that specifically detect sulfotyrosine. === Precursor to neurotransmitters and hormones === In dopaminergic cells in the brain, tyrosine is converted to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine can then be converted into other catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in the colloid of the thyroid are also derived from tyrosine. === Precursor to other compounds === The latex of Papaver somniferum, the opium poppy, has been shown to convert tyrosine into the alkaloid morphine and the bio-synthetic pathway has been established from tyrosine to morphine by using Carbon-14 radio-labelled tyrosine to trace the in-vivo synthetic route.Tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) is an enzyme in the natural phenols biosynthesis pathway. It transforms L-tyrosine into p-coumaric acid. Tyrosine is also the precursor to the pigment melanin. Tyrosine (or its precursor phenylalanine) is needed to synthesize the benzoquinone structure which forms part of coenzyme Q10. === Degradation === The decomposition of L-tyrosine (syn. para-hydroxyphenylalanine) begins with an Î±-ketoglutarate dependent transamination through the tyrosine transaminase to para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The positional description para, abbreviated p, mean that the hydroxyl group and side chain on the phenyl ring are across from each other (see the illustration below). The next oxidation step catalyzes by p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and splitting off CO2 homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-1-acetate). In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase is required. Thereby, through the incorporation of a further O2 molecule, maleylacetoacetate is created. Fumarylacetoacetate is created by maleylacetoacetate cis-trans-isomerase through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation. This cis-trans-isomerase contains glutathione as a coenzyme. Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split by the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase through the addition of a water molecule. Thereby fumarate (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and acetoacetate (3-ketobutyroate) are liberated. Acetoacetate is a ketone body, which is activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter it can be converted into acetyl-CoA, which in turn can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle or be used for fatty acid synthesis. Phloretic acid is also a urinary metabolite of tyrosine in rats. == Ortho- and meta-tyrosine == Three structural isomers of L-tyrosine are known. In addition to the common amino acid L-tyrosine, which is the para isomer (para-tyr, p-tyr or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine), there are two additional regioisomers, namely meta-tyrosine (also known as 3-hydroxyphenylalanine, L-m-tyrosine, and m-tyr) and ortho-tyrosine (o-tyr or 2-hydroxyphenylalanine), that occur in nature. The m-tyr and o-tyr isomers, which are rare, arise through non-enzymatic free-radical hydroxylation of phenylalanine under conditions of oxidative stress. == Medical use == Tyrosine is a precursor to neurotransmitters and increases plasma neurotransmitter levels (particularly dopamine and norepinephrine), but has little if any effect on mood in normal subjects. A 2015 systematic review found that ""tyrosine loading acutely counteracts decrements in working memory and information processing that are induced by demanding situational conditions such as extreme weather or cognitive load"" and therefore ""tyrosine may benefit healthy individuals exposed to demanding situational conditions"". == Industrial synthesis == L-tyrosine is used in pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and food additives. Two methods were formerly used to manufacture L-tyrosine. The first involves the extraction of the desired amino acid from protein hydrolysates using a chemical approach. The second utilizes enzymatic synthesis from phenolics, pyruvate, and ammonia through the use of tyrosine phenol-lyase. Advances in genetic engineering and the advent of industrial fermentation have shifted the synthesis of L-tyrosine to the use of engineered strains of E. coli. == See also == Albinism Alkaptonuria Betalain Iodinated tyrosine derivatives Pauly reaction Tyramine Tyrosine sulfation Tyrosinemia == References == == External links == Tyrosine MS Spectrum Tyrosine metabolism Archived 2019-07-26 at the Wayback Machine Phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis Archived 2021-05-06 at the Wayback Machine'), 'ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE')"	WIKIPEDIA	"L-Tyrosine or tyrosine (symbol Tyr or Y) or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine is one of the 20 standard amino acids that are used by cells to synthesize proteins.

It was discovered in 1966 by M. E. Wall and M. C. Wani in systematic screening of natural products for anticancer drugs. It was isolated from the bark and stem of Camptotheca acuminata (Camptotheca, Happy tree), a tree native to China used in traditional Chinese medicine. It has been used clinically in China for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. CPT showed anticancer activity in preliminary clinical trials, especially against breast, ovarian, colon, lung, and stomach cancers. However, it has low solubility and adverse effects have been reported when used therapeutically, so synthetic and medicinal chemists have developed numerous syntheses of camptothecin and various derivatives to increase the benefits of the chemical, with good results. Four CPT analogues have been approved and are used in cancer chemotherapy today: topotecan, irinotecan, belotecan, and trastuzumab deruxtecan. Camptothecin has also been found in other plants including Chonemorpha fragrans. == Structures == CPT has a planar pentacyclic ring structure, that includes a pyrrolo[3,4-Î²]-quinoline moiety (rings A, B and C), conjugated pyridone moiety (ring D) and one chiral center at position 20 within the alpha-hydroxy lactone ring with (S) configuration (the E-ring). Its planar structure is thought to be one of the most important factors in topoisomerase inhibition. == Binding == CPT binds to the topoisomerase I and DNA complex (the covalent complex) resulting in a ternary complex, and thereby stabilizing it. This prevents DNA re-ligation and therefore causes DNA damage which results in apoptosis. CPT binds both to the enzyme and DNA with hydrogen bonds. The most important part of the structure is the E-ring which interacts from three different positions with the enzyme. The hydroxyl group in position 20 forms hydrogen bond to the side chain on aspartic acid number 533 (Asp533) in the enzyme. It is critical that the configuration of the chiral carbon is (S) because (R) is inactive. The lactone is bonded with two hydrogen bonds to the amino groups on arginine 364 (Arg364). The D-ring interacts with the +1 cytosine on non-cleaved strand and stabilizes the topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complex by forming hydrogen bond. This hydrogen bond is between carbonyl group in position 17 on the D-ring and amino group on the pyrimidine ring of +1 cytosine. CPT is selectively cytotoxic to the cells replicating DNA during S phase and its toxicity is primarily a result of conversion of single-strand breaks into double-strand breaks when the replication fork collides with the cleavage complexes formed by DNA and CPT. == Chemistry == The lactone ring in CPT is highly susceptible to hydrolysis. The open ring form is inactive and it must therefore be closed to inhibit topoisomerase I. The closed form is favored in acidic condition, as it is in many cancer cells microenvironment. CPT is transported into the cell by passive diffusion. Cellular uptake is favored by lipophilicity, which enhances intracellular accumulation. Lipophilicity makes compounds more stable because of improved lactone partitioning into red blood cells and consequently less hydrolysis of the lactone. CPT has affinity for human serum albumin (HSA), especially the carboxylate form of CPT. Because of that, the equilibrium between the lactone ring and the carboxylate form is driven toward the carboxylate. Reduced drug-HSA interactions could result in improved activity. == Structure-activity relationship == Studies have shown that substitution at position 7, 9, 10 and 11 can have positive effect on CPT activity and physical properties, e.g. potency and metabolic stability. Enlargement of the lactone ring by one CH2 unit also enhances its abilities, as in homocamptothecin. Substitution at position 12 and 14 leads to inactive derivative. === A- and B-ring modification === ==== Alkyl substitution ==== Alkyl substitution at position 7 has shown increased cytotoxicity, such as ethyl (C2H5) or chloromethyl (CH2Cl). These groups are able to react with the DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I which leads to more tumor activity. It has also been shown that increasing the length of the carbon chain (in position 7) leads to increased lipophilicity and consequently greater potency and stability in human plasma. Other 7-modified CPT analogues are silatecans and karenitecins. They are potent inhibitors on topoisomerase I and both have alkylsilyl groups in position 7 which make them lipophilic and more stable. Silatecans or 7-silylcampthothecins have shown reduced drug-HSA interactions which contributes to its blood stability and they can also cross the blood brain barrier. DB-67 is a 10-hydroxy derivative and is among the most active silatecans. BNP1350 which belongs to the series of karenitecins exhibits cytotoxic activity and ability to overcome drug resistance. Still another route to make CPT's lipophilic is to introduce lipophilic substituents, such as iminomethyl or oxyiminomethyl moieties. One of the most potent compounds is the oxyiminomethyl derivative ST1481 that has the advantage to overcome drug resistance caused by transport systems. Basic nitrogen in a carbon chain at position 7 makes the compound more hydrophilic and hence more water-soluble. For example, is a derivate called CKD-602, which is a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor and successfully overcomes the poor water solubility and toxicity seen with CPT. Considerably greater activity can be achieved by putting electron-withdrawing groups like amino, nitro, bromo or chloro at position 9 and 10 and hydroxyl group at position 10 or 11. But these compounds are relatively insoluble in aqueous solutions, which causes difficulty in administrations. Methoxy group at both position 10 and 11 simultaneously leads to inactivity. ==== Hexacyclic CPT analogues ==== Hexacyclic CPT analogues have shown great potency. For example, methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy group connected between 10 and 11 form a 5 or 6 membered ring which leads to more water-soluble derivates and increased potency. Researches have shown that ethylenedioxy analogues are less potent than methylenedioxy. The reason is the unfavorable steric interactions of ethylenedioxy analogues with the enzyme. Adding amino or chloro group at 9th position or chloromethyl group at 7th position to these 10, 11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy analogues results in compounds with even greater cytotoxicity but weaker solubility in water. To yield 10, 11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy analogues with good water solubility a good way is to introduce a water solubilising substituent at position 7. Lurtotecan meets those requirements; it's a 10, 11-ethylenedioxy analogue with a 4-methylpiperazino-methylene at position 7 and has shown a great potency in clinical researches. A ring can also be formed between position 7 and 9, like position 10 and 11. That gives new opportunities to make water-soluble derivatives [5]. These hexacyclic CPT become more active when electron-withdrawing groups are put in position 11 and methyl or amino groups at 10. Exatecan is an example of hexacyclic CPT that has a 6 membered ring over position 7 and 9, and is 10-methyl, 11-fluoro substituted [4]. It is water-soluble and more potent than topotecan. === C- and D-ring modification === The C- and D-rings have an essential role in the antitumor activity. Replacement in any position results in much less potent compound than parent compound in other cytotoxicity assay. === E-ring modifications === The E-ring doesn't allow many structural changes without losing CPT activity because it is necessary for binding to the active site of TOP I. One possible replacement is changing the hydroxyl group to Cl, F or Br because their polarizability is sufficient to stabilize the enzyme-complex. Another possible modification is to insert a methylene between hydroxyl and lactone on the E-ring yielding a seven membered Î²-hydroxylactone group, so-called homocamptothecin (hCPT). The hCPT's hydroxyl has less inductive effect on the carboxyl group which makes the lactone very reactive. This enhances the interaction of the free hydroxyl group optimally with topoisomerase I and the covalent complex that forms in its presence are more stable. The E-ring of hCPT opens more slowly and the opening is irreversible. hCPTs exhibit enhanced human plasma stability because of decreased protein binding and more affinity for red blood cells than CPT. == CPT analogues == Since the discovery of CPT many analogues have been synthesized. Below is a schematic view of the CPT analogues that have been mentioned in the text above. CPT is linked to a cyclodextrin-based polymer to form the investigational anti-cancer drug CRLX101. == Biosynthesis == Like all other monoterpenoid indole-alkaloids, biosynthesis of camptothecin requires production of the strictosidine. Strictosidine is synthesized through condensation reaction between tryptamine from shikimate pathway and secologanin from either mevalonate (MVA) pathway or non-mevalonate pathway (MEP). Strictosidine then undergoes intermolecular cyclization to produce strictosamide, which is converted to camptothecin through a series of oxidation reactions by enzymes that still needs to be resolved. The shikimate pathway leading to biosynthesis of tryptamine is mostly understood. First, chorismate is converted to anthranilate by the alpha-subunit of anthranilate synthase (ASA). Anthranilate reacts with 5-phosphoribose pyrophosphate to produce 5-phosphoribosylanthranilate. Then this intermediate is converted to indole glycerol phosphate, which interacts with the alpha-subunit of tryptophan (TSA) synthase to yield indole. The beta-subunit of tryptophan synthase (TSB) catalyzes condensation of indole with serine, leading to tryptophan. In the next step, tryptamine is produced as the result of decarboxylation by tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC). Secologanin synthesis begins with condensation reaction between pyruvate and D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate catalyzed by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) to produce 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP). The conversion of DXP to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which is the common terpenoid biosynthesis precursor involves 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate reductase (HDR). The formation of IPP can be achieved by both MVA and MEP pathways. Condensation of IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) yields geranyl diphosphate (GPP). The geraniol synthase (GS) then converts GPP to geraniol. The conversion of geraniol to secologanin occurs through various enzymatic reactions. Based on studies with radioactive labelling and pathway specific inhibitors, MEP pathway is the primary source for secologanin. Tryptamine from shikimate pathway and secologanin from MVA or MEP pathway are converted to strictosidine through a condensation reaction catalyzed by strictosidine synthase. Although it is not fully resolved, it has been postulated that camptothecin is produced from strictosidine via strictosamide, 3 (S)-pumiloside and 3 (S)-deoxypumiloside. == References ==""), 'MEDICAL')"	WIKIPEDIA	Camptothecin (CPT) is a topoisomerase inhibitor.

The shikimate pathway leading to biosynthesis of tryptamine is mostly understood. First, chorismate is converted to anthranilate by the alpha-subunit of anthranilate synthase (ASA). Anthranilate reacts with 5-phosphoribose pyrophosphate to produce 5-phosphoribosylanthranilate. Then this intermediate is converted to indole glycerol phosphate, which interacts with the alpha-subunit of tryptophan (TSA) synthase to yield indole. The beta-subunit of tryptophan synthase (TSB) catalyzes condensation of indole with serine, leading to tryptophan. In the next step, tryptamine is produced as the result of decarboxylation by tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC). Secologanin synthesis begins with condensation reaction between pyruvate and D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate catalyzed by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) to produce 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP). The conversion of DXP to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which is the common terpenoid biosynthesis precursor involves 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate reductase (HDR). The formation of IPP can be achieved by both MVA and MEP pathways. Condensation of IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) yields geranyl diphosphate (GPP). The geraniol synthase (GS) then converts GPP to geraniol. The conversion of geraniol to secologanin occurs through various enzymatic reactions. Based on studies with radioactive labelling and pathway specific inhibitors, MEP pathway is the primary source for secologanin. Tryptamine from shikimate pathway and secologanin from MVA or MEP pathway are converted to strictosidine through a condensation reaction catalyzed by strictosidine synthase. Although it is not fully resolved, it has been postulated that camptothecin is produced from strictosidine via strictosamide, 3 (S)-pumiloside and 3 (S)-deoxypumiloside. == References ==	11195	MEDICAL	True

primarily to treat prostate cancer. It is also used in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions like acne, excessive hair growth, and high androgen levels in women. It is taken by mouth, usually three times per day. Side effects in men include breast tenderness and enlargement, feminization, sexual dysfunction, and hot flashes. Conversely, the medication has fewer side effects and is better-tolerated in women with the most common side effect being dry skin. Diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes can occur in both sexes. Rarely, flutamide can cause liver damage, lung disease, sensitivity to light, elevated methemoglobin, elevated sulfhemoglobin, and deficient neutrophils. Numerous cases of liver failure and death have been reported, which has limited the use of flutamide. Flutamide acts as a selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), competing with androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to ARs in tissues like the prostate gland. By doing so, it prevents their effects and stops them from stimulating prostate cancer cells to grow. Flutamide is a prodrug to a more active form. Flutamide and its active form stay in the body for a relatively short time, which makes it necessary to take flutamide multiple times per day. Flutamide was first described in 1967 and was first introduced for medical use in 1983. It became available in the United States in 1989. The medication has largely been replaced by newer and improved NSAAs, namely bicalutamide and enzalutamide, due to their better efficacy, tolerability, safety, and dosing frequency (once per day), and is now relatively little-used. It is on the World Health Organization\'s List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Prostate cancer === GnRH is released by the hypothalamus in a pulsatile fashion; this causes the anterior pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH stimulates the testes to produce testosterone, which is metabolized to DHT by the enzyme 5Î±-reductase. DHT, and to a significantly smaller extent, testosterone, stimulate prostate cancer cells to grow. Therefore, blocking these androgens can provide powerful treatment for prostate cancer, especially metastatic disease. Normally administered are GnRH analogues, such as leuprorelin or cetrorelix. Although GnRH agonists stimulate the same receptors that GnRH does, since they are present continuously and not in a pulsatile manner, they serve to inhibit the pituitary gland and therefore block the whole chain. However, they initially cause a surge in activity; this is not solely a theoretical risk but may cause the cancer to flare. Flutamide was initially used at the beginning of GnRH agonist therapy to block this surge, and it and other NSAAs continue in this use. In contrast to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists don\'t cause an initial androgen surge, and are gradually replacing GnRH agonists in clinical use. There have been studies to investigate the benefit of adding an antiandrogen to surgical orchiectomy or its continued use with a GnRH analogue (combined androgen blockade (CAB)). Adding antiandrogens to orchiectomy showed no benefit, while a small benefit was shown with adding antiandrogens to GnRH analogues. Unfortunately, therapies which lower testosterone levels, such as orchiectomy or GnRH analogue administration, also have significant side effects. Compared to these therapies, treatment with antiandrogens exhibits ""fewer hot flashes, less of an effect on libido, less muscle wasting, fewer personality changes, and less bone loss."" However, antiandrogen therapy alone is less effective than surgery. Nevertheless, given the advanced age of many with prostate cancer, as well as other features, many men may choose antiandrogen therapy alone for a better quality of life. Flutamide has been found to be similarly effective in the treatment of prostate cancer to bicalutamide, although indications of inferior efficacy, including greater compensatory increases in testosterone levels and greater reductions in PSA levels with bicalutamide, were observed. The medication, at a dosage of 750 mg/day (250 mg three times daily), has also been found to be equivalent in effectiveness to 250 mg/day oral cyproterone acetate as a monotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer in a large-scale clinical trial of 310 patients, though its side effect and toxicity profiles (including gynecomastia, diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, and liver disturbances) were regarded as considerably worse than those of cyproterone acetate. A dosage of 750 mg/day flutamide (250 mg/three times a day) is roughly equivalent in terms of effectiveness to 50 mg/day bicalutamide when used as the antiandrogen component in combined androgen blockade in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Flutamide has been used to prevent the effects of the testosterone flare at the start of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. The combination of flutamide with an estrogen such as ethinylestradiol sulfonate has been used as a form of combined androgen blockade and as an alternative to the combination of flutamide with surgical or medical castration. === Skin and hair conditions === Flutamide has been researched and used extensively in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions in women including acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and scalp hair loss, as well as in hyperandrogenism (e.g., in polycystic ovary syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia), and is effective in improving the symptoms of these conditions. The dosages used are lower than those used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Although flutamide continues to be used for these indications, its use in recent years has been limited due to the risk of potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, and it is no longer recommended as a first- or second-line therapy. The related NSAA bicalutamide has also been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism in women and appears to have comparable effectiveness to that of flutamide, but has a far lower and only small risk of hepatotoxicity in comparison. Aside from its risk of liver toxicity and besides other nonsteroidal antiandrogens, it has been said that flutamide is likely the best typically used antiandrogen medication for the treatment of androgen-dependent symptoms in women. This is related to its high effectiveness and minimal side effects. ==== Acne and seborrhea ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of acne and seborrhea in women in a number of studies. In a long-term study of 230 women with acne, 211 of whom also had seborrhea, very-low-dose flutamide alone or in combination with an oral contraceptive caused a marked decrease in acne and seborrhea after 6 months of treatment, with maximal effect by 1 year of treatment and benefits maintained in the years thereafter. In the study, 97% of the women reported satisfaction with the control of their acne with flutamide. In another study, flutamide decreased acne and seborrhea scores by 80% in only 3 months. In contrast, spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same time period, suggesting superior effectiveness for flutamide for these indications. Flutamide has, in general, been found to reduce symptoms of acne by as much as 90% even at low doses, with several studies showing complete acne clearance. ==== Excessive hair growth ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism (excessive body/facial hair growth) in numerous studies. It possesses moderate effectiveness for this indication, and the overall quality of the evidence is considered to be moderate. The medication shows equivalent or superior effectiveness to other antiandrogens including spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, and finasteride in the treatment of hirsutism, although its relatively high risk of hepatotoxicity makes it unfavorable compared to these other options. It has been used to treat hirsutism at dosages ranging from 62.5 mg/day to 750 mg/day. A study found that multiple dosages of flutamide significantly reduced hirsutism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and that there were no significant differences in the effectiveness for dosages of 125 mg/day, 250 mg/day, and 375 mg/day. In addition, a study found that combination of 125 mg/day flutamide with finasteride was no more effective than 125 mg/day flutamide alone in the treatment of hirsutism. These findings support the use of flutamide at lower doses for hirsutism without loss of effectiveness, which may help to lower the risk of hepatotoxicity. However, the risk has been found to remain even at very low doses. ==== Scalp hair loss ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of female pattern hair loss in a number of studies. In one study of 101 pre- and postmenopausal women, flutamide alone or in combination with an oral contraceptive produced a marked decrease in hair loss scores after 1 year of treatment, with maximum effect after 2 years of treatment and benefits maintained for another 2 years. In a small study of flutamide with an oral contraceptive, the medication caused an increase in cosmetically acceptance hair density in 6 of 7 women with diffuse scalp hair loss. In a comparative study, flutamide significantly improved scalp hair growth (21% reduction in Ludwig scores) in hyperandrogenic women after 1 year of treatment, whereas cyproterone acetate and finasteride were ineffective. === Other uses === Flutamide has been used in case reports to decrease the frequency of spontaneous orgasms, for instance in men with post-orgasmic illness syndrome. === Available forms === Flutamide is available in the form of 125 mg oral capsules and 250 mg oral tablets. == Side effects == The side effects of flutamide are sex-dependent. In men, a variety of side effects related to androgen deprivation may occur, the most common being gynecomastia and breast tenderness. Others include hot flashes, decreased muscle mass, decreased bone mass and an associated increased risk of fractures, depression, and sexual dysfunction including reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. In women, flutamide is, generally, relatively well tolerated, and does not interfere with ovulation. The only common side effect of flutamide in women is dry skin (75%), which can be attributed to a reduction of androgen-mediated sebum production. General side effects that may occur in either sex include dizziness, lack of appetite, gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, a greenish-bluish discoloration of the urine, and hepatic changes. Because flutamide is a pure antiandrogen, unlike steroidal antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate and megestrol acetate (which additionally possess progestogenic activity), it does not appear to have a risk of cardiovascular side effects (e.g., thromboembolism) or fluid retention. === Gynecomastia === Flutamide, as a monotherapy, causes gynecomastia in 30 to 79% of men, and also produces breast tenderness. However, more than 90% of cases of gynecomastia with NSAAs including flutamide are mild to moderate. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with predominantly antiestrogenic actions, can counteract flutamide-induced gynecomastia and breast pain in men. === Diarrhea === Diarrhea is more common and sometimes more severe with flutamide than with other NSAAs. In a comparative trial of combined androgen blockade for prostate cancer, the rate of diarrhea was 26% for flutamide and 12% for bicalutamide. Moreover, 6% of flutamide-treated patients discontinued the medication due to diarrhea, whereas only 0.5% of bicalutamide-treated patients did so. In the case of antiandrogen monotherapy for prostate cancer, the rates of diarrhea are 5 to 20% for flutamide, 2 to 5% for bicalutamide, and 2 to 4% for nilutamide. In contrast to diarrhea, the rates of nausea and vomiting are similar among the three medications. === Rare reactions === ==== Liver toxicity ==== Although rare, flutamide has been associated with severe hepatotoxicity and death. By 1996, 46 cases of severe cholestatic hepatitis had been reported, with 20 fatalities. There have been continued case reports since, including liver transplants and death. A 2021 review of the literature found 15 cases of serious hepatotoxicity in women treated with flutamide, including 7 liver transplantations and 2 deaths. Based on the number of prescriptions written and the number of cases reported in the MedWatch database, the rate of serious hepatotoxicity associated with flutamide treatment was estimated in 1996 as approximately 0.03% (3 per 10,000). However, other research has suggested that the true incidence of significant hepatotoxicity with flutamide may be much greater, as high as 0.18 to 10%. Flutamide is also associated with liver enzyme elevations in up to 42 to 62% of patients, although marked elevations in liver enzymes (above 5 times upper normal limit) occur only in 3 to 5%. The risk of hepatotoxicity with flutamide is much higher than with nilutamide or bicalutamide. Lower doses of the medication appear to have a possibly reduced but still significant risk. Liver function should be monitored regularly with liver function tests during flutamide treatment. In addition, due to the high risk of serious hepatotoxicity, flutamide should not be used in the absence of a serious indication. The mechanism of action of flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity is thought to be due to mitochondrial toxicity. Specifically, flutamide and particularly its major metabolite hydroxyflutamide inhibit enzymes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain in hepatocytes, including respiratory complexes I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase), II (succinate dehydrogenase), and V (ATP synthase), and thereby reduce cellular respiration via ATP depletion and hence decrease cell survival. Inhibition of taurocholate (a bile acid) efflux has also been implicated in flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity. In contrast to flutamide and hydroxyflutamide, which severely compromise hepatocyte cellular respiration in vitro, bicalutamide does not significantly do so at the same concentrations and is regarded as non-mitotoxic. It is thought that the nitroaromatic group of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide enhance their mitochondrial toxicity; bicalutamide, in contrast, possesses a cyano group in place of the nitro moiety, greatly reducing the potential for such toxicity. The hepatotoxicity of flutamide appears to depend on hydrolysis of flutamide catalyzed by an arylacetamide deacetalyse enzyme. This is analogous to the hepatotoxicity that occurs with the withdrawn paracetamol (acetominophen)-related medication phenacetin. In accordance, the combination of paracetamol (acetaminophen) and flutamide appears to result in additive to synergistic hepatotoxicity, indicating a potential drug interaction. Hepatotoxicity with flutamide may be cross-reactive with that of cyproterone acetate. ==== Others ==== Flutamide has also been associated with interstitial pneumonitis (which can progress to pulmonary fibrosis). The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis with flutamide was found to be 0.04% (4 per 10,000) in a large clinical cohort of 41,700 prostate cancer patients. A variety of case reports have associated flutamide with photosensitivity. Flutamide has been associated with several case reports of methemoglobinemia. Bicalutamide does not appear to share this risk with flutamide. Flutamide has also been associated with reports of sulfhemoglobinemia and neutropenia. === Birth defects === Out of the available endocrine-disrupting compounds looked at, flutamide has a notable effect on anogenital distance in rats.) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Flutamide acts as a selective, competitive, silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). Its active form, hydroxyflutamide, has between 10- and 25-fold higher affinity for the AR than does flutamide, and hence is a much more potent AR antagonist in comparison. However, at high concentrations, unlike flutamide, hydroxyflutamide is able to weakly activate the AR. Flutamide has far lower affinity for the AR than do steroidal antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, and it is a relatively weak antiandrogen in terms of potency by weight, but the large dosages at which flutamide is used appear to compensate for this. In accordance with its selectivity for the AR, flutamide does not interact with the progesterone, estrogen, glucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid receptor, and possesses no intrinsic progestogenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antigonadotropic activity. However, it can have some indirect estrogenic effects via increased levels of estradiol secondary to AR blockade, and this involved in the gynecomastia it can produce. Because flutamide does not have any estrogenic, progestogenic, or antigonadotropic activity, the medication does not cause menstrual irregularities in women. This is in contrast to steroidal antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate. Similarly to nilutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide, flutamide crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier and exerts central antiandrogen actions. Flutamide has been found to be equal to slightly more potent than cyproterone acetate and substantially more potent than spironolactone as an antiandrogen in bioassays. This is in spite of the fact that hydroxyflutamide has on the order of 10-fold lower affinity for the AR relative to cyproterone acetate. Hydroxyflutamide shows about 2- to 4-fold lower affinity for the rat and human AR than does bicalutamide. In addition, whereas bicalutamide has an elimination half-life of around 6 days, hydroxyflutamide has an elimination half-life of only 8 to 10 hours, a roughly 17-fold difference. In accordance, at dosages of 50 mg/day bicalutamide and 750 mg/day flutamide (a 15-fold difference), circulating levels of flutamide at steady-state have been found to be approximately 7.5-fold lower than those of bicalutamide. Moreover, whereas flutamide at this dosage has been found to produce a 75% reduction in prostate-specific antigen levels in men with prostate cancer, a fall of 90% has been demonstrated with this dosage of bicalutamide. In accordance, 50 mg/day bicalutamide has been found to possess equivalent or superior effectiveness to 750 mg/day flutamide in a large clinical trial for prostate cancer. Also, bicalutamide has been shown to be 5-fold more potent than flutamide in rats and 50-fold more potent than flutamide in dogs. Taken together, flutamide appears to be a considerably less potent and efficacious antiandrogen than is bicalutamide. Dose-ranging studies of flutamide in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer alone and in combination with a GnRH agonist have been performed. Flutamide increases testosterone levels by 5- to 10-fold in gonadally intact male rats. ==== CYP17A1 inhibition ==== Flutamide and hydroxyflutamide have been found in vitro to inhibit CYP17A1 (17Î±-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), an enzyme which is required for the biosynthesis of androgens. In accordance, flutamide has been found to slightly but significantly lower androgen levels in GnRH analogue-treated male prostate cancer patients and women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In a directly comparative study of flutamide monotherapy (375 mg once daily) versus bicalutamide monotherapy (80 mg once daily) in Japanese men with prostate cancer, after 24 weeks of treatment flutamide decreased dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels by about 44% while bicalutamide increased them by about 4%. As such, flutamide is a weak inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis. However, the clinical significance of this action may be limited when flutamide is given without a GnRH analogue to non-castrated men, as the medication markedly elevates testosterone levels into the high normal male range via prevention of AR activation-mediated negative feedback on the hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“gonadal axis in this context. ==== Other activities ==== Flutamide has been identified as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This may be involved in the hepatotoxicity of flutamide. === Pharmacokinetics === The absorption of flutamide is complete upon oral ingestion. Food has no effect on the bioavailability of flutamide. Steady-state levels of hydroxyflutamide, the active form of flutamide, are achieved after 2 to 4 days administration. Levels of hydroxyflutamide are approximately 50-fold higher than those of flutamide at steady-state. The plasma protein binding of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide are high; 94 to 96% and 92 to 94%, respectively. Flutamide and its metabolite hydroxyflutamide are known to be transported by the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1; ABCC1). Flutamide is metabolized by CYP1A2 (via Î±-hydroxylation) in the liver during first-pass metabolism to its main metabolite hydroxyflutamide (which accounts for 23% of an oral dose of flutamide one hour post-ingestion), and to at least five other, minor metabolites. Flutamide has at least 10 inactive metabolites total, including 4-nitro-3-fluoro-methylaniline. Flutamide is excreted in various forms in the urine, the primary form being 2-amino-5-nitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol. Flutamide and hydroxyflutamide have elimination half-lives of 4.7 hours and 6 hours in adults, respectively. However, the half-life of hydroxyflutamide is extended to 8 hours after a single dose and to 9.6 hours at steady state) in elderly individuals. The elimination half-lives of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide are regarded as too short to allow for once-daily dosing, and for this reason, flutamide is instead administered three times daily at 8-hour intervals. In contrast, the newer NSAAs nilutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide all have much longer half-lives, and this allows for once-daily administration in their cases. == Chemistry == Unlike the hormones with which it competes, flutamide is not a steroid; rather, it is a substituted anilide. Hence, it is described as nonsteroidal in order to distinguish it from older steroidal antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and megestrol acetate. === Synthesis === Schottenâ€“Baumann reaction between 4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline [393-11-3] (1) with isobutanoyl chloride [79-30-1] (2) in the presence of triethylamine. == History == Flutamide was first synthesized in 1967 by Neri and colleagues at Schering Plough Corporation. It was originally synthesized as a bacteriostatic agent, but was subsequently, and serendipitously found to possess antiandrogen activity. The code name of flutamide during development was SCH-13521. Clinical research of the medication began in 1971, and it was first marketed in 1983, specifically in Chile under the brand name Drogenil and in West Germany under the brand name Flugerel. Flutamide was not introduced in the United States until 1989; it was specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. The medication was first studied for the treatment of hirsutism in women in 1989. It was the first ""pure antiandrogen"" to be studied in the treatment of hirsutism. Flutamide was the first NSAA to be introduced, and was followed by nilutamide in 1989 and then bicalutamide in 1995. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Flutamide is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip DÃ©nomination Commune FranÃ§aise, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its names in Latin, German, and Spanish are flutamidum, flutamid, and flutamida, respectively. The medication has also been referred to by the name niftolide. === Brand names === Brand names of flutamide include or have included Cebatrol, Cytomid, Drogenil, Etaconil, Eulexin, Flucinom, Flumid, Flutacan, Flutamid, Flutamida, Flutamin, Flutan, Flutaplex, Flutasin, Fugerel, Profamid, and Sebatrol, among others. === Availability === Flutamide is marketed widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Central and South America, East and Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East. == Research == === Prostate cancer === The combination of an estrogen and flutamide as a form of combined androgen blockade for the treatment of prostate cancer has been researched. === Enlarged prostate === Flutamide has been studied in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; enlarged prostate) in men in several clinical studies. It has been found to reduce prostate volume by about 25%, which is comparable to the reduction achieved with the 5Î±-reductase inhibitor finasteride. Unfortunately, it has been associated with side effects in these studies including gynecomastia and breast tenderness (in about 50% of patients), gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, diarrhea, and flatulence, and hepatotoxicity, although sexual function including libido and erectile potency were maintained. === Breast cancer === Flutamide was studied for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in two phase II clinical trials but was found to be ineffective. Out of a total of 47 patients, only three short-term responses occurred. However, the patients in the studies were selected irrespective of AR, ERTooltip estrogen receptor, PRTooltip progesterone receptor, or HER2 status, which were all unknown. === Psychiatric disorders === Flutamide has been studied in the treatment of bulimia nervosa in women. Flutamide was found to be effective in the treatment of obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder (OCD) in men with comorbid Tourette\'s syndrome in one small randomized controlled trial. Conversely, it was ineffective in patients with OCD in another study. More research is necessary to determine whether flutamide is effective in the treatment of OCD. == References == == Further reading =='), 'MEDICAL')"	WIKIPEDIA	"Flutamide, sold under the brand name Eulexin among others, is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) which is used primarily to treat prostate cancer. It is also used in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions like acne, excessive hair growth, and high androgen levels in women. It is taken by mouth, usually three times per day. Side effects in men include breast tenderness and enlargement, feminization, sexual dysfunction, and hot flashes. Conversely, the medication has fewer side effects and is better-tolerated in women with the most common side effect being dry skin. Diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes can occur in both sexes. Rarely, flutamide can cause liver damage, lung disease, sensitivity to light, elevated methemoglobin, elevated sulfhemoglobin, and deficient neutrophils. Numerous cases of liver failure and death have been reported, which has limited the use of flutamide. Flutamide acts as a selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), competing with androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to ARs in tissues like the prostate gland. By doing so, it prevents their effects and stops them from stimulating prostate cancer cells to grow. Flutamide is a prodrug to a more active form. Flutamide and its active form stay in the body for a relatively short time, which makes it necessary to take flutamide multiple times per day. Flutamide was first described in 1967 and was first introduced for medical use in 1983. It became available in the United States in 1989. The medication has largely been replaced by newer and improved NSAAs, namely bicalutamide and enzalutamide, due to their better efficacy, tolerability, safety, and dosing frequency (once per day), and is now relatively little-used. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Prostate cancer === GnRH is released by the hypothalamus in a pulsatile fashion; this causes the anterior pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH stimulates the testes to produce testosterone, which is metabolized to DHT by the enzyme 5Î±-reductase. DHT, and to a significantly smaller extent, testosterone, stimulate prostate cancer cells to grow. Therefore, blocking these androgens can provide powerful treatment for prostate cancer, especially metastatic disease. Normally administered are GnRH analogues, such as leuprorelin or cetrorelix. Although GnRH agonists stimulate the same receptors that GnRH does, since they are present continuously and not in a pulsatile manner, they serve to inhibit the pituitary gland and therefore block the whole chain. However, they initially cause a surge in activity; this is not solely a theoretical risk but may cause the cancer to flare. Flutamide was initially used at the beginning of GnRH agonist therapy to block this surge, and it and other NSAAs continue in this use. In contrast to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists don't cause an initial androgen surge, and are gradually replacing GnRH agonists in clinical use. There have been studies to investigate the benefit of adding an antiandrogen to surgical orchiectomy or its continued use with a GnRH analogue (combined androgen blockade (CAB)). Adding antiandrogens to orchiectomy showed no benefit, while a small benefit was shown with adding antiandrogens to GnRH analogues. Unfortunately, therapies which lower testosterone levels, such as orchiectomy or GnRH analogue administration, also have significant side effects. Compared to these therapies, treatment with antiandrogens exhibits ""fewer hot flashes, less of an effect on libido, less muscle wasting, fewer personality changes, and less bone loss."" However, antiandrogen therapy alone is less effective than surgery. Nevertheless, given the advanced age of many with prostate cancer, as well as other features, many men may choose antiandrogen therapy alone for a better quality of life. Flutamide has been found to be similarly effective in the treatment of prostate cancer to bicalutamide, although indications of inferior efficacy, including greater compensatory increases in testosterone levels and greater reductions in PSA levels with bicalutamide, were observed. The medication, at a dosage of 750 mg/day (250 mg three times daily), has also been found to be equivalent in effectiveness to 250 mg/day oral cyproterone acetate as a monotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer in a large-scale clinical trial of 310 patients, though its side effect and toxicity profiles (including gynecomastia, diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, and liver disturbances) were regarded as considerably worse than those of cyproterone acetate. A dosage of 750 mg/day flutamide (250 mg/three times a day) is roughly equivalent in terms of effectiveness to 50 mg/day bicalutamide when used as the antiandrogen component in combined androgen blockade in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Flutamide has been used to prevent the effects of the testosterone flare at the start of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. The combination of flutamide with an estrogen such as ethinylestradiol sulfonate has been used as a form of combined androgen blockade and as an alternative to the combination of flutamide with surgical or medical castration. === Skin and hair conditions === Flutamide has been researched and used extensively in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions in women including acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and scalp hair loss, as well as in hyperandrogenism (e.g., in polycystic ovary syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia), and is effective in improving the symptoms of these conditions.

Although flutamide continues to be used for these indications, its use in recent years has been limited due to the risk of potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, and it is no longer recommended as a first- or second-line therapy. The related NSAA bicalutamide has also been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism in women and appears to have comparable effectiveness to that of flutamide, but has a far lower and only small risk of hepatotoxicity in comparison. Aside from its risk of liver toxicity and besides other nonsteroidal antiandrogens, it has been said that flutamide is likely the best typically used antiandrogen medication for the treatment of androgen-dependent symptoms in women.

In a long-term study of 230 women with acne, 211 of whom also had seborrhea, very-low-dose flutamide alone or in combination with an oral contraceptive caused a marked decrease in acne and seborrhea after 6 months of treatment, with maximal effect by 1 year of treatment and benefits maintained in the years thereafter. In the study, 97% of the women reported satisfaction with the control of their acne with flutamide. In another study, flutamide decreased acne and seborrhea scores by 80% in only 3 months. In contrast, spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same time period, suggesting superior effectiveness for flutamide for these indications. Flutamide has, in general, been found to reduce symptoms of acne by as much as 90% even at low doses, with several studies showing complete acne clearance. ==== Excessive hair growth ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism (excessive body/facial hair growth) in numerous studies.

These findings support the use of flutamide at lower doses for hirsutism without loss of effectiveness, which may help to lower the risk of hepatotoxicity. However, the risk has been found to remain even at very low doses. ==== Scalp hair loss ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of female pattern hair loss in a number of studies.

In a comparative study, flutamide significantly improved scalp hair growth (21% reduction in Ludwig scores) in hyperandrogenic women after 1 year of treatment, whereas cyproterone acetate and finasteride were ineffective. === Other uses === Flutamide has been used in case reports to decrease the frequency of spontaneous orgasms, for instance in men with post-orgasmic illness syndrome. === Available forms === Flutamide is available in the form of 125 mg oral capsules and 250 mg oral tablets. == Side effects == The side effects of flutamide are sex-dependent. In men, a variety of side effects related to androgen deprivation may occur, the most common being gynecomastia and breast tenderness. Others include hot flashes, decreased muscle mass, decreased bone mass and an associated increased risk of fractures, depression, and sexual dysfunction including reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. In women, flutamide is, generally, relatively well tolerated, and does not interfere with ovulation.

In a comparative trial of combined androgen blockade for prostate cancer, the rate of diarrhea was 26% for flutamide and 12% for bicalutamide. Moreover, 6% of flutamide-treated patients discontinued the medication due to diarrhea, whereas only 0.5% of bicalutamide-treated patients did so. In the case of antiandrogen monotherapy for prostate cancer, the rates of diarrhea are 5 to 20% for flutamide, 2 to 5% for bicalutamide, and 2 to 4% for nilutamide. In contrast to diarrhea, the rates of nausea and vomiting are similar among the three medications. === Rare reactions === ==== Liver toxicity ==== Although rare, flutamide has been associated with severe hepatotoxicity and death. By 1996, 46 cases of severe cholestatic hepatitis had been reported, with 20 fatalities. There have been continued case reports since, including liver transplants and death. A 2021 review of the literature found 15 cases of serious hepatotoxicity in women treated with flutamide, including 7 liver transplantations and 2 deaths. Based on the number of prescriptions written and the number of cases reported in the MedWatch database, the rate of serious hepatotoxicity associated with flutamide treatment was estimated in 1996 as approximately 0.03% (3 per 10,000). However, other research has suggested that the true incidence of significant hepatotoxicity with flutamide may be much greater, as high as 0.18 to 10%. Flutamide is also associated with liver enzyme elevations in up to 42 to 62% of patients, although marked elevations in liver enzymes (above 5 times upper normal limit) occur only in 3 to 5%. The risk of hepatotoxicity with flutamide is much higher than with nilutamide or bicalutamide. Lower doses of the medication appear to have a possibly reduced but still significant risk. Liver function should be monitored regularly with liver function tests during flutamide treatment. In addition, due to the high risk of serious hepatotoxicity, flutamide should not be used in the absence of a serious indication. The mechanism of action of flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity is thought to be due to mitochondrial toxicity. Specifically, flutamide and particularly its major metabolite hydroxyflutamide inhibit enzymes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain in hepatocytes, including respiratory complexes I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase), II (succinate dehydrogenase), and V (ATP synthase), and thereby reduce cellular respiration via ATP depletion and hence decrease cell survival. Inhibition of taurocholate (a bile acid) efflux has also been implicated in flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity. In contrast to flutamide and hydroxyflutamide, which severely compromise hepatocyte cellular respiration in vitro, bicalutamide does not significantly do so at the same concentrations and is regarded as non-mitotoxic. It is thought that the nitroaromatic group of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide enhance their mitochondrial toxicity; bicalutamide, in contrast, possesses a cyano group in place of the nitro moiety, greatly reducing the potential for such toxicity. The hepatotoxicity of flutamide appears to depend on hydrolysis of flutamide catalyzed by an arylacetamide deacetalyse enzyme. This is analogous to the hepatotoxicity that occurs with the withdrawn paracetamol (acetominophen)-related medication phenacetin. In accordance, the combination of paracetamol (acetaminophen) and flutamide appears to result in additive to synergistic hepatotoxicity, indicating a potential drug interaction. Hepatotoxicity with flutamide may be cross-reactive with that of cyproterone acetate. ==== Others ==== Flutamide has also been associated with interstitial pneumonitis (which can progress to pulmonary fibrosis). The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis with flutamide was found to be 0.04% (4 per 10,000) in a large clinical cohort of 41,700 prostate cancer patients. A variety of case reports have associated flutamide with photosensitivity. Flutamide has been associated with several case reports of methemoglobinemia. Bicalutamide does not appear to share this risk with flutamide. Flutamide has also been associated with reports of sulfhemoglobinemia and neutropenia. === Birth defects === Out of the available endocrine-disrupting compounds looked at, flutamide has a notable effect on anogenital distance in rats.) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Flutamide acts as a selective, competitive, silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). Its active form, hydroxyflutamide, has between 10- and 25-fold higher affinity for the AR than does flutamide, and hence is a much more potent AR antagonist in comparison. However, at high concentrations, unlike flutamide, hydroxyflutamide is able to weakly activate the AR. Flutamide has far lower affinity for the AR than do steroidal antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, and it is a relatively weak antiandrogen in terms of potency by weight, but the large dosages at which flutamide is used appear to compensate for this. In accordance with its selectivity for the AR, flutamide does not interact with the progesterone, estrogen, glucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid receptor, and possesses no intrinsic progestogenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antigonadotropic activity. However, it can have some indirect estrogenic effects via increased levels of estradiol secondary to AR blockade, and this involved in the gynecomastia it can produce. Because flutamide does not have any estrogenic, progestogenic, or antigonadotropic activity, the medication does not cause menstrual irregularities in women. This is in contrast to steroidal antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate. Similarly to nilutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide, flutamide crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier and exerts central antiandrogen actions. Flutamide has been found to be equal to slightly more potent than cyproterone acetate and substantially more potent than spironolactone as an antiandrogen in bioassays. This is in spite of the fact that hydroxyflutamide has on the order of 10-fold lower affinity for the AR relative to cyproterone acetate. Hydroxyflutamide shows about 2- to 4-fold lower affinity for the rat and human AR than does bicalutamide. In addition, whereas bicalutamide has an elimination half-life of around 6 days, hydroxyflutamide has an elimination half-life of only 8 to 10 hours, a roughly 17-fold difference. In accordance, at dosages of 50 mg/day bicalutamide and 750 mg/day flutamide (a 15-fold difference), circulating levels of flutamide at steady-state have been found to be approximately 7.5-fold lower than those of bicalutamide. Moreover, whereas flutamide at this dosage has been found to produce a 75% reduction in prostate-specific antigen levels in men with prostate cancer, a fall of 90% has been demonstrated with this dosage of bicalutamide. In accordance, 50 mg/day bicalutamide has been found to possess equivalent or superior effectiveness to 750 mg/day flutamide in a large clinical trial for prostate cancer. Also, bicalutamide has been shown to be 5-fold more potent than flutamide in rats and 50-fold more potent than flutamide in dogs. Taken together, flutamide appears to be a considerably less potent and efficacious antiandrogen than is bicalutamide. Dose-ranging studies of flutamide in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer alone and in combination with a GnRH agonist have been performed. Flutamide increases testosterone levels by 5- to 10-fold in gonadally intact male rats. ==== CYP17A1 inhibition ==== Flutamide and hydroxyflutamide have been found in vitro to inhibit CYP17A1 (17Î±-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), an enzyme which is required for the biosynthesis of androgens. In accordance, flutamide has been found to slightly but significantly lower androgen levels in GnRH analogue-treated male prostate cancer patients and women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In a directly comparative study of flutamide monotherapy (375 mg once daily) versus bicalutamide monotherapy (80 mg once daily) in Japanese men with prostate cancer, after 24 weeks of treatment flutamide decreased dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels by about 44% while bicalutamide increased them by about 4%. As such, flutamide is a weak inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis. However, the clinical significance of this action may be limited when flutamide is given without a GnRH analogue to non-castrated men, as the medication markedly elevates testosterone levels into the high normal male range via prevention of AR activation-mediated negative feedback on the hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“gonadal axis in this context. ==== Other activities ==== Flutamide has been identified as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This may be involved in the hepatotoxicity of flutamide. === Pharmacokinetics === The absorption of flutamide is complete upon oral ingestion. Food has no effect on the bioavailability of flutamide. Steady-state levels of hydroxyflutamide, the active form of flutamide, are achieved after 2 to 4 days administration. Levels of hydroxyflutamide are approximately 50-fold higher than those of flutamide at steady-state. The plasma protein binding of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide are high; 94 to 96% and 92 to 94%, respectively. Flutamide and its metabolite hydroxyflutamide are known to be transported by the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1; ABCC1). Flutamide is metabolized by CYP1A2 (via Î±-hydroxylation) in the liver during first-pass metabolism to its main metabolite hydroxyflutamide (which accounts for 23% of an oral dose of flutamide one hour post-ingestion), and to at least five other, minor metabolites. Flutamide has at least 10 inactive metabolites total, including 4-nitro-3-fluoro-methylaniline. Flutamide is excreted in various forms in the urine, the primary form being 2-amino-5-nitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol. Flutamide and hydroxyflutamide have elimination half-lives of 4.7 hours and 6 hours in adults, respectively. However, the half-life of hydroxyflutamide is extended to 8 hours after a single dose and to 9.6 hours at steady state) in elderly individuals. The elimination half-lives of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide are regarded as too short to allow for once-daily dosing, and for this reason, flutamide is instead administered three times daily at 8-hour intervals. In contrast, the newer NSAAs nilutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide all have much longer half-lives, and this allows for once-daily administration in their cases. == Chemistry == Unlike the hormones with which it competes, flutamide is not a steroid; rather, it is a substituted anilide. Hence, it is described as nonsteroidal in order to distinguish it from older steroidal antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and megestrol acetate. === Synthesis === Schottenâ€“Baumann reaction between 4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline [393-11-3] (1) with isobutanoyl chloride [79-30-1] (2) in the presence of triethylamine. == History == Flutamide was first synthesized in 1967 by Neri and colleagues at Schering Plough Corporation. It was originally synthesized as a bacteriostatic agent, but was subsequently, and serendipitously found to possess antiandrogen activity. The code name of flutamide during development was SCH-13521. Clinical research of the medication began in 1971, and it was first marketed in 1983, specifically in Chile under the brand name Drogenil and in West Germany under the brand name Flugerel. Flutamide was not introduced in the United States until 1989; it was specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. The medication was first studied for the treatment of hirsutism in women in 1989. It was the first ""pure antiandrogen"" to be studied in the treatment of hirsutism. Flutamide was the first NSAA to be introduced, and was followed by nilutamide in 1989 and then bicalutamide in 1995. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Flutamide is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip DÃ©nomination Commune FranÃ§aise, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its names in Latin, German, and Spanish are flutamidum, flutamid, and flutamida, respectively. The medication has also been referred to by the name niftolide. === Brand names === Brand names of flutamide include or have included Cebatrol, Cytomid, Drogenil, Etaconil, Eulexin, Flucinom, Flumid, Flutacan, Flutamid, Flutamida, Flutamin, Flutan, Flutaplex, Flutasin, Fugerel, Profamid, and Sebatrol, among others. === Availability === Flutamide is marketed widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Central and South America, East and Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East. == Research == === Prostate cancer === The combination of an estrogen and flutamide as a form of combined androgen blockade for the treatment of prostate cancer has been researched. === Enlarged prostate === Flutamide has been studied in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; enlarged prostate) in men in several clinical studies. It has been found to reduce prostate volume by about 25%, which is comparable to the reduction achieved with the 5Î±-reductase inhibitor finasteride. Unfortunately, it has been associated with side effects in these studies including gynecomastia and breast tenderness (in about 50% of patients), gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, diarrhea, and flatulence, and hepatotoxicity, although sexual function including libido and erectile potency were maintained. === Breast cancer === Flutamide was studied for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in two phase II clinical trials but was found to be ineffective. Out of a total of 47 patients, only three short-term responses occurred. However, the patients in the studies were selected irrespective of AR, ERTooltip estrogen receptor, PRTooltip progesterone receptor, or HER2 status, which were all unknown. === Psychiatric disorders === Flutamide has been studied in the treatment of bulimia nervosa in women. Flutamide was found to be effective in the treatment of obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder (OCD) in men with comorbid Tourette's syndrome in one small randomized controlled trial. Conversely, it was ineffective in patients with OCD in another study. More research is necessary to determine whether flutamide is effective in the treatment of OCD. == References == == Further reading =="	26229	MEDICAL	True

It is a highly oxidized tetranortriterpenoid which boasts a plethora of oxygen-bearing functional groups, including an enol ether, acetal, hemiacetal, tetra-substituted epoxide and a variety of carboxylic esters. == Chemical synthesis == Azadirachtin has a complex molecular structure; it presents both secondary and tertiary hydroxyl groups and a tetrahydrofuran ether in its molecular structure, alongside 16 stereogenic centres, 7 of which are tetrasubstituted. These characteristics explain the great difficulty encountered when trying to prepare this compound from simple precursors, using methods of synthetic organic chemistry. Hence, the first total synthesis was published over 22 years after the compound's discovery: this first synthesis was completed by the research group of Steven Ley at the University of Cambridge in 2007. The described synthesis was a relay approach, with the required, heavily functionalized decalin intermediate being made by total synthesis on a small scale, but being derived from the natural product itself for the gram-scale operations required to complete the synthesis. == Occurrence and use == Initially found to be active as a feeding inhibitor towards the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria), it is now known to affect over 200 species of insects, by acting mainly as an antifeedant and growth disruptor. Azadirachtin exhibits considerable toxicity towards African cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis), which are resistant to a commonly used biological pesticide, Bacillus thuringiensis. Azadirachtin fulfills many of the criteria needed for a good insecticide. Azadirachtin is biodegradable (it degrades within 100 hours when exposed to light and water) and shows very low toxicity to mammals (the LD50 in rats is > 3,540 mg/kg making it practically non-toxic). This compound is found in the seeds (0.2 to 0.8 percent by weight) of the neem tree, Azadirachta indica (hence the prefix aza does not imply an aza compound, but refers to the scientific species name). Many more compounds, related to azadirachtin, are present in the seeds as well as in the leaves and the bark of the neem tree which also show strong biological activities among various pest insects Effects of these preparations on beneficial arthropods are generally considered to be minimal . Some laboratory and field studies have found neem extracts to be compatible with biological control. Because pure neem oil contains other insecticidal and fungicidal compounds in addition to azadirachtin, it is generally mixed at a rate of 1 US fluid ounce per US gallon (7.8 mL/L) of water when used as a pesticide. Azadirachtin is the active ingredient in many pesticides including TreeAzin, AzaMax, BioNEEM, AzaGuard, and AzaSol, Terramera Proof and Terramera Cirkil. Azadirachtin has a synergistic effect with the biocontrol agent Beauveria. Nimbecidine is a natural product insecticide mix which is mostly azadirachtin, with some other limonoids. == Mechanism of action == Azadirachtin interferes with a wide variety of insect pathways. The substance acts as an insect growth regulator. It antagonizes both ecdysteroid (mainly 20E) and juvenile hormone activities by reducing secretion of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and allatotropins from the corpus cardiacum complex.

PDF Copy Extoxnet Neem: The wonder tree""), 'MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL')"	WIKIPEDIA	Azadirachtin, a chemical compound belonging to the limonoid group, is a secondary metabolite present in neem seeds. It is a highly oxidized tetranortriterpenoid which boasts a plethora of oxygen-bearing functional groups, including an enol ether, acetal, hemiacetal, tetra-substituted epoxide and a variety of carboxylic esters. == Chemical synthesis == Azadirachtin has a complex molecular structure; it presents both secondary and tertiary hydroxyl groups and a tetrahydrofuran ether in its molecular structure, alongside 16 stereogenic centres, 7 of which are tetrasubstituted. These characteristics explain the great difficulty encountered when trying to prepare this compound from simple precursors, using methods of synthetic organic chemistry. Hence, the first total synthesis was published over 22 years after the compound's discovery: this first synthesis was completed by the research group of Steven Ley at the University of Cambridge in 2007. The described synthesis was a relay approach, with the required, heavily functionalized decalin intermediate being made by total synthesis on a small scale, but being derived from the natural product itself for the gram-scale operations required to complete the synthesis. == Occurrence and use == Initially found to be active as a feeding inhibitor towards the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria), it is now known to affect over 200 species of insects, by acting mainly as an antifeedant and growth disruptor. Azadirachtin exhibits considerable toxicity towards African cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis), which are resistant to a commonly used biological pesticide, Bacillus thuringiensis. Azadirachtin fulfills many of the criteria needed for a good insecticide. Azadirachtin is biodegradable (it degrades within 100 hours when exposed to light and water) and shows very low toxicity to mammals (the LD50 in rats is > 3,540 mg/kg making it practically non-toxic). This compound is found in the seeds (0.2 to 0.8 percent by weight) of the neem tree, Azadirachta indica (hence the prefix aza does not imply an aza compound, but refers to the scientific species name). Many more compounds, related to azadirachtin, are present in the seeds as well as in the leaves and the bark of the neem tree which also show strong biological activities among various pest insects Effects of these preparations on beneficial arthropods are generally considered to be minimal . Some laboratory and field studies have found neem extracts to be compatible with biological control. Because pure neem oil contains other insecticidal and fungicidal compounds in addition to azadirachtin, it is generally mixed at a rate of 1 US fluid ounce per US gallon (7.8 mL/L) of water when used as a pesticide. Azadirachtin is the active ingredient in many pesticides including TreeAzin, AzaMax, BioNEEM, AzaGuard, and AzaSol, Terramera Proof and Terramera Cirkil. Azadirachtin has a synergistic effect with the biocontrol agent Beauveria. Nimbecidine is a natural product insecticide mix which is mostly azadirachtin, with some other limonoids. == Mechanism of action == Azadirachtin interferes with a wide variety of insect pathways. The substance acts as an insect growth regulator. It antagonizes both ecdysteroid (mainly 20E) and juvenile hormone activities by reducing secretion of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and allatotropins from the corpus cardiacum complex.

It belongs to the subgroup of polyphenols called flavonoids. The name of the catechin chemical family derives from catechu, which is the tannic juice or boiled extract of Mimosa catechu (Acacia catechu L.f). == Chemistry == Catechin possesses two benzene rings (called the A and B rings) and a dihydropyran heterocycle (the C ring) with a hydroxyl group on carbon 3. The A ring is similar to a resorcinol moiety while the B ring is similar to a catechol moiety. There are two chiral centers on the molecule on carbons 2 and 3. Therefore, it has four diastereoisomers. Two of the isomers are in trans configuration and are called catechin and the other two are in cis configuration and are called epicatechin. The most common catechin isomer is (+)-catechin. The other stereoisomer is (âˆ’)-catechin or ent-catechin. The most common epicatechin isomer is (âˆ’)-epicatechin (also known under the names L-epicatechin, epicatechol, (âˆ’)-epicatechol, L-acacatechin, L-epicatechol, epicatechin, 2,3-cis-epicatechin or (2R,3R)-(âˆ’)-epicatechin). The different epimers can be separated using chiral column chromatography. Making reference to no particular isomer, the molecule can just be called catechin. Mixtures of the different enantiomers can be called (Â±)-catechin or DL-catechin and (Â±)-epicatechin or DL-epicatechin. Catechin and epicatechin are the building blocks of the proanthocyanidins, a type of condensed tannin. Diastereoisomers gallery Moreover, the flexibility of the C-ring allows for two conformation isomers, putting the B-ring either in a pseudoequatorial position (E conformer) or in a pseudoaxial position (A conformer). Studies confirmed that (+)-catechin adopts a mixture of A- and E-conformers in aqueous solution and their conformational equilibrium has been evaluated to be 33:67. As flavonoids, catechins can act as antioxidants when in high concentration in vitro, but compared with other flavonoids, their antioxidant potential is low. The ability to quench singlet oxygen seems to be in relation with the chemical structure of catechin, with the presence of the catechol moiety on ring B and the presence of a hydroxyl group activating the double bond on ring C. === Oxidation === Electrochemical experiments show that (+)-catechin oxidation mechanism proceeds in sequential steps, related with the catechol and resorcinol groups and the oxidation is pH-dependent. The oxidation of the catechol 3â€²,4â€²-dihydroxyl electron-donating groups occurs first, at very low positive potentials, and is a reversible reaction. The hydroxyl groups of the resorcinol moiety oxidised afterwards were shown to undergo an irreversible oxidation reaction. The laccase/ABTS system oxidizes (+)-catechin to oligomeric products of which proanthocyanidin A2 is a dimer. === Spectral data === == Natural occurrences == (+)-Catechin and (âˆ’)-epicatechin as well as their gallic acid conjugates are ubiquitous constituents of vascular plants, and frequent components of traditional herbal remedies, such as Uncaria rhynchophylla. The two isomers are mostly found as cacao and tea constituents, as well as in Vitis vinifera grapes. === In food === The main dietary sources of catechins in Europe and the United States are tea and pome fruits. Catechins and epicatechins are found in cocoa, which, according to one database, has the highest content (108 mg/100 g) of catechins among foods analyzed, followed by prune juice (25 mg/100 ml) and broad bean pod (16 mg/100 g). AÃ§aÃ­ oil, obtained from the fruit of the aÃ§aÃ­ palm (Euterpe oleracea), contains (+)-catechins (67 mg/kg). Catechins are diverse among foods, from peaches to green tea and vinegar. Catechins are found in barley grain, where they are the main phenolic compound responsible for dough discoloration. The taste associated with monomeric (+)-catechin or (âˆ’)-epicatechin is described as slightly astringent, but not bitter. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of catechin begins with ma 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA starter unit which undergoes chain extension by the addition of three malonyl-CoAs through a PKSIII pathway. 4-Hydroxycinnamoyl CoA is biosynthesized from L-phenylalanine through the Shikimate pathway. L-Phenylalanine is first deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) forming cinnamic acid which is then oxidized to 4-hydroxycinnamic acid by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase. Chalcone synthase then catalyzes the condensation of 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA to form chalcone. Chalcone is then isomerized to naringenin by chalcone isomerase which is oxidized to eriodictyol by flavonoid 3â€²-hydroxylase and further oxidized to taxifolin by flavanone 3-hydroxylase. Taxifolin is then reduced by dihydroflavanol 4-reductase and leucoanthocyanidin reductase to yield catechin. The biosynthesis of catechin is shown below Leucocyanidin reductase (LCR) uses 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin to produce (+)-catechin and is the first enzyme in the proanthocyanidin (PA) specific pathway. Its activity has been measured in leaves, flowers, and seeds of the legumes Medicago sativa, Lotus japonicus, Lotus uliginosus, Hedysarum sulfurescens, and Robinia pseudoacacia. The enzyme is also present in Vitis vinifera (grape). === Biodegradation === Catechin oxygenase, a key enzyme in the degradation of catechin, is present in fungi and bacteria. Among bacteria, degradation of (+)-catechin can be achieved by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Catechin is metabolized to protocatechuic acid (PCA) and phloroglucinol carboxylic acid (PGCA). It is also degraded by Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Phloroglucinol carboxylic acid is further decarboxylated to phloroglucinol, which is dehydroxylated to resorcinol. Resorcinol is hydroxylated to hydroxyquinol. Protocatechuic acid and hydroxyquinol undergo intradiol cleavage through protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase and hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase to form Î²-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid and maleyl acetate. Among fungi, degradation of catechin can be achieved by Chaetomium cupreum. === Metabolism in humans === Catechins are metabolised upon uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, in particular the jejunum, and in the liver, resulting in so-called structurally related epicatechin metabolites (SREM). The main metabolic pathways for SREMs are glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation of the catechol group by catechol-O-methyl transferase, with only small amounts detected in plasma. The majority of dietary catechins are however metabolised by the colonic microbiome to gamma-valerolactones and hippuric acids which undergo further biotransformation, glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation in the liver. The stereochemical configuration of catechins has a strong impact on their uptake and metabolism as uptake is highest for (âˆ’)-epicatechin and lowest for (âˆ’)-catechin. === Biotransformation === Biotransformation of (+)-catechin into taxifolin by a two-step oxidation can be achieved by Burkholderia sp. (+)-Catechin and (âˆ’)-epicatechin are transformed by the endophytic filamentous fungus Diaporthe sp. into the 3,4-cis-dihydroxyflavan derivatives, (+)-(2R,3S,4S)-3,4,5,7,3â€²,4â€²-hexahydroxyflavan (leucocyanidin) and (âˆ’)-(2R,3R,4R)-3,4,5,7,3â€²,4â€²-hexahydroxyflavan, respectively, whereas (âˆ’)-catechin and (+)-epicatechin with a (2S)-phenyl group resisted the biooxidation. Leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) uses (2R,3S)-catechin, NADP+ and H2O to produce 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin, NADPH, and H+. Its gene expression has been studied in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves. === Glycosides === (2R,3S)-Catechin-7-O-Î²-D-glucopyranoside can be isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and malt. Epigeoside (catechin-3-O-Î±-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1â€“4)-Î²-D-glucopyranosyl-(1â€“6)-Î²-D-glucopyranoside) can be isolated from the rhizomes of Epigynum auritum. == Research == === Vascular function === Only limited evidence from dietary studies indicates that catechins may affect endothelium-dependent vasodilation which could contribute to normal blood flow regulation in humans. Green tea catechins may improve blood pressure, especially when systolic blood pressure is above 130 mmHg. Due to extensive metabolism during digestion, the fate and activity of catechin metabolites responsible for this effect on blood vessels, as well as the actual mode of action, are unknown. === Adverse events === Catechin and its metabolites can bind tightly to red blood cells and thereby induce the development of autoantibodies, resulting in haemolytic anaemia and renal failure. This resulted in the withdrawal of the catechin-containing drug Catergen, used to treat viral hepatitis, from market in 1985. Catechins from green tea can be hepatotoxic and the European Food Safety Authority has recommended not to exceed 800 mg per day. === Other === One limited meta-analysis showed that increasing consumption of green tea and its catechins to seven cups per day provided a small reduction in prostate cancer. Nanoparticle methods are under preliminary research as potential delivery systems of catechins. == Botanical effects == Catechins released into the ground by some plants may hinder the growth of their neighbors, a form of allelopathy. Centaurea maculosa, the spotted knapweed often studied for this behavior, releases catechin isomers into the ground through its roots, potentially having effects as an antibiotic or herbicide. One hypothesis is that it causes a reactive oxygen species wave through the target plant's root to kill root cells by apoptosis. Most plants in the European ecosystem have defenses against catechin, but few plants are protected against it in the North American ecosystem where Centaurea maculosa is an invasive, uncontrolled weed. Catechin acts as an infection-inhibiting factor in strawberry leaves.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of n-3 fatty acid supplements on urine metabolite profiling and their correlation with metabolic risk factors in Chinese T2D patients. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in 59 Chinese patients with T2D, who were randomized to receive fish oil (FO), flaxseed oil (FSO) or corn oil (CO, serving as a control group) capsules for 180 days. Morning urine samples were collected before and after the intervention and were analyzed for metabolomics by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS in positive and negative ionization modes. In the FO group, levels of 2-hexenoylcarnitine (C6:1) (p < 0.001) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF) (p = 0.004) were significantly increased while hydroxyisovaleroyl carnitine (C5:OH) (p < 0.001) was significantly decreased compared with the CO group.

A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in 59 Chinese patients with T2D, who were randomized to receive fish oil (FO), flaxseed oil (FSO) or corn oil (CO, serving as a control group) capsules for 180 days. Morning urine samples were collected before and after the intervention and were analyzed for metabolomics by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS in positive and negative ionization modes. In the FO group, levels of 2-hexenoylcarnitine (C6:1) (p < 0.001) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF) (p = 0.004) were significantly increased while hydroxyisovaleroyl carnitine (C5:OH) (p < 0.001) was significantly decreased compared with the CO group. In addition, geranylacetone (p = 0.023) and citronellyl propionate (p = 0.038) levels were significantly elevated, while dihydrojasmonic acid (p = 0.003) was significantly reduced in the FSO group compared with that in the CO group. Moreover, increased C6:1 was correlated with decreased serum triglycerides (r = -0.340, p = 0.020). The change of urine CMPF showed inverse correlation with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (r = -0.338, p = 0.020), while C5:OH was positively correlated with apolipoprotein B (APOB) and BUN (r = 0.386, p = 0.015; r = 0.327, p = 0.025). Besides, the change of urine CMPF was positively correlated with serum CMPF (r = 0.646, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the present study confirmed that CMPF is a strong biomarker of fish oil, and indicated that marine n-3 PUFA intake might have a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism and renal function in patients with T2D. A new method is described for the determination of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) in Lemna minor plant extracts using liquid chromatography (LC) with fluorescence detection. Plant tissues were extracted and derivatised using 9-anthryldiazomethane (ADAM reagent) prepared in situ. Accuracy and precision were improved by using the internal standard dihydrojasmonic acid (dh-JA) for the correction of JA losses during sample preparation steps. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of ADAM derivatives of JA and dh-JA confirmed that a single molecule of JA and dh-JA was coupled with one molecule of reagent. Derivatives of JA and dh-JA were separated with gradient elution on a C18 reversed-phase column using acetonitrile/water as a mobile phase and detected by a fluorescence detector at excitation and emission wavelengths of 254 and 412 nm, respectively. The detection limits of JA and dh-JA were 2.9 ng mL(-1) and 3.7 ng mL(-1) per 50-microL injection. The method is reproducible and selective and yields single peaks for each compound regardless of isomer. The specificity and accuracy of the proposed LC/FD method was confirmed by liquid chromatography-TurboIon Spray tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) analysis of free JA in Lemna minor samples under multiple reaction monitoring conditions.	4109	FOOD	False

Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, which confers high-grade malignancy. 12S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) generated by platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) is considered a key modulator of cancer metastasis through unknown mechanisms. In platelets, 12-HETE can be esterified into plasma membrane phospholipids (PLs), which drive thrombosis. Using cocultures of human platelets and human colon adenocarcinoma cells (line HT29) and LC-MS/MS, we investigated the impact of platelets on cancer cell biosynthesis of 12S-HETE and its esterification into PLs and whether platelet ability to transfer its molecular cargo might play a role. To this aim, we performed coculture experiments with CFSE[5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester]-loaded platelets. HT29 cells did not generate 12S-HETE or express 12-LOX. However, they acquired the capacity to produce 12S-HETE mainly esterified in plasmalogen phospholipid forms following the uptake of platelet-derived medium-sized EVs (mEVs) expressing 12-LOX. 12-LOX was detected in plasma mEV of patients with adenomas/adenocarcinomas, implying their potential to deliver the protein to cancer cells in\xa0vivo. In cancer cells exposed to platelets, endogenous but not exogenous 12S-HETE contributed to changes in EMT gene expression, mitigated by three structurally unrelated 12-LOX inhibitors. In conclusion, we showed that platelets induce the generation of primarily esterified 12-HETE in colon cancer cells following mEV-mediated delivery of 12-LOX. The modification of cancer cell phospholipids by 12-HETE may functionally impact cancer cell biology and represent a novel target for anticancer agent development. Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) often exhibit hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia. Studies have shown that intestinal microorganisms are closely related to the occurrence of NAFLD and atherosclerosis. Our previous study has underscored the protective role of microRNA-30a-5p (miR-30a-5p) against atherosclerosis. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the effect and underlying mechanism of the intestinal microorganisms of miR-30a-5p knockout (KO) mice on NAFLD. Our findings demonstrated that KO exacerbated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis and disrupted liver function, as evidenced by elevated levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, and total bile acids in serum. Fecal microbiota from HFD-fed KO mice induced hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, and higher levels of enzymes indicative of liver damage in wild-type mice. Remarkably, KO mice significantly intensified the above effects. 16s rDNA sequencing and metabolomics of the intestinal microbiota in the HFD-treated KO and WT mice showed that the loss of miR-30a-5p resulted in intestinal microbiota imbalance and was highly related to the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway. Targeted metabolomic in the liver tissues unveiled upregulation of COX-related (PGF2a, 8-iso-PGF2a and PGF2) and LOX-related (LTB4, LTD4, 12S-HETE and 15S-HETE) factors in HFD-treated KO mice. Immunohistochemistry and transcriptional analyses showed that miR-30a-5p affected arachidonic acid metabolism through the LOX/COX pathways. Besides, COX/LOX pathways and hepatic steatosis were reversed after reintroducing miR-30a-5p in HFD-treated KO mice. This study reveals the pivotal mechanism by which miR-30a-5p and intestinal microbes regulate hepatic steatosis and abnormal lipid metabolism, offering promising avenues for NAFLD and atherosclerosis therapeutics. MiR-30a-5p deletion aggravated hepatic steatosis and lipid disorder induced by an HFD in mice. Gut microbiota participated in the regulation of hepatic steatosis in the context of miR-30a-5p. Gut microbiota metabolism-related arachidonic acid metabolic pathway contributed to miR-30a-5p-regulated hepatic steatosis and lipid disorder. Reintroducing miR-30a-5p reversed hepatic steatosis and arachidonic acid metabolism disorder caused by HFD and miR-30a-5p deletion. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are important signaling molecules. A recent study reported hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid, 12-oxo-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid, and (12S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid as chemotherapy resistance-inducing factors when tumor cells were treated with cisplatin. Marine-based food supplements like fish oil or algae extracts are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and can contain large amounts of hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid. Thus, it was concluded that oral uptake of hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid might induce chemoresistance as shown in a mouse model.
